the company’s operations are subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which it does business there also continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by federal state and international regulators of the health and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices in addition many of the company’s pbm clients and the company’s payors in the retailltc segment including insurers medicare plans managed medicaid plans and mcos are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor similarly the company’s ltc clients such as skilled nursing facilities are subject to government regulations including many of the same government regulations to which the company is subject 

the laws and rules governing the company’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the company’s businesses creates areas of uncertainty further there are numerous proposed health care financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal state and international levels some of which could adversely affect the company’s businesses if they are enacted the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change aspects of how it operates in the specific markets in which it competes or the health care industry generally but if changes occur the impact of any such changes could have a material adverse impact on the company’s businesses operating results cash flows andor stock price possible regulatory or legislative changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring the commercial medicare or medicaid marketplace reducing payments to the company in connection with medicare medicaid dual eligible or special needs programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation or changing the laws governing pbms

laws and regulations related to covid19 

the families first coronavirus response act the “families first act” and the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” were enacted in march 2020 each of the families first act and the cares act requires the company to provide coverage for covid19 related medical services in many cases without member costsharing in its insured health care benefits products 

the cares act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing preparing for andor responding to covid19 provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to covid19 under the cares act the company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with covid19 testing and vaccination as well as monoclonal antibody treatment aside from such reimbursement the company has not requested any funding under the cares act however in the second quarter of 2020 the company received 43 million from the cares act provider relief fund all of which was returned to the us department of health and human services “hhs” during the second quarter of 2020 

the cares act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of social security taxes effective march 27 2020 by permitting them to remit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about december 31 2021 and december 31 2022 the company elected to defer approximately 670 million of its social security tax payments during the year ended december 31 2020 the company paid the first of two equal installments in december 2021 and will remit the second installment on or about december 31 2022 as required under the cares act 

congress enacted the american rescue plan act in march 2021 among other changes as a result of this legislation public exchange plan premium subsidies increased for lowincome individuals and became available to people with incomes higher than 400 of the federal poverty limit these changes are currently in effect through the remainder of 2022 and congress may extend or potentially make permanent these policies in subsequent legislation which could cause continued shifts in enrollment into public exchange plans 

in addition to the families first act the cares act and the american rescue plan act the company continues to experience new legislation regulation directives orders and other requirements from federal state county and municipal authorities related to the covid19 pandemic these governmental actions have included but are not limited to requirements to waive member costsharing associated with covid19 testing and treatment provide coverage for additional covid19related services expand the use of telemedicine extend grace periods for payments of premiums or limit coverage termination based on nonpayment of premiums or fees modify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain employee eligibility and facilitate accelerate or advance payments to providers and other requirements related to the public health emergency these requirements may impact different areas of our business differently and for different lengths of time and present financial implications with respect to implementing and unwinding our compliance with these new requirements 

the company has operations that fall within the scope of covid19 vaccine requirements for federal contractors certain health care workers and the requirements of certain jurisdictions such as new york city several of these are subject to judicial challenges we are continuing to closely monitor and update our practices in response to developments or changes in the covid19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state and municipalspecific covid19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions modifications requirements or restrictions regarding employee vaccinations we have a process for employees to request a reasonable accommodation if they are unable to get vaccinated due to a medical condition sincerely held religious belief or any other legally recognized exemption employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to be exempt from the vaccination requirement 

additionally in december 2021 the biden administration reiterated cares act guidance noting commercial health insurers are not required to cover workplace or surveillance testing and announced several new directives and actions to combat covid19 including the expansion of free athome testing to be covered by commercial health insurers for the remainder of the public health emergency on january 10 2022 the hhs announced that commercial health insurers must cover the costs of up to eight rapid otc covid19 test kits per individual per 30day period this requirement will likely impact multiple business operations including increasing benefit costs in our commercial health insurance business and increasing revenues in our retail business the requirement may also result in a decrease in more expensive tests and treatments which could partially mitigate the increase in benefit costs in our commercial health insurance business these impacts will be highly dependent on the overall supply of testing products 

the impact of this governmental activity on the us economy consumer customer and health care provider behavior and health care utilization patterns is beyond our knowledge and control as a result the financial andor operational impact these covid19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the collective impact could be material and adverse 

laws and regulations related to multiple segments of the company’s business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs  the company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims and other information to medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute the “aks” state false claims acts and antikickback statutes in most states the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the false claims act prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs in addition any claim for government reimbursement also violates the false claims act where it results from a violation of the aks 

both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government participants in the health and related benefits industry including the company frequently are subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

the aca  the aca significantly increased federal and state oversight of health plans among other requirements it specifies minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for commercial and medicare insured products specifies features required to be included in commercial benefit designs limits commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new participants to enter the marketplace and includes regulations and processes that could delay or limit the company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates this in turn could adversely affect the company’s ability to continue to participate in certain product lines andor geographies that it serves today 

in june 2021 the united states supreme court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the aca is unconstitutional in its entirety and issued an opinion preserving the aca and its consumer protections in its current form even though the aca was deemed constitutional there may nevertheless be continued efforts to invalidate modify repeal or replace portions of it in addition to litigation parts of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive orders legislation regulations and guidance at the federal or state level the company expects the aca including potential changes thereto to continue to significantly impact its business operations and operating results including pricing medical benefit ratios “mbrs” and the geographies in which the company’s products are available 

medicare regulation  the company’s medicare advantage products compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage products offered by other medicare advantage organizations and medicare supplement products offered by other insurers the company’s medicare pdp and medicare supplement products are products that medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage 

the company continues to expand the number of counties in which it offers medicare products the company has expanded its medicare service area and products in 2022 and is seeking to substantially grow its medicare membership revenue and operating results over the next several years including through growth in medicare supplement products the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare products offered and the medicarerelated provisions of the aca significantly increase the company’s exposure to funding and regulation of and changes in government policy with respect to andor funding or regulation of the various medicare programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs andor new reforms or surcharges on existing programs for example the aca requires minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans of 85 if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms 

due to potential lower utilization of medical services by medicare beneficiaries during the covid19 pandemic it is possible certain medicare advantage contracts may not meet the 85 mlr for consecutive years 

the company’s medicare advantage and pdp products are heavily regulated by cms the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other private participants in medicare programs are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example the medicare advantage overpayment rule issued in 2014 implemented the aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms failure to notify overpayments to cms could result in liability under the false claims act the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation payments the company receives from cms for its medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the us department of justice the “doj” the office of the inspector general of the hhs the “oig” and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the amount of the company’s medicare reimbursement require the company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit the company’s and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare standards and its medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms may seek premium and other refunds prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to passively enroll members in one or more of the company’s medicare or medicaremedicaid demonstration historically known as “dual eligible” plans exclude us from participating in one or more medicare dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms regulations or its medicare contractual requirements the company’s medicare supplement products are regulated at the state level and subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks 

in addition in november 2020 the hhs released the final rebate rule the “rebate rule” which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the aks for rebates from pharmaceutical companies to pbms in medicare part d replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patients with high outofpocket costs and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbors are i for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and ii for flat service fee payments made to pbms which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced and what the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company the pharmaceutical care management association the “pcma” which represents pbms has filed a suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premiums in medicare part d and was adopted in an unlawful manner the bipartisan infrastructure act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to january 2026 and pending reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the rebate rule 

in december 2021 president biden signed the protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act the legislation extends the suspension of the 2 medicare sequester cuts until march 2022 starting in april 2022 the medicare sequester cuts will be phased back in with a 1 cut that will continue through june absent any further changes by congress the 2 medicare sequester would be fully implemented again effective july 1 2022 congress suspended the medicare sequester cuts due to the covid19 pandemic providing a continued increase in medicare advantage and part d plan payments as well as medicare feeforservice provider payments the legislation also includes a 3 increase in the medicare physician fee schedule payments for 2022 congress enacted a similar increase of 375 for 2021 which was set to expire as a result of this increase medicare advantage plans who have contracts with providers based on the medicare physician fee schedule will need to increase their payment rates by 3 this increase became effective in january 2022 and does not include any allowance for the increased medicare advantage costs that result from the provision taken together the two provisions represent a modest increase in medicare advantage costs relative to our expectations for 2022 

currently congress is considering legislation to add additional benefits to medicare part b such as dental hearing and vision benefits the congressional budget office has not yet scored any of the proposals 

going forward the company expects cms the oig the doj other federal agencies and the us congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdps demonstration projects such as medicaremedicaid plans and provider network access and adequacy modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles it is also possible that congress may reform the structure of the medicare part d program and may consider changes to medicare advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by the medicare payment advisory commission and to reduce the potential added cost burden of costly new 

benefits or policies that impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical manufacturers 

it is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or congressional activity any of which could materially and adversely affect the company 

medicare audits  cms regularly audits the company’s performance to determine its compliance with cms’s regulations and its contracts with cms and to assess the quality of services it provides to medicare advantage and pdp beneficiaries for example cms conducts risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits of a subset of medicare advantage contracts for each contract year since 2011 cms has selected certain of the company’s medicare advantage contracts for various years for radv audit and the number of radv audits continues to increase the oig also is auditing the company’s risk adjustment data and that of other companies and the company expects cms and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data the company also has received civil investigative demands “cids” from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of its patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program 

in october 2018 cms issued proposed rules related to among other things changes to the radv audit methodology established by cms in 2012 cms projects that the changes to the radv audit methodology would increase its recoveries from medicare advantage plans as a result of radv audits cms has requested comments on the proposed rules including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audits of medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward and gave notice that it has extended the timeline for publication of the final rules until november 2022 while the company submitted timely comments to the proposed rules if they are adopted as proposed there may be potential adverse effects which could be material on the company’s operating results financial condition and cash flows cms also has announced that its goal is to subject all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year 

medicare star ratings  a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings” the star rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by cms including quality of preventative services chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of four or more stars out of five stars are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates as a result the company’s medicare advantage plans’ operating results in 2022 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings the company’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its medicare operations cms released the company’s 2022 star ratings in october 2021 the company’s 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of its medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023 based on the company’s membership at december 31 2021 87 of the company’s medicare advantage members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 40 stars cms also gives pdps star ratings which affect each pdp’s enrollment medicare advantage and pdp plans that are rated less than three stars for three consecutive years are subject to contract termination by cms cms continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve four stars or more despite the company’s success in achieving high 2022 star ratings and other quality measures and the continuation of its improvement efforts there can be no assurances that it will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years accordingly the company’s medicare advantage plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

medicare benchmark rates  in january 2021 cms issued its final notice detailing final 2022 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates final 2022 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 41 this rate increase only partially offsets the challenge the company faces from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications and cms local and national coverage decisions that require the company to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into the company’s bids the federal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for medicare advantage andor pdp plans or otherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products the company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the company’s continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp programs although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change 

340b drug pricing program – the 340b drug pricing program allows eligible covered entities to purchase prescription drugs from manufacturers at a steep discount and is overseen by the hhs and the health resources and services administration “hrsa” in 2020 a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers began programs that limited covered entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements in may 2021 hrsa sent enforcement letters to 

multiple manufacturers to curb these practices in september 2021 hrsa forwarded the enforcement actions to the oig for potential imposition of civil monetary penalties those enforcement actions are currently subject to ongoing litigation a reduction in covered entities’ participation in contract pharmacy arrangements as a result of the pending enforcement actions or otherwise a reduction in the use of the company’s administrative services by covered entities or a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in the program could materially and adversely affect the company 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs companies involved in public health care programs such as medicare andor medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud waste and abuse and are often the subject of fraud waste and abuse investigations and audits the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare and medicaid program standards ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the company’s compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources 

antitrust and unfair competition  the us federal trade commission “ftc” investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand name drug pricing and rebate practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies in july 2021 the ftc approved several resolutions that direct agency staff to use compulsory process such as subpoenas to investigate seven specific enforcement priorities priority targets include among other businesses health care businesses such as pharmaceutical companies pharmacy benefits managers and hospitals to the extent that the company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy cvs specialty or minuteclinic plays a unique or expanded role in a health care benefits or pharmacy services segment product offering the company’s business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state andor federal regulators andor private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of the company’s activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by the company of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii the company uses and discloses deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use andor disclosure of pii 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” as further modified by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” further arra requires the company and other covered entities to report any breaches of phi to impacted individuals and to the hhs and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to phi criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of arra amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi the hitech act also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates hhs has begun to audit health plans providers and other parties to enforce hipaa compliance including with respect to data security 

in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa including laws that place stricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access to phi states also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the financial modernization act of 1999 also known as the grammleachbliley act “glba” which generally require insurers including health insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer 

shares such information with a nonaffiliated third party like hipaa glba sets a “floor” standard allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the company has made to comply with hipaa and glba 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry in addition states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access deletion protection or transparency such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” states also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity such as the regulations issued by the new york department of financial services complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations which may differ from state to state requires significant resources in addition differing approaches to state privacy andor cybersecurity regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines widelyreported large scale commercial data breaches in the united states and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states these legislative and regulatory developments will impact the design and operation of the company’s businesses its privacy and security strategy and its webbased and mobile assets 

finally each public exchange is required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the public exchange has implemented for itself or nonpublic exchange entities which include insurers offering plans through the public exchange and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws  the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the federal trade commission act the federal postal service act and the consumer product safety act most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription programs in addition the federal government and most states have adopted laws andor regulations requiring places of public accommodation health care services and other goods and services to be accessible to people with disabilities these consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care products and services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities as a result of the company’s directtoconsumer activities including mobile and webbased solutions offered to members and to other consumers the company also is subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations for example the ccpa became effective in 2020 and additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection may be proposed or enacted in 2020 the company expects these new laws and regulations to impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliance costs 

transparency in coverage rule  in october 2020 the hhs the us department of labor “dol” and the us internal revenue service “irs” and together with the hhs and dol the “tridepartments” released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose negotiated prices of drugs medical services supplies and other covered items the rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose costsharing information upon request to a participant beneficiary or enrollee and require plans and issuers to publicly disclose innetwork provider rates historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and the associated billed charges and negotiated rates and historical net prices for prescription drugs disclosure of data in a machine readable file is required beginning in january 2022 and insurers are required to have a consumer tool in place by january 2023 in august 2021 the federal government delayed enforcement of the requirement to publish machinereadable files for innetwork rates outofnetwork allowed amounts and billed charges until july 2022 it also delayed enforcement of machinereadable files related to prescription drug pricing until further rulemaking occurs the public disclosure of insurer or pbmnegotiated price concessions may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers 

additionally the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 was signed into law in december 2020 and contains further transparency provisions requiring group health plans and health insurance issuers to report certain prescription drug costs overall spending on health services and prescription drugs and information about premiums and the impact of rebates and other remuneration on premiums and outofpocket costs to the tridepartments no later than 18 months after the first submission and biannually thereafter the tridepartments will release a public report on drug pricing trends drug reimbursement and the 

impact of drug prices on premiums in august the tridepartments deferred enforcement of both the december 2021 deadline for reporting 2020 plan year data and the june 2022 deadline for reporting 2021 plan year data to december 2022 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act and the telemarketing sales rule give the ftc the federal communications commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions 

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation  the company is subject to a variety of intersecting federal and state statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs operation of retail specialty infusion ltc and mail order pharmacies licensure of facilities and professionals including pharmacists technicians nurses and other health care professionals registration of facilities with the us drug enforcement administration the “dea” and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances packaging storing shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals repackaging of drug products labeling medication guides and other consumer disclosures interactions with prescribers and health care professionals compounding of prescription medications dispensing of controlled and noncontrolled substances counseling of patients transfers of prescriptions advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services security inventory control recordkeeping reporting to boards of pharmacy the us food and drug administration the “fda” the us consumer product safety commission the dea and related state agencies and other elements of pharmacy practice pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of federal state and local agencies with various powers to investigate inspect audit or solicit information including boards of pharmacy and nursing the dea the fda the doj hhs and others many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers conduct audits on a regular basis can impose substantial fines and penalties and may revoke the license registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional 

state insurance hmo and insurance holding company regulation  a number of states regulate affiliated groups of insurers and hmos such as the company under holding company statutes these laws may among other things require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany transfers of assets and transactions between the regulated companies and their affiliates including their parent holding companies the company expects the states in which its insurance and hmo subsidiaries are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control activities of its insurance companies and hmos changes to state insurance hmo andor insurance holding company laws or regulations or changes to the interpretation of those laws or regulations including due to regulators’ increasing concerns regarding insurance company andor hmo solvency due among other things to past and expected payor insolvencies could negatively affect the company’s businesses in various ways including through increases in solvency fund assessments requirements that the company hold greater levels of capital andor delays in approving dividends from regulated subsidiaries 

pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans in addition several states require that pbms become directly registered or licensed with the department of insurance or similar government oversight agency regardless of any arrangements they have with clients pbm licensure laws may include oversight of certain pbm activities and operations and may include auditing of those activities 

the states of domicile of the company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory riskbased capital “rbc” requirements for health and other insurance companies and hmos based on the national association of insurance commissioners’ the “naic” riskbased capital for insurers model act the “rbc model act” these rbc requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and hmos taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products the rbc model act sets forth the formula for calculating rbc requirements which are designed to take into account asset risks insurance risks interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business in general under these laws an insurance company or hmo must submit a report of its rbc level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year at december 31 2021 the rbc level of each of the company’s insurance and hmo subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action 

for information regarding restrictions on certain payments of dividends or other distributions by the company’s hmo and insurance company subsidiaries see note 12 ‘‘shareholders’ equity’’ included in item 8 of this 10k 

the holding company laws for the states of domicile of certain of the company’s subsidiaries also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company such as the 

company’s ultimate parent company cvs health corporation that controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of another person 

certain states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 

government agreements and mandates  from time to time the company andor its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees settlement and other agreements corrective action plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices controlled substances pdps expired products environmental and safety matters marketing and advertising practices pbm ltc and other pharmacy operations and various other business practices certain of these agreements contain ongoing reporting monitoring andor other compliance requirements for the company failure to meet the company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies financial penalties administrative remedies andor exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 

environmental and safety regulation  the company’s businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment public health and employee safety including for example regulations governing the management of hazardous substances the cleaning up of contaminated sites and the maintenance of safe working conditions in the company’s retail locations distribution centers and other facilities governmental agencies at the federal state and local levels continue to focus on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general the company assists plan sponsors in the administration of their health benefit plans including the prescription drug benefit portion of those plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors in addition the company may have fiduciary duties where it has specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

some of the company’s health and related benefits and large case pensions products and services and related fees also are subject to potential issues raised by judicial interpretations relating to erisa under those interpretations together with dol regulations the company may have erisa fiduciary duties with respect to pbm members andor certain general account assets held under contracts that are not guaranteed benefit policies as a result certain transactions related to those general account assets are subject to conflict of interest and other restrictions and the company must provide certain disclosures to policyholders annually the company must comply with these restrictions or face substantial penalties 

in addition erisa generally preempts all state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans but the extent of the preemption continues to be reviewed by courts including the us supreme court for example in december 2020 the us supreme court upheld an arkansas law that among other things mandates a particular pricing methodology establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate prohibits a pbm from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost also in november 2021 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit upheld a north dakota law that regulates employersponsored erisa health plans and certain pbm practices within medicare 

other legislative initiatives and regulatory initiatives  the us federal and state governments as well as governments in other countries where the company does business continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and the company’s businesses operating results andor cash flows for example 

• under the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 significant automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts known as sequestration began in march 2013 including medicare spending cuts of not more than 2 of total program costs per year through 2024 since then congress has extended and modified sequestration a number of times the cares act temporarily suspended medicare sequestration from may 2020 to the end of december 2020 and extended mandatory sequestration to 2030 several subsequent acts have extended the temporary suspension of medicare sequestration through the end of march 2022 at which point a 1 sequestration will take effect april 2022 through june 2022 with the full 2 sequestration due to resume in july 2022 significant uncertainty remains as to whether and how the us congress will proceed with actions that create additional federal revenue andor with entitlement reform the company cannot predict future federal medicare or federal or state medicaid funding levels or the impact that future federal or state budget actions or entitlement program reform if it occurs will have on the company’s businesses operations or operating results but the effects could be materially adverse particularly on the company’s medicare andor medicaid revenues mbrs and operating results 

• the european union’s “eu’s” general data protection regulation “gdpr” began to apply across the eu during 2018 

• other significant legislative andor regulatory measures which are or recently have been under consideration include the following 

• increasing the corporate tax rate 

• eliminating payment of manufacturer’s rebates on prescription drugs to pbms pdps and managed medicaid organizations in connection with federally funded health care programs 

• imposing requirements and restrictions on the design andor administration of pharmacy benefit plans offered by the company’s and its clients’ health plans andor its pbm clients andor the services the company provides to those clients including prohibiting “differential” or “spread” pricing in pbm contracts restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs restricting the company’s ability to require members to obtain drugs through a home delivery or specialty pharmacy restricting the company’s ability to place certain specialty or other drugs in the higher cost tiers of its pharmacy formularies restricting the company’s ability to make changes to drug formularies andor clinical programs limiting or eliminating rebates on pharmaceuticals requiring the use of up front purchase price discounts on pharmaceuticals in lieu of rebates restricting the company’s ability to configure and reimburse its health plan and retail pharmacy provider networks including use of cvs pharmacy locations and restricting or eliminating the use of certain drug pricing methodologies 

• increasing federal or state government regulation of or involvement in the pricing andor purchasing of drugs 

• restricting the company’s ability to limit providers’ participation in its networks andor remove providers from its networks by imposing network adequacy requirements or otherwise including in its medicare and commercial health care benefits products 

• imposing assessments on or to be collected by health plans or health carriers that may or may not be passed through to their customers these assessments may include assessments for insolvency the uninsured uncompensated care medicaid funding or defraying health care provider medical malpractice insurance costs 

• mandating coverage by the company’s and its clients’ health plans for additional conditions andor specified procedures drugs or devices eg high cost pharmaceuticals experimental pharmaceuticals and oral chemotherapy regimens 

• regulating electronic connectivity 

• mandating or regulating the disclosure of provider fee schedules manufacturer’s rebates and other data about the company’s payments to providers andor payments the company receives from pharmaceutical manufacturers 

• mandating or regulating disclosure of provider outcome andor efficiency information 

• prescribing or limiting members’ financial responsibility for health care or other covered services they utilize including restricting “surprise” bills by providers and by specifying procedures for resolving “surprise” bills 

• prescribing payment levels for health care and other covered services rendered to the company’s members by providers who do not have contracts with the company 

• assessing the medical device status of home infusion therapy products andor solutions mobile consumer wellness tools and clinical decision support tools which may require compliance with fda requirements in relation to some of these products solutions andor tools 

• restricting the ability of employers andor health plans to establish or impose member financial responsibility 

• proposals to expand benefits under original medicare 

• amending or supplementing erisa to impose greater requirements on pbms or the administration of employerfunded benefit plans or limit the scope of current erisa preemption which would among other things expose 

the company and other health plans to expanded liability for punitive and other extracontractual damages and additional state regulation 

it is uncertain whether the company can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation on its operating results or cash flows including whether it can recoup through higher premium rates expanded membership or other measures the increased costs of mandated coverage or benefits assessments fees taxes or other increased costs including the cost of modifying its systems to implement any enacted legislation or regulations 

the company’s businesses also may be affected by other legislation and regulations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act creates incentives for whistleblowers to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” there also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states 

health savings accounts health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax fee and subsidy provisions of the aca also are regulated by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service 

the company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability federal and state courts including the us supreme court continue to consider cases and federal and state regulators continue to issue regulations and interpretations addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims the scope of erisa’s fiduciary duty requirements the scope of the false claims act and the preemptive effect of erisa and medicare part d on state laws 

contract audits  the company is subject to audits of many of its contracts including its pbm client contracts its pbm rebate contracts its pbm network contracts its contracts relating to medicare advantage andor medicare part d the agreements the company’s pharmacies enter into with other payors its medicaid contracts and its customer contracts because some of the company’s contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

federal employee health benefits program  the company’s subsidiaries contract with the office of personnel management the “opm” to provide managed health care services under the fehb program in their service areas these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program in addition to other requirements such as the transparency in coverage rule note above opm regulations require that communityrated fehb plans meet a fehb programspecific minimum mlr by plan code and market managing to these rules is complicated by the simultaneous application of the minimum mlr standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the aca the company also has a contractual arrangement with carriers for the fehb program such as the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the fehb act and as part of the fehb program additionally the company manages certain fehb plans on a “costplus” basis these arrangements subject the company to certain aspects of the fehb act and other federal regulations such as the fehb acquisition regulation that otherwise would not be applicable to the company the opm also is auditing the company and its other contractors to among other things verify that plans meet their applicable fehb programspecific mlr and the premiums established under the opm’s insured contracts and costs allocated pursuant to the opm’s costbased contracts are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable fehb program the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against the company if it fails to comply with the fehb program requirements

international regulation  the company has insurance licenses in several foreign jurisdictions and does business directly or through local affiliations in numerous countries around the world the company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the european economic area following the united kingdom’s exit from the eu “brexit” 

the company’s international operations are subject to different and sometimes more stringent legal and regulatory requirements which vary widely by jurisdiction including anticorruption laws economic sanctions laws various privacy insurance tax tariff and trade laws and regulations corporate governance privacy data protection including the eu’s general data protection regulation which began to apply across the eu during 2018 data mining data transfer labor and employment intellectual property consumer protection and investment laws and regulations discriminatory licensing procedures compulsory cessions of reinsurance required localization of records and funds higher premium and income taxes limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership in addition the expansion of the company’s operations into foreign countries increases the company’s exposure to the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering provisions of us law including the fcpa and corresponding foreign laws including the uk bribery act 2010 the “uk bribery act” 

anticorruption laws  the fcpa prohibits offering promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage the company also is subject to applicable anticorruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates in many countries outside the united states health care professionals are employed by the government therefore the company’s dealings with them are subject to regulation under the fcpa violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and there continues to be a heightened level of fcpa enforcement activity by the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the doj the uk bribery act is an anticorruption law that is broader in scope than the fcpa and applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with the uk authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions 

antimoney laundering regulations  certain lines of the company’s businesses are subject to treasury antimoney laundering regulations those lines of business have implemented antimoney laundering policies designed to ensure their compliance with the regulations the company also is subject to antimoney laundering laws in nonus jurisdictions where it operates 

office of foreign assets control  the company also is subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of treasury “ofac” ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes terrorists international narcotics traffickers those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states in addition the company is subject to similar regulations in the nonus jurisdictions in which it operates

laws and regulations related to the health care benefits segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state local and international statutes and regulations governing its health care benefits segment specifically 

overview  differing approaches to state insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its health care benefits products and services across state lines these laws and regulations including the aca restrict how the company conducts its business and result in additional burdens and costs to the company significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies underwriting rules and procedures required benefits sales and marketing activities provider rates of payment restrictions on health plans’ ability to limit providers’ participation in their networks andor remove providers from their networks and financial condition including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements these laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product 

each health insurer and hmo must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business in addition health insurers and hmos are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal applicable laws also restrict the ability of the company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends and certain dividends require prior regulatory approval in addition some of the company’s businesses and related activities may be subject to ppo mco utilization review or tparelated licensure requirements and regulations these licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state but may contain provider network contracting product and rate financial and reporting requirements there also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the company’s delivery of services payment of claims fraud prevention protection of consumer health information and payment for covered benefits and services 

required regulatory approvals  the company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to price market and administer many of its health care benefits products supervisory agencies including cms the center for consumer information and insurance oversight and the dol as well as state health insurance managed care and medicaid agencies have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions 

• grant suspend and revoke the company’s licenses to transact business 

• suspend or exclude the company from participation in government programs 

• suspend or limit the company’s authority to market products 

• regulate many aspects of the products and services the company offers including the pricing and underwriting of many of its products and services 

• assess damages fines andor penalties 

• terminate the company’s contract with the government agency andor withhold payments from the government agency to the company 

• impose retroactive adjustments to premiums and require the company to pay refunds to the government customers andor members 

• restrict the company’s ability to conduct acquisitions or dispositions 

• require the company to maintain minimum capital levels in its subsidiaries and monitor its solvency and reserve adequacy 

• regulate the company’s investment activities on the basis of quality diversification and other quantitative criteria andor 

• exclude the company’s plans from participating in public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” premium rate increases or fail to meet other criteria set by hhs or the applicable state 

the company’s operations current and past business practices current and past contracts and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine regular and special investigations audits examinations and reviews by and from time to time the company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from federal state and international supervisory and enforcement agencies attorneys general and other state federal and international governmental authorities and legislators 

commercial product pricing and underwriting restrictions  pricing and underwriting regulation by states limits the company’s underwriting and rating practices and those of other health insurers particularly for small employer groups and varies by state in general these limitations apply to certain customer segments and limit the company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups or both based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior claim experience in some states these laws and regulations restrict the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes andor reflect reasonable costs in the company’s pricing 

the aca expanded the premium rate review process by among other things requiring the company’s commercial insured rates to be reviewed for “reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level hhs established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate increases equal to or exceeding a federally or lower state specified threshold hhs’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as well as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold these combined state and federal review requirements may prevent further delay or otherwise affect the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes which could adversely affect its mbrs and operating results particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services andor medical cost trend or when such utilization andor trend exceeds the company’s projections 

the aca also specifies minimum mlrs of 85 for large group commercial products and 80 for individual and small group commercial products because the aca minimum mlrs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for commercial products states have and may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” incorporate minimum mlr 

requirements into prospective premium rate filings require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured commercial products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

in addition the company requested increases in its premium rates in its commercial health care benefits business for 2022 and expects to continue to request increases in those rates for 2023 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and rating limits and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments including as a result of the aca the company’s rates also must be adequate to reflect adverse selection in its products particularly in small group commercial products these rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

many of the laws and regulations governing the company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other carriers may charge between new and renewal business andor between groups based on differing characteristics they may also require that carriers disclose to customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage 

recently with respect to quality improvement activities “qias” that health plans report to hhs revised regulations no longer provide insurers the option of reporting a flat amount equal to 08 percent of earned premium in lieu of reporting the insurers actual itemized qia expenditures this change will impact the company’s future mlr calculations and reporting since we have utilized the 08 percent premium election 

medicaid regulation  the company is seeking to substantially grow its medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next several years as a result the company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to the company under those programs 

since 2017 managed medicaid products including those the company offers are subject to a minimum federal mlr of 85 a medicaid managed care quality rating system and provider network adequacy requirements also apply to medicaid products because the federal minimum mlr is structured as a “floor” states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for managed medicaid products states may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured medicaid products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

states continue to consider medicaid expansion however 12 states have still not decided to expand as of 2022 states may opt out of the elements of the aca requiring expansion of medicaid coverage without losing their current federal medicaid funding in addition the election of new governors andor state legislatures may impact states’ previous decisions regarding medicaid expansion although congress enacted incentives for states that had not yet done so to expand medicaid this incentive alone may not persuade holdout states to expand 

in 2021 medicaid mcos faced new requirements and state flexibility that were finalized in the 2020 medicaid managed care final rule states now have flexibility related to rate setting and provider network adequacy that could adversely or positively impact our medicaid plans other changes related to managed care operations include beneficiary communications appeals and grievances and provider directories 

the economic aspects of the medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change medicaid premiums are paid by each state and differ from state to state the federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation for medicaid and dual eligible program reforms or redesigns including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by medicaid mcos and their contracted pbms further program population andor geographic expansions of riskbased managed care increasing beneficiary costsharing or payment levels and changes to benefits reimbursement eligibility criteria provider network adequacy requirements including requiring the inclusion of specified high cost providers in the company’s networks and program structure in some states current medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not be adequate for the company to continue 

program participation the company’s medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states or sponsors of medicaid managed care plans are subject to cancellation by the state or the sponsors of the managed care plans after a short notice period without cause eg when a state discontinues a managed care program or in the event of insufficient state funding 

the company’s medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies which have the right to audit the company’s performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations the company’s medicaid products dual eligible products and chip contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services network requirements including mandatory inclusion of specified highcost providers and other aspects of these programs and by external review organizations which audit medicaid plans on behalf of state medicaid agencies the laws regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other participants in medicaid and dual eligible programs including requirements that the company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms andor state medicaid agencies may fine the company withhold payments to the company seek premium and other refunds terminate the company’s existing contracts elect not to award the company new contracts or not to renew the company’s existing contracts prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the company’s medicaid or dual eligible products exclude the company from participating in one or more medicaid or dual eligible programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms or state regulations or contractual requirements 

the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the medicaid program nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results but the effects could be materially adverse 

federal and state reporting  the company is subject to extensive financial and business reporting requirements including penalties for inaccuracies andor omissions at both the federal and state level the company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from third parties that may not be readily available or reliably provided in all instances the company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to comply with these requirements however the company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailability of or errors in its reports 

product design and administration and sales practices  state andor federal regulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration and marketing and advertising practices including the filing of insurance policy forms the adequacy of provider networks the accuracy of provider directories and the adequacy of disclosure regarding products and their administration is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices medicare medicaid and dual eligible products and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny 

guaranty fund assessmentssolvency protection  under guaranty fund laws existing in all states insurers doing business in those states can be assessed in most states up to prescribed limits for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants the life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of longterm care insurers as well as health insurers the company’s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to the company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes some states have similar laws relating to hmos andor other payors such as notforprofit consumer governed health plans established under the aca while historically the company has ultimately recovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative andor regulatory actions that limit future offsets 

laws and regulations related to the pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation  legislation andor regulations seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect and the company’s ability to standardize 

its pbm products and services across state lines in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the naic and the national council of insurance legislators have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as urac have established voluntary standards regarding pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact the company’s health plan clients andor the services provided to those clients andor the company’s health plans 

the company’s pbm activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels including being subject to the false claims act and state false claims acts and the aks and state antikickback laws these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern andor further restrict critical pbm practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers use of administration of andor changes to drug formularies maximum allowable cost “mac” list pricing average wholesale prices “awp” andor clinical programs the offering to plan sponsors of pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread” ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pbm and the price paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider reconciliation to pricing guarantees disclosure of data to third parties drug um practices the level of duty a pbm owes its customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of the company’s pharmacies including audits of its pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to members’ drug utilization and registration or licensing of pbms failure by the company or one of its pbm services suppliers to comply with these laws or regulations could result in material fines andor sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results andor cash flows 

the company’s pbm service contracts including those in which the company assumes certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of pbm activities due to legislation passing in a number of states requiring pbms to register or obtain a license with the department including through market conduct examinations and other audits our licensed entities in addition rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements pharmacy reimbursement for generics mac reimbursement and pharmacy audits  most of which fall under the state insurance code 

mostfavorednation rule  in november 2020 hhs released the mostfavorednation rule the “mfn rule” which requires cms to take a mostfavorednation approach in calculating payment for medicare part b drugs the mfn rule will test paying part b drugs at comparable amounts to the lowest adjusted price paid by any country in the organization for economic cooperation and development that has a gross domestic product “gdp” per capita that is at least 60 of the us gdp per capita the mfn rule will also test a redesign of the percentage addon payment structure under medicare part b to remove incentives for use of highercost drugs through a flat perdose addon payment and will include a financial hardship exemption for participants the mandatory mfn rule will operate for seven years from january 1 2021 to december 31 2027 over the course of the model cms will monitor and evaluate the impact of the mfn rule on beneficiary access to drugs program costs and the quality of care for beneficiaries further cms commits to assess initial impacts of the mfn rule on quality of care including access to drugs prior to beginning performance year 5 multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers have sued hhs over the rule and it is currently delayed due to a temporary restraining order prohibiting cms from implementing it if implemented the mfn rule may impact the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers in august 2021 cms published a proposed rule to rescind the mfn rule it is unclear whether this rescission may be followed by regulatory or legislative alternatives that present similar or even more substantial patient access provider reimbursement and other concerns 

pharmacy network access legislation  medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s and its health plans’ and its health plan clients’ ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers for example certain “any willing provider” legislation may require the company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s ability and the company’s and its client health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the company for payment these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the company identifies through pharmacy audits 

finally several states have passed legislation that limits the ability of pbms and health insurers to provide special benefit structures for use with affiliated pharmacies which could result in reduced savings to clients and consumers 

pharmacy pricing legislation  a number of states have passed legislation regulating the company’s ability to manage and establish macs for generic prescription drugs mac methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors including cms to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay for at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs additionally some states have passed legislation that would create a reimbursement benchmark mandate such as the national average drug acquisition cost andor the wholesale acquisition cost “wac” plus a set dispensing fee for pharmacies in the network 

formulary and plan design regulation  a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under the aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state public exchanges additionally the naic and health care accreditation agencies like ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect the company’s ability to develop and administer formularies pharmacy networks and other plan design features similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices

the spread of impact of and response to covid19 underscores and amplifies certain risks we face the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be material and adverse 

covid19 has spread to every state in the us has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization and has severely impacted and is expected to continue to severely impact the economies of the us and other countries around the world 

the legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently including the families first act the cares act the american rescue plan act and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our health care benefits insured products as a result of covid19 including legislative andor regulatory responses to covid19 the premiums we charge in our insured health care benefits products may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our insured medical members which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs 

federal state and local governmental policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 including existing and new variants such as mask and vaccination mandates restrictions on large gatherings and social distancing directives may not effectively combat the severity andor duration of the covid19 pandemic and have resulted in among other things a reduction in utilization that is discretionary the cancellation of elective medical procedures reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies our customers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations the adoption of workfromhome policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to reductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records all of which impact our businesses among other impacts of these policies and initiatives on our businesses there may be changes in medical claims submission patterns and an adverse impact on i drug utilization due to the reduction in discretionary visits with providers ii front store sales as a result of reduced customer traffic in our retail pharmacies iii medical membership in our health care benefits segment and covered lives in our pbm clients due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers including due to business failures as well as reduced willingness to change benefits providers by prospective customers iv benefit costs due to covid19 related support programs we have put in place for our medical members and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our insured health care benefits products and v the amount timing and collectability of payments to the company from customers clients government payers and members as a result of the impact of covid19 on them over time these policies and initiatives also may cause us to experience increased benefit costs andor decreased revenues in our health care benefits segment if as a result of our medical members not seeing their providers as a result of covid19 we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage benefit costs and chronic conditions of our medical members and appropriately document their risk profiles 

in addition in response to covid19 during the first half of 2020 we began to offer our medical members expanded benefit coverage and became obligated by governmental action to provide other additional coverage this expanded benefit coverage continued to be provided without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our insured health care benefits 

products we also are taking actions designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health care provider community such measures and any further steps we take or are required to take to expand or otherwise modify the services delivered to our health care benefits members provide relief for the health care provider community or in connection with the relaxation of social distancing directives and other restrictions on movement and economic activity intended to reduce the spread of covid19 including the potential for widespread testing and vaccination including boosters as a component of lifting those measures could adversely impact our benefit costs mbr and operating results 

the various initiatives we have implemented to slow andor reduce the impact of covid19 and the covid19related support programs we have put in place for our customers medical members and colleagues have increased our operating expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations our operating results will continue to be adversely affected so long as these initiatives continue or if they are expanded in addition any adverse economic conditions that could be caused by covid19 may have an adverse impact on our net investment income and the value of our investment portfolio 

the spread of covid19 or actions taken to mitigate its spread could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities labor shortages andor financial difficulties experienced by thirdparty service providers disruptions in our supply chains our distribution chains andor public and private infrastructure including those caused by industry capacity constraints material availability global logistics delays and constraints arising from among other things the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and labor availability constraints could materially and adversely impact our business operations we have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 as have a significant number of our thirdparty service providers which may amplify certain risks to our businesses including an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other thirdparties and increased risk of business interruptions 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the severity and duration of the pandemic and scope and intensity of the governmental response to it are unknown at this time we believe covid19’s impact on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic vaccination rates the severity of any new covid19 variants and whether vaccines are effective in combating them the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of any additional stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to the pandemic those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material covid19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations and claims against us 

risks relating to our businesses 

we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs which could adversely affect our health care benefits segment’s operating results there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections 

as a result of covid19 the current economic environment is adverse and less predictable than recently experienced which has caused and may continue to cause unanticipated and significant volatility in our health care and other benefits costs including covid19 related testing and vaccination and postacute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs in january 2021 the president of the united states issued an executive order to support government efforts to expand access availability and use of covid19 diagnostic screening and surveillance and addressed the cost of covid19 testing by facilitating covid19 testing free of charge to those who lack comprehensive health insurance and clarifying group health plans’ and health insurance issuers’ obligations to provide coverage for covid19 testing in january 2022 the hhs announced that commercial health insurers must cover the cost of up to eight rapid covid19 otc test kits per individual per 30day period in addition the timing of vaccine administration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new more infectious strains of the covid19 virus and whether the vaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our mbr premiums for our insured health care benefits products which comprised 93 of our health care benefits revenues for 2021 are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period which is generally twelve months these forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increases in excess of 

our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums as a result our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends for 2022 those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing vaccines direct covid19 treatment and deferred care riskadjusted revenue has been adjusted for deferred care and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment though covid19 related impacts remain uncertain during periods when health care and other benefit costs utilization andor medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of covid19 accurately detecting forecasting managing reserving and pricing for our and our selfinsured customers’ medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing and our health care and other benefit costs including covid19 related testing and vaccination and postacute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs are affected by covid19 and other external events over which we have no control even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our health care benefits segment’s operating results 

a number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs including covid19 previously uninsured members entering the health care system changes in members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes including under the families first act the cares act and the american rescue plan act changes in the health status of our members the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics advances in medical technology increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultrahigh cost drugs and therapies directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers the increasing influence of social media on our members’ health care utilization and other behaviors changes in health care practices and general economic conditions such as inflation and employment levels in addition governmentimposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time and future amendments to the aca that increase the uninsured population may amplify this problem other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics changes as a result of the aca changes to the aca and other changes in the regulatory environment the evolution toward a consumer driven business model new technologies influenzarelated health care costs which may be substantial and higher than we expected clusters of highcost cases health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control for example the 20202021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of covid19 and the 20192020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza than the 20182019 influenza season 

our health care benefits segment’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect the factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results these risks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs utilization andor medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of covid19 such risks are further magnified by the aca and other existing and future legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections 

adverse economic conditions in the us and abroad can materially and adversely impact our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

adverse economic conditions in the us and abroad including those caused by covid19 can materially and adversely impact our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition including 

• in our pharmacy services segment by causing drug utilization to decline reducing demand for pbm services and adversely affecting the financial health of our pbm clients 

• in our retailltc segment by causing drug utilization to decline changing consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns leading to reduced consumer demand for products sold in our stores and adversely affecting the financial health of our ltc pharmacy customers 

• by causing our existing customers to reduce workforces including due to business failures which would reduce our revenues the number of covered lives in our pbm clients andor the number of members our health care benefits segment serves 

• by causing our clients and customers and potential clients and customers particularly those with the most employees or members and state and local governments to force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service including service discount and other performance guarantees to retain or obtain their business 

• by causing customers and potential customers of our health care benefits and retailltc segments to purchase fewer products andor products that generate less profit for us than the ones they currently purchase or otherwise would have purchased 

• by causing customers and potential customers of our health care benefits segment particularly smaller employers and individuals to forego obtaining or renewing their health and other coverage with us 

• in our health care benefits segment by causing unanticipated increases and volatility in utilization of medical and other covered services including covid19 related testing vaccination and behavioral health services by our medical members changes in medical claim submission patterns andor increases in medical unit costs andor provider behavior each of which would increase our costs and limit our ability to accurately detect forecast manage reserve and price for our and our selfinsured customers’ medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs 

• by increasing medical unit costs and causing changes in provider behavior in our health care benefits segment as hospitals and other providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own covid19related and other economic challenges 

• by weakening the ability or perceived ability of the issuers andor guarantors of the debt or other securities we hold in our investment portfolio to perform on their obligations to us which could result in defaults in those securities and has reduced and may further reduce the value of those securities and has created and may continue to create net realized capital losses for us that reduce our operating results 

• by weakening the ability of our customers including selfinsured customers in our health care benefits segment medical providers and the other companies with which we do business as well as our medical members to perform their obligations to us or causing them not to perform those obligations either of which could reduce our operating results 

• by weakening the ability of our former subsidiaries andor their purchasers to satisfy their lease obligations that we have guaranteed and causing the company to be required to satisfy those obligations 

• by weakening the financial condition of other insurers including longterm care insurers and life insurers which increases the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers to policyholders and claimants 

• by causing over time inflation that could cause interest rates to increase and thereby increase our interest expense and reduce our operating results as well as decrease the value of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio which would reduce our operating results andor adversely affect our financial condition 

furthermore reductions in workforce by our customers can cause unanticipated increases in the health care and other benefits costs of our health care benefits segment for example our business associated with members who have elected to receive benefits under consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act known as “cobra” typically has an mbr that is significantly higher than our overall commercial mbr 

each of our segments operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment and operating income in the industries in which we compete may decline 

each of our segments health care benefits pharmacy services which includes our pbm business and retailltc operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment specifically 

• as competition increases in the geographies in which we operate including competition from new entrants a significant increase in price compression andor reimbursement pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive 

• in our health care benefits segment we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan membership over the next several years in many instances to acquire and retain our government 

customers’ business we must bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment winning bids often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency 

• customer contracts in our health care benefits segment are generally for a period of one year and our customers have considerable flexibility in moving between us and our competitors one of the key factors on which we compete for customers especially in uncertain economic environments is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results in response to rising prices our customers may elect to selfinsure or to reduce benefits in order to limit increases in their benefit costs alternatively our customers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable such elections may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured products andor lower premiums for our insured products which may adversely affect our revenues and operating results although such elections also may reduce our health care and other benefit costs in addition our medicare medicaid and chip products are subject to termination without cause periodic rebid rate adjustment and program redesign as customers seek to contain their benefit costs particularly in an uncertain economy and our exposure to this risk is increasing as we grow our government products membership these actions may adversely affect our membership revenues and operating results 

• we requested increases in our premium rates in our commercial health care benefits business for 2021 and expect to request increases in those rates for 2022 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and rating limits and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by federal and state governments including as a result of the aca our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selected by people with a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable products also known as “adverse selection” particularly in small group commercial products these rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

• the competitive success of our pharmacy services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies as pbm clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

• the competitive success of our retailltc segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms as the payors’ clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

• in our pbm business we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer’s rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual requirements including the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline our operating results cash flows andor prospects could be adversely affected 

• the pbm industry has been experiencing price compression as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices increased revenue sharing including sharing in a larger portion of rebates received from drug manufacturers enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trends to continue 

• our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operations have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition including client demands for lower prices generic drug pricing earlier than expected generic drug introductions and network reimbursement pressure if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 

• a shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates as a result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect our margins including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day prescriptions at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions 

• pbm client contracts often are for a period of approximately three years however pbm clients may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to contract expiration pbm clients are generally well informed can move between us and our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts we are therefore under pressure to contain price increases despite being faced with increasing drug costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely 

affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 

• the operating results and margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements and by the financial health of and purchases and sales of our ltc customers 

in addition competitors in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition also may come from new entrants and other sources in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in the rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such alterations and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example decisions to buy our health care benefits and pharmacy services products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers either through direct purchasing eg medicare advantage plans and pdps or through public exchanges and private health insurance exchanges that allow individual choice consumers also are increasingly seeking to access consumer goods and health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile devices and websites to compete effectively in the consumerdriven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences 

changes in marketplace dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and decisions to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor prospects 

we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully on public exchanges or that our pricing or other actions will result in the profitability of our public exchange products 

in january 2022 we entered into the public exchanges in eight states to compete effectively on public exchanges we have developed or acquired the technology systems tools and talent necessary to interact with public exchanges and engage public exchange consumers through enhanced consumerfocused sales marketing channels and customer interfaces we have also created new customer service programs and product offerings while participating on the public exchanges we will have to respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and regulators as well as potentially disruptive new entrants which could reduce our profit margins due to the price transparency provided by public exchanges when we market products we face competitive pressures from existing and new competitors who may have lower cost structures our competitors may bring their public exchange and other consumer products to market more quickly have greater experience marketing to consumers andor may be targeting the higher margin portions of our business we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or profitably on public exchanges or that we will be able to benefit from any opportunities presented by public exchanges 

in addition there can be no assurance that our pricing or other actions will result in the profitability of our public exchange products in 2022 or any future year we have set 2022 premium rates for our public exchange products based on our projections including as to the health status and quantity of membership and utilization of medical andor other covered services by members the accuracy of the projections reflected in our pricing may be impacted by i adverse selection among individuals who require or utilize more expensive medical andor other covered services ii other plans’ withdrawals from participation in the public exchanges we serve and iii legislation regulations enforcement activity andor judicial decisions that cause public exchanges to operate in a manner different than what we projected in setting our premium rates 

a change in our health care benefits product mix may adversely affect our profit margins 

our insured health care benefits products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc products historically smaller employer groups have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures although over the last several years even relatively small employers have moved to asc products we also serve and expect to grow our business with governmentsponsored programs including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profit margins than our commercial insured health care benefits products a shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on the health care benefits segment’s operating results 

negative public perception of the industries in which we operate or of our industries’ or our practices can adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and prospects 

our brand and reputation are two of our most important assets and the industries in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public from time to time negative publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage litigation against us and other industry participants the ongoing public debates over drug pricing pbms government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing changes to the aca “surprise” medical bills governmental hearings andor investigations actual or perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products andor business practices including pbm operations drug pricing and insurance coverage determinations and social media and other media relations activities negative publicity also may come from a failure to meet customer expectations for consistent high quality and accessible care this risk may increase as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data and as our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumers 

in addition by working with the us government in the distribution and administration of the covid19 vaccine the company may be subject to negative publicity related to the government’s actions in response to covid19 that are outside of the ability of the company to control 

negative public perception andor publicity of our industries in general or of us or our key vendors brokers or product distribution networks in particular can further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results and our stock price by 

• adversely affecting our brand and reputation 

• adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our products andor services andor retain our existing customers and members 

• requiring us to change our products andor services 

• reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our products andor services andor 

• increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirements with which we must comply 

we must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services including proprietary brands 

the success of our businesses depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and clients and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products we also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retail operations including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our retail business operating results cash flows andor financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating results and erode customer loyalty 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of our 

specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business operating results and cash flows 

we face risks relating to the availability pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

the profitability of our retailltc and pharmacy services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products we dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacies and the retail pharmacies in our pbm’s network also dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs our revenues operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced including due to 

• increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions 

• manufacturing or other supply issues 

• a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in federal programs 

• certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to overthecounter products 

• future fda rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products 

• the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products or 

• inflation in the price of drugs 

in addition increased utilization of generic drugs which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 

the reserves we hold for expected claims in our insured health care benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited 

a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the mlr rules of the aca cms and the opm and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program 

our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns andor procedures turnover and other changes in membership changes in product mix changes in the utilization of medical andor other covered services including prescription drugs changes in medical cost trends changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products we estimate health care costs payable periodically and any resulting adjustments including premium deficiency reserves are reflected in currentperiod operating results within benefit costs for example as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we established a premium deficiency reserve of 16 million and 11 million respectively related to medicaid products in the health care benefits segment a worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of december 31 2021 would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results these risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical andor other covered services andor medical cost trends are below 

recent historical levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risks are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

our operating results are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve 

our businesses are affected by the us economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve including various economic factors including inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment could cause a decline in drug utilization an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores 

if our customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing our customers may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition both state and federal government sponsored payers as a result of budget deficits or spending reductions may suspend payments or seek to reduce their health care expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us 

further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms and the value of our investment portfolio adverse changes in the us economy consumer confidence and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future andor decrease our prescription volumes 

in addition our health care benefits membership remains concentrated in certain us geographies and in certain industries unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefits segment’s operating results our health care benefits membership has been and may continue to be affected by workforce reductions by our customers due to adverse andor uncertain general economic conditions especially in the us geographies and industries where our membership is concentrated as a result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefits membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenues and operating results may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers 

we are exposed to risks relating to the solvency of other insurers 

we are subject to assessments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies including longterm care insurers hmos aca coops and other payors to policyholders and claimants for example in the first quarter of 2017 aetna recorded a discounted estimated liability expense of 231 million pretax for our estimated share of future assessments for longterm care insurer penn treaty network america insurance company and one of its subsidiaries guaranty funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer hmo aca coop andor other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its financial obligations these funds are usually financed by assessments against insurers regulated by a state future assessments may have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 

extreme events or the threat of extreme events could materially impact our businesses and health care including behavioral health costs 

nuclear biological or other attacks or other acts of violence including active shooter situations whether as a result of war or terrorism or otherwise other manmade disasters natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons or extreme weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornados whether as a result of climate change or otherwise epidemics pandemics and other extreme events can affect the us economy in general our industries and us specifically in particular such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could result in significant health care including behavioral health costs which also would be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and other insurers such extreme events or the threat of 

such extreme events also could disrupt our supply chains andor our distribution chains for the products we sell in addition our employees and those of our vendors are concentrated in certain large metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed to these events such events could adversely affect our businesses operating results and cash flows and in the event of extreme circumstances our financial condition or viability particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors 

we may be unable to achieve our environmental social and governance goals 

we are dedicated to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and face pressures from our colleagues customers and stockholders to make significant advancements in environmental social and governance matters in part to address these concerns we established certain goals as part of our esg strategy achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control and it is possible that we may fail to achieve these goals or that our colleagues customers or stockholders might not be satisfied with our efforts these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of renewable energy and other materials compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to climaterelated goals laborrelated regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors the actions of competitors and competitive pressures an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar goals or whose progress towards reaching its goals is not as advanced as ours and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid19 pandemic a failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business employee morale or customer or stockholder support 

further an increasing percentage of colleagues customers and stockholders considers sustainability factors in making employment consumer health care and investment decisions if we are unable to meet our goals we may lose colleagues and have difficulty recruiting new colleagues investors customers or partners our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively all of which would have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

risks from changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to potential changes in public policy laws and regulations including reform of the us health care system which can adversely affect our businesses entitlement program reform if it occurs could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operations andor operating results 

the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operations and operating results could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation andor increased regulation of pbms including changes to the regulatory environment for health care and related benefits including medicare the aca and related public exchange regulations changes to laws or regulations governing drug reimbursement andor pricing changes to the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changes to laws andor regulations governing drug manufacturers’ rebates changes to laws andor regulations governing reimbursements paid to pharmacists by andor reporting required by pbms changes to immigration policies andor other public policy initiatives it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of us presidential executive orders other significant changes to health care and related benefits system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries also are possible and could adversely affect our businesses if we fail to respond adequately to such changes including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives or do not respond as effectively as our competitors our businesses operations and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

efforts to amend the aca and related regulations are possible it is also possible that federal and state governments will continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and our businesses further changes to federal health care and related benefits laws including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing laws laws governing pbms andor laws governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs are probable we cannot predict the effect if any that new health care and related benefits legislation future changes to the aca or the implementation of or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca may have on our health care benefits pharmacy services andor retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy operations andor operating results the federal and many 

state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation enforcement andor application of existing programs laws and regulations including changes to payments under and funding of medicare and medicaid programs and increased regulation of pbms 

further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of pbms including network restrictions formulary management affiliate reimbursement contractual guarantees and reconciliations or other pbm services drug pricing or purchasing patent term extensions andor purchase discount andor rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers also could reduce the discounts or rebates we receive changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees also could adversely affect our profitability for example on october 29 2020 the hhs released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose drug pricing and costsharing information the final rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose costsharing information upon request to a participant beneficiary or enrollee which unless otherwise indicated for the purpose of the final rules includes an authorized representative and requires plans and issuers to disclose innetwork provider rates historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and the associated billed charges and negotiated rates for prescription drugs while the specific regulation requiring pbms to disclose negotiated price concessions was paused under federal guidance released in august 2021 if it resurfaces the regulation may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers 

in addition in november 2020 the hhs released the rebate rule which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the aks for rebates from pharmaceutical companies to pbms in medicare part d and in medicaid mcos replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patients with high outofpocket costs and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbors are i for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and ii for flat service fee payments made to pbms which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs the pcma which represents pbms has filed a suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premiums in medicare part d and was adopted in an unlawful manner it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced and what the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company the bipartisan infrastructure act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to january 2026 and pending reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the rebate rule 

additionally the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 was signed into law in december 2020 and contains transparency provisions requiring group health plans and health insurance issuers to report certain prescription drug costs overall spending on health services and prescription drugs and information about premiums and the impact of rebates and other remuneration on premiums and outofpocket costs to the tridepartments no later than 18 months after the first submission and biannually thereafter the tridepartments will release a public report on drug pricing trends drug reimbursement and the impact of drug prices on premiums in august the tridepartments deferred enforcement of both the december 2021 deadline for reporting 2020 plan year data and the june 2022 deadline for reporting 2021 plan year data to december 2022 

we cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operations or operating results which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matters it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we compete examples of such changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation changing the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits or significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 

for more information on these matters see “government regulation” included in item 1 of this 10k 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations many of which are highly complex we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions including monetary penalties or suffer brand and reputational harm 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state federal and international governmental authorities the laws and regulations governing our operations and interpretations of those laws and regulations including those related to human capital and climate change are increasing in number and complexity change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflict with one another in general these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers members and providers rather than us or our investors in addition the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year we also must follow various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries put in place by certain state regulators 

certain of our pharmacy services and retailltc operations products and services are subject to 

• the clinical quality patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors any failure by our pharmacy services andor retailltc operations to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of drugs could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

• federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern our relationship with drug manufacturers customers and consumers 

• compliance requirements under erisa including fiduciary obligations in connection with the development and implementation of items such as drug formularies and preferred drug listings and 

• federal and state legislative proposals andor regulatory activity that could adversely affect pharmacy benefit industry practices 

our health care benefits products are highly regulated particularly those that serve medicare medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs and small group commercial customers and members the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare advantage including dual eligible special needs plans medicare part d medicaid and managed medicaid plans are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for noncompliance 

the scope of the practices and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit and we are a defendant in a number of such proceedings if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the false claims act we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs including medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs and we also may be required to pay significant fines andor other monetary penalties whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies the significant incentives and protections provided to whistleblowers under applicable law increase the risk of whistleblower suits 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations that apply to government programs we could be subject to criminal fines civil penalties premium refunds prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs plan and other programs and on our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses profitability and growth also may be adversely affected by i judicial and regulatory decisions that change andor expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations impose medical or bad faith liability increase our responsibilities under erisa or the remedies available under erisa or reduce the scope of erisa preemption of state law claims or ii other legislation and regulations for example in december 2020 the us supreme court upheld an arkansas law that among other things mandates a particular pricing methodology establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate prohibits a pbm from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost also in november 2021 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit upheld a north dakota law that regulates employersponsored erisa health plans and certain pbm practices within medicare 

if our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatory actions andor litigation 

in addition to being subject to extensive and complex regulations many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements in order to be eligible to offer certain products or bid on certain contracts we must demonstrate that we have robust systems and processes in place that are designed to maintain compliance with all applicable legal regulatory and contractual requirements these systems and processes frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers and regulators if our systems and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements and to prevent and detect instances of or the potential for noncompliance fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions litigation and other proceedings which may result in damages fines suspension or loss of licensure suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs andor other penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we routinely are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings including class actions and qui tam actions many of these proceedings seek substantial damages which may not be covered by insurance these proceedings are costly to defend may result in changes in our business practices harm our brand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and operating results 

pbm retail pharmacy mail order pharmacy specialty pharmacy ltc pharmacy and health care and related benefits are highly regulated industries whose participants frequently are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings we are currently subject to various litigation and arbitration matters investigations regulatory audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and other legal proceedings both inside and outside the us outside the us contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the us litigation related to our provision of professional services in our medical clinics pharmacies and ltc operations is increasing as we expand our services along the continuum of health care 

litigation and particularly securities derivative collective or class action and qui tam litigation is often expensive and disruptive many of the legal proceedings against us seek substantial damages including noneconomic or punitive damages and treble damages and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in our business practices while we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage andor the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability also may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the outcome of litigation and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law or regulation can and do occur and the costs incurred frequently are substantial regardless of the outcome litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses operating results andor cash flows because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings see item 3 of this 10k for additional information 

we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in material refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities and other sanctions 

as one of the largest national retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacy pbm and health care and related benefits providers we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental market conduct and other audits investigations and reviews by and we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from various federal and state agencies regulatory authorities attorneys general committees subcommittees and members of the us congress and other state federal and international governmental authorities for example we have received cids from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program cms and the oig also are auditing the risk adjustmentrelated data of certain of our medicare advantage plans and the number of such audits continues to increase several such audits investigations and reviews by governmental authorities currently are pending some of which may be resolved in 2022 the results of which may be adverse to us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical andor other covered services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy 

rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources in addition our medical costs and the medical expenses of our health care benefits asc customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by providers andor members 

regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews by federal state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in significant or material premium refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure any of these audits investigations or reviews could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us 

see “legal and regulatory proceedings” in note 16 ‘‘commitments and contingencies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information 

our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as we offer new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical core businesses of health care benefits pharmacy services and retailltc 

historically we focused primarily on providing health care benefits pharmacy services and retailltc products and services as a result of our transformation program and other innovation initiatives we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new products and services such as the home hemodialysis device we are developing which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically have offered 

the increased volume of business in areas beyond our historical core businesses and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that are different from the risks of providing health care benefits pharmacy services and retailltc products and services and increase significantly our exposure to other risks 

we face unique regulatory and other challenges in our medicare and medicaid businesses 

we are seeking to substantially grow the medicare and medicaid membership in our health care benefits segment in 2022 and over the next several years we face unique regulatory and other challenges that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those businesses 

• in january 2021 cms issued its final notice detailing final 2022 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates final 2022 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 41 we cannot predict future medicare funding levels the impact of future federal budget actions or ensure that such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our medicare operating results 

• the organic expansion of our medicare advantage and medicare part d service area is subject to the ability of cms to process our requests for service area expansions and our ability to build cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements cms’ decisions on our requests for service area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations 

• cms regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with cms’s regulations and our contracts with cms and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our medicare members as a result of these audits we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustments to andor withholding of certain premiums and fees fines criminal liability civil monetary penalties cms imposed sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs or other restrictions on our medicare medicaid and other businesses including suspension or loss of licensure 

• “star ratings” from cms for our medicare advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans’ operating results only medicare advantage plans with a star rating of four or higher out of five are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates cms continues to change its rating system to make achieving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult our star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations if our star ratings fall below four for a significant portion of our medicare advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated our revenues operating results and cash flows may be significantly adversely affected 

• payments we receive from cms for our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals we enroll elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the amount of our medicare reimbursement require us to raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit our and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

• changes to the ability of pbms to have pharmacy performance programs in place for clients and report payments via direct and indirect reporting mechanisms could impact the pharmacy services business 

• medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of the aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules clients of our pbm business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d products 

• our medicare part d operating results and our ability to expand our medicare part d business could be adversely affected if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our medicare part d business changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies the government alters medicare part d program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons the government mandated use of pointofsale manufacturer’s rebates effective in 2022 continues the government enacts price controls on certain pharmaceutical products in medicare part d the government makes changes to how pharmacy payforperformance is calculated or reinsurance thresholds are reduced below their current levels 

• we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid operating results and cash flows andor our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

• if we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a cms audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines civil monetary penalties or other sanctions including fines and penalties under the false claims act which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part d or other government programs and on our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

• certain of our medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and in part to set premium rates we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate or to correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid operating results and cash flows andor our ability to successfully bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase as our government funded businesses grow our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases 

the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare advantage including dual eligible special needs plans medicare part d medicaid and managed medicaid plans are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for noncompliance federal state and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with 

us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities 

the us federal government and our other government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs cancel or decline to renew contracts with us or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs the services provided to enrollees in such programs our premiums and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows when federal funding is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive and we remain liable for and are required to fund claims from providers for providing services to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate an extended federal government shutdown or a delay by congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling also could lead to a delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could in turn have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses operating results cash flows and liquidity 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm and retailltc businesses 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry regulators or federal policymakers may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp or wac which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts drug purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” the use of an aac basis in fee for service medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practices in health care benefits’ commercial and other government products it is also possible that congress may enact some limited form of price negotiation for medicare in addition cms also publishes the national average drug acquisition cost “nadac” for certain drugs nadac pricing is being adopted in an increasing number of states 

future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from our pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with drug manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections we cannot predict the effect of these possible changes on our businesses 

we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increases in our insured health care benefits products which would have an adverse effect on our revenues mbrs and operating results and could magnify the adverse impact of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of aca assessments fees and taxes 

premium rates for our insured health care benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval which creates risk for us in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires a review by hhs in conjunction with state regulators of premium rate increases that exceed a federally specified threshold or lower statespecific thresholds set by states determined by hhs to have adequate processes rate reviews can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins mbrs and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit costs increased utilization of covered services and aca assessments fees and taxes by restricting our ability to reflect these increases andor these assessments fees and taxes in our pricing further our ability to reflect aca assessments fees and taxes in our medicare medicaid and chip premium rates is limited 

since 2013 hhs has issued determinations to health plans that their premium rate increases were “unreasonable” and we continue to experience challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in certain states regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rate increases either by enforcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards regulators or legislatures in several states also have conducted hearings on proposed premium rate increases which can result and in some instances have resulted in substantial delays in implementing proposed rate increases even if they ultimately are approved our plans can be excluded from participating in small group public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the 

likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could adversely affect our mbrs and lead to operating margin compression 

we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our insured health care benefits products we may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies if we are unable to obtain adequate premium rates andor premium rate increases it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and mbrs and our ability to earn adequate returns on insured health care benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies andor products 

minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefits products while leaving us exposed to higher than expected medical costs challenges to our minimum mlr rebate methodology andor reports could adversely affect our operating results 

the aca’s minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in health care benefits’ commercial insured and medicare insured businesses cms minimum mlr rebate regulations limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portions of our health care benefits medicaid and fehb program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebates payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirements are detailed cms has also proposed but not yet finalized a definition of “prescription drug price concessions” for commercial mlr calculation purposes which would make additional pbm information available to plans and the hhs potentially further complicating the mlr calculation process federal and state auditors are challenging our commercial health care benefits business’ compliance with the aca’s minimum mlr requirements as well as our fehb plans’ compliance with opm’s fehb programspecific minimum mlr requirements our medicare and medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum mlr audits if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms additional challenges to our methodology andor reports relating to minimum mlr and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible the outcome of these audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity 

congress and certain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business including increased minimum wages and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave in addition our employeerelated operating costs may be increased by union organizing activity and it is possible that the national labor relations board may adopt regulatory changes through remaking or case law that could facilitate union organizing if we are unable to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases our operating results will be adversely affected 

we face international political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domestic operations 

our international operations present political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations these risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation climate change regulation nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints our international products need to meet countryspecific customer and member preferences as well as countryspecific legal requirements including those related to licensing data privacy data storage and data protection 

our international operations increase our exposure to and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of nonus jurisdictions such as the eu’s gdpr and the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws of the united states including the fcpa and the united kingdom including the uk bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions implementing our compliance policies internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resources over several years before any significant revenues or profits are generated violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we 

must regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our businesses and operations our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results andor financial condition 

our international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages cultures legal and regulatory schemes and time zones our international operations encounter labor laws standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate in some countries we are required to or choose to operate with local business associates which requires us to manage our relationships with these third parties and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges 

in some countries we may be exposed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting local currencies into us dollars or other currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues operating results and cash flows from our international operations some of our operations are and are increasingly likely to be in emerging markets where these risks are heightened any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective 

risks associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies we acquire 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company also may be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies andor growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

• integrating personnel operations and systems including internal control environments and compliance policies while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent high quality products and services 

• coordinating geographically dispersed organizations 

• disrupting management’s attention from our ongoing business operations 

• retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 

• managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations and 

• reconciling postacquisition costs and liabilities between buyer and seller 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and operating results furthermore acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or service areas and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities which may be unsuccessful cause us to assume unanticipated liabilities disrupt our existing businesses be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy in addition to the integration risks noted above some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include 

• we frequently compete with other firms some of which may have greater financial and other resources and a greater tolerance for risk to acquire attractive companies 

• the acquired alliance andor joint venture businesses may not perform as projected 

• the goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of our acquisitions may be incorrectly valued or may become impaired 

• we may assume unanticipated liabilities including those that were not disclosed to us or which we underestimated 

• the acquired businesses or the pursuit of other inorganic growth strategies could disrupt or compete with our existing businesses distract management result in the loss of key employees divert resources result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards controls information technology systems policies procedures and performance 

• we may finance future acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price which would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 

• we may incur significant debt in connection with acquisitions whether to finance acquisitions or by assuming debt from the businesses we acquire 

• we may not have the expertise to manage and profitably grow the businesses we acquire and we may need to rely on the retention of key personnel and other suppliers of businesses we acquire which may be difficult or impossible to accomplish 

• we may enter into merger or purchase agreements but due to reasons within or outside our control fail to complete the related transactions which could result in termination fees or other penalties that could be material cause material disruptions to our businesses and operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation 

• in order to complete a proposed acquisition we may be required to divest certain portions of our business for which we may not be able to obtain favorable pricing 

• we may be involved in litigation related to mergers or acquisitions including for matters that occurred prior to the applicable closing which may be costly to defend and may result in adverse rulings against us that could be material and 

• the integration into our businesses of the businesses and entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and regulations apply to us including subjecting us to laws and regulations that did not previously apply to us 

in addition joint ventures present risks that are different from acquisitions including selection of appropriate joint venture parties initial and ongoing governance of the joint venture joint venture compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the joint venture’s business in a manner acceptable to all the parties including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures maintaining positive relationships among the joint venture parties and the joint venture’s customers and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination 

risks related to our operations 

failure to meet customer expectations may harm our brand and reputation our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership and our operating results and cash flows 

our ability to attract and retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective quality customer service operations such as call center operations pbm functions retail pharmacy and ltc services retail mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claims processing customer case installation and online access and tools that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations either directly or through vendors as we seek to reduce general and administrative expenses we must balance the potential impact of costsaving measures on our customers and other services and performances if we misjudge the effects of such measures customers and other services may be adversely affected we depend on third parties for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operations if we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations we may have difficulty retaining or profitably growing our customer base andor membership which could adversely affect our operating results for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our thirdparty vendors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results brand and reputation 

we and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience cyber attacks we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future 

we and our vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward as examples the company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems denial of service attacks attempted malware infections account takeovers scanning activity and phishing emails attacks can originate from external criminals terrorists nation states or internal actors the company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are 

designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage the impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the company’s operations or operating results through december 31 2021 the board and its audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are regularly informed regarding the company’s information security policies practices and status 

a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to an information security incident are significant large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information following an information security incident our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and members in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized access to or dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers our members or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ private information and our customers members and other constituents to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation businesses and prospects our use and disclosure of members’ customers’ and other constituents’ sensitive information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels we would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or other vendors fail to adequately protect members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information 

our information systems are critical to the operation of our businesses we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of personal health and financial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers members and other constituents in the ordinary course of our businesses some of our information systems rely upon third party systems including cloud service providers to accomplish these tasks the use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal state and international levels and these laws rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity such as the california consumer privacy act which went into effect january 1 2020 the eu’s gdpr which began to apply across the eu during 2018 and the audit program implemented by hhs under hipaa in some cases such laws rules and regulations also apply to our vendors andor may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than us laws and regulations and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach information security incident and any other incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential customer member or other constituent information whether by us by one of our business associates or vendors or by another third party could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage could interrupt our operations and could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition 

our businesses depend on our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ members’ 

and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information there can be no assurance that additional such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing packaging or administration of drugs or other products and consuming drugs in a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide for example we are a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings relating to opioids and the sale of products containing talc our businesses involve the provision of professional services including by pharmacists physician assistants nurses and nurse practitioners which exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage available under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us from third parties may not be adequate to protect us against the financial impact of the related claims we also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall tampering or mislabeling could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor financial condition 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses operating results andor future performance 

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation andor benefits costs if we are unable to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance 

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance the succession plans we have in place and our employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent thirdparty brokers consultants and agents new distribution channels create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result of the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling our products 

our products are sold primarily through our sales personnel who frequently work with independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent brokers consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend andor market health care benefits products of our competitors accordingly we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sales personnel and thirdparty brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels this risk is heightened as we develop operate and expand our consumeroriented products and services and we expand in the health care space and our business model evolves to include a greater focus on consumers and directtoconsumer sales such as competing for sales on insurance exchanges 

new distribution channels for our products and services continue to emerge including private exchanges operated by health care consultants and technology companies these channels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their health care benefits in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplace entrants that could interfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas 

in addition there have been several investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive these investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practices which could adversely affect our ability to market our products 

failure of our businesses to effectively collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results 

to maximize our overall enterprise value our various businesses need to collaborate effectively our businesses need to be aligned in order to prioritize goals and coordinate the design of new products intended to utilize the offerings of multiple businesses including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs in addition misaligned incentives information siloes ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures for example significant financial decisions being made at an inappropriate level in our organization also could prevent us from maximizing our operating results andor achieving our financial and other projections 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses could adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches cyber attacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in us and foreign laws and regulations including privacy and information security laws and standards may cause us to incur significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

our business success and operating results depend in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing customer loyalty and subscription programs finance and other processes throughout our operations we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of confidential and sensitive data and information including personally identifiable information and protected health information that our customers members and other constituents provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 

we have many different information and other technology systems supporting our businesses including as a result of our acquisitions our businesses depend in large part on these systems to adequately price our products and services accurately establish reserves process claims and report operating results and interact with providers employer plan sponsors customers members consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices certain of our technology systems including software are older legacy systems that are less flexible less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resources to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems we must reengineer and reduce the number of these systems to meet changing consumer and vendor preferences and needs improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses we also need to develop or acquire new technology systems contract with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumeroriented and transformation products and services we are developing operating and expanding andor to meet current 

and developing industry and regulatory standards including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats if we fail to achieve these objectives our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

in addition information technology and other technology and process improvement projects including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced systems we could among other things have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimates andor establishing appropriate pricing meeting the needs of customers consumers providers members and vendors developing and expanding our consumeroriented products and services or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these vendors are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems we use if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our operating results 

both our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating results 

we and our vendors are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks including natural disasters utility and other mechanical failures acts of war or terrorism acts of civil unrest disruption of communications data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulties the occurrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect our operations we also may be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such events although we have developed procedures for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and as a result our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our businesses in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans may not be effective should any such hazards or risks occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

we would be adversely affected if we do not effectively deploy our capital  downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could adversely affect our brand and reputation businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our operations generate significant capital and we have the ability to raise additional capital the manner in which we deploy our capital including investments in our businesses our operations such as information technology and other strategic and capital projects dividends acquisitions share andor debt repurchases repayment of debt reinsurance or other capital uses impacts our financial strength claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughout our industries our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds we believe our credit ratings and 

the financial strength and claims paying ability of our principal insurance and hmo subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our health care benefits products to certain of our customers 

each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

goodwill and other intangible assets could in the future become impaired 

as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 we had 1081 billion and 1107 billion respectively of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable if indicators of impairment are present the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group undiscounted if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted 

estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate industrywide changes changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

adverse conditions in the us and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities mortgage loans alternative investments and other investments and our operating results andor our financial condition 

the global capital markets including credit markets continue to experience volatility and uncertainty as an insurer we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the us as a result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the us and to a lesser extent the international financial markets and volatility uncertainty andor disruptions in the global capital markets particularly the us credit markets and governments’ monetary policy particularly us monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our operating results andor our financial condition by 

• significantly reducing the value andor liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results andor unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders’ equity 

• keeping interest rates low on highquality shortterm or mediumterm debt securities such as we have experienced during recent years and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities 

• reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise 

• causing nonperformance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties including customers issuers of securities in our investment portfolio mortgage borrowers andor reinsurance andor derivatives counterparties 

• making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities for example if trading becomes less frequent which could lead to significant periodtoperiod changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause periodtoperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders’ equity 

• reducing our ability to issue shortterm debt securities at attractive interest rates thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating results and 

• reducing our ability to issue other securities 

although we seek within guidelines we deem appropriate to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures a failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstances our cash flows 

risks related to our relationships with manufacturers providers suppliers and vendors 

we face risks relating to the market availability pricing suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell 

our retailltc segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs our pbm business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members as a result we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers we acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers certain of our agreements with such suppliers are shortterm and cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could adversely affect our prescription drug supply and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and financial condition moreover many products distributed by our pharmacies are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in some cases we depend upon a single source of supply any such supply shortages or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade regulations could adversely affect our businesses 

our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control if our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery including as a result of supply shortages supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with providers on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networks with high quality providers 

we are seeking to enhance our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risksharing arrangements with providers providers’ willingness to enter these arrangements with us depends upon among other things our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these valuebased contracts these arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our members these arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies target new customer groups increase membership and reduce medical costs and if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative sources if such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customers may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership and our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

while we believe joint ventures accountable care organizations “acos” and other nontraditional health care provider organizational structures present opportunities for us the implementation of our joint ventures and other nontraditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

among other things joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rates that make the joint ventures economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint ventures we may not be able to achieve these objectives in one or more of our joint ventures which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

if our suppliers or service providers fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation andor regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs 

in addition to our suppliers we contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems our arrangements with suppliers and these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations including those related to human capital and climate change for example certain of our vendors have been responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members and employees which has caused us to incur additional expenses and given rise to regulatory actions and litigation against us 

these risks are particularly high in our in medicare advantage including dual eligible special needs plans medicare part d medicaid and managed medicaid plans where third parties may perform medical management and other member related services for us any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policies data security andor cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceedings prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions fines sanctions andor penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we may experience increased medical and other benefit costs litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not have contracts with us render services to our health care benefits members 

some providers that render services to our health care benefits members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with these providers as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example in october 2018 an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately 150 million in a proceeding relating to aetna’s outofnetwork benefit payment and administration practices and in march 2019 that award was reduced to approximately 86 million such disputes may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs make it difficult for us to compete in certain geographies and create new competitors 

hospitals and other providers and health systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and has the potential to improve the delivery of health care services it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies these health systems also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us a process that has been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaidonly acos developed as a result of state medicaid laws practice management companies consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other providers adopt continues to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate these changes may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs and may require us to change our operations including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses or are unable to collaborate or contract with providers on acceptable terms each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and operating results

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and its emerging new variants continue to impact the us and other countries around the world our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country has enabled us to continue to play an indispensable role in the national response to covid19 as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they need us in our cvs locations in their homes and virtually the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on the company’s operating results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 primarily in the company’s health care benefits and retailltc segments 

health care benefits segment 

beginning in midmarch 2020 the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services “utilization” that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures utilization remained below historical levels through april 2020 began to recover in may and june 2020 and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 with select geographies impacted by covid19 waves in response to covid19 the company provided expanded benefit coverage to its members including costsharing waivers for covid19 related treatments as well as assistance to members through premium credits telehealth costsharing waivers and other investments during 2020 covid19 also resulted in a shift in the company’s medical membership the company experienced declines in commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers substantially offset by increases in medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment 

during the year ended december 31 2021 overall medical costs in the first quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate however the segment experienced increased covid19 testing and treatment costs and lower medicare riskadjusted revenue during the second quarter covid19 testing and treatment costs persisted however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter beginning in the third quarter of 2021 medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of covid19 which resulted in increased testing and treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year 

retailltc segment 

during march 2020 the company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the covid19 pandemic beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year the company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and minuteclinic locations due to shelterinplace orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased longterm care prescription volume as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition the company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the company’s covid19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products during 2020 the company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its cvs pharmacy ® locations as well as in longterm care facilities at communitybased testing sites in underserved areas and through its return ready sm solution the company also began administering covid19 vaccinations in longterm care facilities during december 2020 

during the first quarter of 2021 the company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies which reflected the impact of a weak cough cold and flu season while it administered the highest quarterly volume of covid19 diagnostic tests the company began administering covid19 vaccines in its retail pharmacies during february 2021 during the second quarter the segment generated earnings from covid19 vaccines and saw improved customer traffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in cvs locations during the third and fourth quarters emerging new variants drove the continued administration of covid19 vaccinations including boosters and diagnostic testing while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of overthecounter “otc” test kits in the front store during the year ended december 31 2021 the company administered more than 32 million covid19 tests and more than 59 million covid19 vaccines and sold more than 22 million otc test kits 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve we believe covid19’s impact on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to the pandemic those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material

• decreased operating income in the health care benefits segment driven by higher covid19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the covid19 pandemic during 2020 as well as the absence of pretax income of 307 million associated with the receipt of amounts owed to the company under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “aca” risk corridor program “aca risk corridor receipt” and 

• a 431 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the ltc business in the retailltc segment recorded during the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by

income tax provision 

• the company’s effective income tax rate decreased to 242 in 2021 compared to 263 in the prior year primarily due to the repeal of the nondeductible hif for 2021 and the favorable impact of a prior year refund claim approved by the internal revenue service during the fourth quarter of 2021 the decrease was partially offset by the absence of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2020

with respect to 2022 the company believes you should consider the following important information 

• the health care benefits segment is expected to benefit from medicare and commercial membership growth partially offset by membership declines in its medicaid products the projected mbr is expected to decrease compared to 2021 reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in covid19 related medical costs while the company still expects a net negative impact from covid19 in 2022 within the health care benefits segment the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021 

• the pharmacy services segment is expected to benefit from the company’s ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing 

• the retailltc segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the company’s minimum wage investment the company expects that covid19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022 albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021 the company expects to see continued strength in front store sales including sales of otc test kits in 2022 the extent of covid19 vaccinations diagnostic testing and otc test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy the emergence of new variants government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations

• the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the us and other countries around the world the company believes covid19’s impact on its businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic as well as the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies global supply chain consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns in addition as described in the “government regulation” section of this form 10k federal state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity andor duration of the covid19 pandemic and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the company’s businesses those primary drivers are beyond the company’s knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on the company’s businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material 

the company’s current expectations described above are forwardlooking statements please see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this 10k and the “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” in this 10k for information regarding important factors that may cause the company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected andor otherwise materially affect the company 

segment analysis 

the following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in note 17 ‘‘segment reporting’’ included in item 8 of this 10k 

the company has three operating segments health care benefits pharmacy services and retailltc as well as a corporateother segment the company’s segments maintain separate financial information and the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance the codm evaluates the performance of the company’s segments based on adjusted operating income which is defined as operating income gaap measure excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items if any that neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance see the reconciliations of operating income gaap measure to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income the company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends nongaap financial measures the company discloses such as consolidated adjusted operating income should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with gaap 

the following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the company’s segments to the consolidated totals 



 

1 total revenues of the pharmacy services segment include approximately 116 billion 109 billion and 115 billion of retail copayments for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information about retail copayments 

2 intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the health care benefits segment the pharmacy services segment andor the retailltc segment intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of pharmacy services segment clients “pss members” enrolled in maintenance choice ® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the company’s retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail when this occurs both the pharmacy services and retailltc segments record the adjusted operating income on a standalone basis 

the following are reconciliations of consolidated operating income gaap measure to consolidated adjusted operating income as well as reconciliations of segment gaap operating income to segment adjusted operating income 







 

1 the company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks customer contractsrelationships covenants not to compete technology provider networks and value of business acquired definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the company’s gaap consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment although intangible assets contribute to the company’s revenue generation the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the company’s insurance products the services performed for the company’s customers or the sale of the company’s products or services additionally intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the company’s acquisition activity accordingly the company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the company’s and investors’ ability to compare the company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends intangible asset amortization excluded from the related nongaap financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the company’s gaap financial statements and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related nongaap financial measure intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related nongaap financial measure because the amortization unlike the related revenue is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised 

2 in 2021 2020 and 2019 acquisitionrelated integration costs relate to the company’s acquisition “aetna acquisition” of aetna inc “aetna” the acquisitionrelated integration costs are reflected in the company’s gaap consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the corporateother segment

4 during the year ended december 31 2021 the goodwill impairment charge relates to the ltc reporting unit within the retailltc segment 

5 in june 2021 the company received 61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020 the resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the company’s gaap consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the health care benefits segment 

6 in 2020 the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pretax gain on the sale of the workers’ compensation business which the company sold on july 31 2020 for approximately 850 million the gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the company’s gaap consolidated statement of operations within the health care benefits segment in 2019 the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pretax loss on the sale of onofre which occurred on july 1 2019 the loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the company’s gaap consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the retailltc segment 

7 in 2020 the company received 313 million owed to it under the aca’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain after considering offsetting items such as the aca’s minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” rebate requirements and premium taxes the company recognized pretax income of 307 million in the company’s gaap consolidated statement of operations within the health care benefits segment

commentary  2021 compared to 2020 

revenues 

• total revenues increased 67 billion or 89 to 822 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by growth in the government services business partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of the hif for 2021 and the absence of the aca risk corridor receipt

significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment andor complexity and thus are considered to be critical accounting policies the company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board the “audit committee” and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them 

revenue recognition 

health care benefits segment 

health care benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers revenue is recognized based on customer billings which in the company’s commercial business reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the company’s records at the time the billings are prepared billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month revenue related to the company’s government business is collected monthly from the us federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility 

the company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors these adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments in each period the company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly as information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known the company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise a significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the company’s operating results 

premium revenue 

premiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts additionally premium revenue subject to the mlr rebate requirements of the aca is recorded net of the estimated minimum mlr rebates for the current calendar year premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods unearned premiums are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned 

some of the company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of insured members such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract 

services revenue 

services revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations the health care benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of asc fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for asc members asc fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided some of the company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions such as customer service response time claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range with any of these guarantees the company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the company by the customer involved each period the company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues 

accounting for medicare part d 

revenues include insurance premiums earned by the company’s pdps which are determined based on the pdp’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms the insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium which is the responsibility of the pdp member and can be subsidized by cms in the case of lowincome members and a direct premium paid by cms premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 

revenues also include a risksharing feature of the medicare part d program design referred to as the risk corridor the company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to or receivable from cms under the risk corridor and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to cms at the end of the reporting year 

in addition to medicare part d premiums the company receives additional payments each month from cms related to catastrophic reinsurance lowincome costsharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits if the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable net or accrued expenses 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the company’s retail pharmacy network the company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time pbm services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs 

the company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members the company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related pbm services 

revenues include i the portion of the price the client pays directly to the company net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client see “drug discounts” and “guarantees” below ii the price paid to the company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions “retail copayments” and iii claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts sales taxes are not included in revenues 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs the company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the pharmacy services segment 

• revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member at the time of delivery the company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments 

• revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the company’s pointofsale which is when the claim is adjudicated by the company’s online claims processing system and the company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations 

for contracts under which the company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member revenue is recognized using the net method 

drug discounts 

the company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brandname formulary drugs the company estimates these rebates at periodend based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients the estimates are based on the best available data at periodend and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client the company adjusts its rebates 

payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

guarantees 

the company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

retailltc segment 

retail pharmacy 

the company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise for pharmacy sales each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined valuebased service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

revenue from company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers ie breakage are recognized based on historical redemption patterns 

customer returns are not material to the company’s operating results or financial condition sales taxes are not included in revenues 

loyalty and other programs 

the company’s customer loyalty program extracare ®  consists of two components extrasavings tm and extrabucks ® rewards extrasavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level 

extrabucks rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels thus the company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction the company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the extrabucks rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards revenue allocated to extrabucks rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed at the end of each period unredeemed extrabucks rewards are reflected as a contract liability 

the company also offers a subscriptionbased membership program carepass ®  under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the company delivering the goods and services revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied 

longterm care 

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the company separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements a significant portion of longterm care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal medicare part d program and to a lesser extent state medicaid programs the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources as well as longterm care facilities and other third party insurance payors and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts accordingly the total revenues and receivables reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors 

patient copayments associated with medicare part d certain state medicaid programs medicare part b and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures 

walkin medical clinics 

for services provided by the company’s walkin medical clinics revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates 

impairments of debt securities 

the company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company bifurcates the impairment into creditrelated and noncredit related components the amount of the creditrelated component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income and the amount of the noncredit related component is included in other comprehensive income the company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

in evaluating whether a credit related loss exists the company considers a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security an industry or geographic area the payment structure of the security the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 

during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the company recorded yieldrelated impairment losses on debt securities of 42 million and 49 million respectively during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the company did not record creditrelated impairment losses on debt securities during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded otherthantemporary impairment “otti” losses on debt securities of 24 million 

the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the company’s assessment may change with the passage of time unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods 

vendor allowances and purchase discounts 

vendor and manufacturer receivables were 106 billion and 98 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased contractual arrangements with vendors including manufacturers wholesalers and retail pharmacies normally provide for the pharmacy services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one or a combination of the following forms i a direct discount at the time of purchase ii a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or iii when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy a discount or rebate paid subsequent to dispensing these rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter historically the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition the company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed the pharmacy services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes in addition the pharmacy services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 

retailltc segment 

vendor allowances received by the retailltc segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs andor other services provided amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense included in operating expenses when the related advertising commitment is satisfied any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straightline basis over the life of the related contract 

the company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data the majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter historically adjustments to the company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

there have not been any material changes in the way the company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years 

inventory 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method 

the value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and ltc pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated the company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts when estimating these losses a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a locationbylocation basis and current physical inventory loss trends 

the total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was 522 million and 369 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses it is possible that actual results could differ in order to help investors assess the aggregate risk if any associated with the inventoryrelated uncertainties discussed above a ten percent 10 pretax change in estimated inventory losses which is a reasonably likely change would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately 52 million as of december 31 2021 

although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 

rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments as the interest rate implicit in the company’s leases is not readily determinable the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate determined by class of underlying asset to discount the lease payments the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives the company evaluates the recoverability of its rightofuse assets as described in “longlived asset impairment” below 

the company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each for real estate leases the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and 

regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy generally the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the rightofuse asset and lease liability similarly renewal options are not included in the lease term for nonreal estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets and lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the shortterm lease 

for real estate leases the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

longlived asset impairment 

recoverability of definitelived assets 

the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets excluding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the company groups and evaluates these longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified if indicators of impairment are present the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group undiscounted if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted if required an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted 

the longlived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales profitability and cash flows when preparing these estimates the company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales profitability and cash flow results and forecasts these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs andor increased member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers as part of this review the company evaluated changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business in connection with this initiative on november 17 2021 the board of directors of cvs health corporation the “board” authorized the closing of approximately 900 stores over the next three years the company expects to close approximately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024 as a result management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’ asset groups including the associated operating lease rightofuse assets and property and equipment a longlived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups were lower than their respective carrying values accordingly in the three months ended december 31 2021 the company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately 14 billion consisting of a write down of approximately 11 billion related to operating lease rightofuse assets and 261 million related to property and equipment within the retailltc segment 

there were no material impairment charges recognized on longlived assets in the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded store impairment charges of 231 million primarily related to operating lease rightofuse asset impairment charges 

recoverability of goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value or carrying amount including goodwill the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the net book value carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates these assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes discount rates terminal growth rates and forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization income taxes capital expenditures and future working capital requirements when determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates the company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends consolidated revenues profitability and cash flow results and forecasts and industry trends the company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions the riskfree interest rate environment the company’s market capitalization efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs including their prescription drug costs andor increase member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share consumer spending patterns and the company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives 

2021 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2021 the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill the results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the ltc reporting unit as the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date the results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins with the exception of the commercial business reporting unit which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3 

as discussed in note 5 ‘‘goodwill and other intangibles’’ included in item 8 of this 10k during 2021 the ltc reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the company’s ability to grow the ltc reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed these challenges include lower net facility admissions net longterm care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the emerging new variants which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the company’s longterm care facility customers than previously anticipated during the third quarter of 2021 ltc management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their longterm plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond the company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test which indicated that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in a 431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021 the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021 there is no remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit 

the company has experienced declines in its commercial insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the aetna acquisition and may continue to do so for a number of reasons including as a result of the competitive commercial business environment in addition covid19 and the emerging new variants have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on medical membership in the commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers including due to business failures as well as reduced willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers the company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership revenue growth rate operating income and the discount rate although the company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2021 were reasonable and achievable the challenges described above may affect the company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the commercial business reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so as of december 31 2021 the goodwill balance in the commercial business reporting unit was 265 billion 

2020 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6 and 12 respectively 

2019 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4 and 9 respectively 

recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset the company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions availability of market information and the profitability of the company there were no impairment losses recognized on indefinitelived intangible assets in any of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 or 2019 

health care costs payable 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 75 and 77 respectively of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of i services rendered to the company’s insured members but not yet reported to the company and ii claims which have been reported to the company but not yet paid collectively “ibnr” health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements the remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments the company develops its estimate of ibnr using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information on the company’s reserving methodology 

during 2021 and 2020 the company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end after considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 21 and 4 basis points higher respectively than previously estimated resulting in a decrease of 207 million and 35 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively in health care costs payable that related to the prior year the company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of ibnr as of december 31 2021 however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 13 basis points from the company’s assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus 186 million pretax 

also during 2021 and 2020 the company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated specifically after considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed health care costs that were 50 and 40 lower respectively for each fourth quarter than previously estimated resulting in a reduction of 581 million and 394 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively in health care costs payable that related to prior year 

management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates when establishing reserves as of december 31 2021 the company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 18 from health care cost trend rates recently observed health care cost trend rates during the past two years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the covid19 pandemic the impact has not been uniform with products and select geographies experiencing utilization impacts due to covid19 waves based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 35 from the assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus 450 million pretax 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse such adjustments are recorded in the period 

in which changes in tax laws are enacted regardless of when they are effective deferred tax assets are reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain additionally the company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority interest andor penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions the company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals as warranted due to changing facts and circumstances

evaluation of interest rate and credit quality risk 

the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate the company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio in connection with its investment and risk management objectives the company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by among other things levels of or changes in interest rates shortterm or longterm duration prepayment rates equity markets or credit ratingsspreads the company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps treasury rate locks forward contracts futures contracts warrants put options and credit default swaps these instruments viewed separately subject the company to varying degrees of interest rate equity price and credit risk however when used for hedging the company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk 

investments 

the company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at december 31 2021 and 2020

evaluation of market valuation risks 

the company regularly evaluates its risk from marketsensitive instruments by examining among other things levels of or changes in interest rates shortterm or longterm duration prepayment rates equity markets andor credit ratingsspreads the company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to managementapproved investment guidelines and operates within those guidelines and the business objectives of its portfolios 

on a quarterly basis the company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the company’s consolidated nearterm financial condition operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in nearterm market rates and prices interest rate changes whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors represent the most material risk exposure category for the company the company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios the assumptions used were as follows an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates which the company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario for longterm debt issued by the company as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15 in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the company’s investment portfolio 

assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at december 31 2021 is as follows 

• the fair value of longterm debt issued by the company would decline by approximately 46 billion 58 billion pretax changes in the fair value of longterm debt do not impact the company’s operating results or financial condition 

• the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately 680 million 860 million pretax related to continuing nonexperiencerated products reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity as the company classifies these debt securities as available for sale the company does not record liabilities at fair value 

if the value of the company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15 this would result in a net decline in fair value of 14 million 18 million pretax 

based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk the company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated nearterm financial condition operating results or cash flows as of december 31 2021

the laws and rules governing the company’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the company’s businesses creates areas of uncertainty further there are numerous proposed health care financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal state and international levels some of which could adversely affect the company’s businesses if they are enacted the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings including fundamental changes to the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which it competes such as the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring the commercial medicare or medicaid marketplace or reducing payments to the company under or financing for medicare medicaid dual eligible or special needs programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation or changing the laws governing pbms will change various aspects of the industries in which it competes or the health care industry generally or the impact those changes will have on the company’s businesses operating results cash flows andor stock price but the effects could be materially adverse the company has internal control policies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to deter prohibited practices however if the company’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations it may face investigations prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties administrative remedies and criminal sanctions any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations summarized below or any adverse applications or interpretations of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting the company andor its businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results financial condition cash flows andor stock price see item 3 of this 10k “legal proceedings” for further information 

the company can give no assurance that its businesses financial condition operating results andor cash flows will not be materially adversely affected or that the company will not be required to materially change its business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to one or more of the company’s businesses one or more of the industries in which the company competes andor the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of one or more of the company’s

laws and regulations related to covid19 

the families first coronavirus response act the “families first act” and the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” were enacted in march 2020 each of the families first act and the cares act requires the company to provide coverage for covid19 related medical services in many cases without member costsharing in its insured health care benefits products 

the cares act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing preparing for andor responding to covid19 provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to covid19 under the cares act the company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with covid19 testing and vaccination as well as monoclonal antibody treatment aside from such reimbursement the company did not request any funding under the cares act however in the second quarter of 2020 the company received 43 million from the cares act provider relief fund all of which was returned to the us department of health and human services “hhs” during the second quarter of 2020 

the cares act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of social security taxes effective march 27 2020 the company has elected to defer its social security tax payments in accordance with this provision and will remit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about december 31 2021 and december 31 2022 as required under the cares act the company deferred approximately 670 million of its social security tax payments during the year ended december 31 2020 

in addition to the families first act and the cares act the company is experiencing an unprecedented level of new laws regulations directives and orders from federal state county and municipal authorities related to the covid19 pandemic most of which have been issued on an emergency basis with immediate or in some instances retroactive effect these governmental actions include but are not limited to requirements to waive member costsharing associated with covid19 testing and treatment provide coverage for additional covid19related services expand the use of telemedicine suspend precertification or other um mechanisms including review of claims for medical necessity allow earlier or longer renewal of prescriptions extend grace periods for payments of premiums or limit coverage termination based on nonpayment of premiums or fees modify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain employee eligibility and facilitate accelerate or advance payments to providers for example in december 2020 as part of a covid19 relief package congress enacted a 375 payment increase to providers through the medicare physician fee schedule which medicare advantage plans often use as a benchmark for provider contracts as a result in many instances the company will be contractually required to pass on this payment to its providers which was not anticipated at the time of bidding 

related governmental actions have required the company to close or significantly limit operations at traditional office worksites and affected the hours of operation of minuteclinic locations and the company’s pharmacies in some instances the company has taken permitted proactive actions consistent with more general regulatory directives such as expanding home delivery of prescription medications extending hours of operation for member assistance lines and liberalizing certain other terms of coverage similar directives have affected the company’s international operations the company anticipates additional mandates and directives from domestic and foreign federal state county and local authorities throughout the continuation of the covid19 pandemic and for some time thereafter some of which may result in permanent changes in the company’s operations or the health care and other benefits cost and other risks assumed by the company further although the company has seen regulators relax certain requirements in light of the covid19 pandemic such as temporary suspension of certain audits and extensions of certain filing deadlines failure to provide regulatory relief or accommodations in other areas may result in increased costs or reduced revenue for the company 

the impact of this governmental activity on the us economy consumer customer and health care provider behavior and health care utilization patterns is beyond our knowledge and control as a result the financial andor operational impact these covid19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the collective impact could be material and adverse 

laws and regulations related to multiple segments of the company’s business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs  the company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims and other information to medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute the “aks” state false claims acts and antikickback statutes in most states the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the false claims act prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs in addition any claim for government reimbursement also violates the false claims act where it results from a violation of the aks 

both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government participants in the health and related benefits industry including the company frequently are subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

the aca  the united states supreme court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the aca by june 2021 if the aca is deemed unconstitutional there will likely be significant changes to the laws and rules that govern the company’s businesses if the aca is deemed constitutional there may nevertheless be continued efforts to invalidate modify repeal or replace it or portions of it and the company expects aspects of the aca to continue to significantly impact its business operations and operating results including pricing medical benefit ratios “mbrs” and the geographies in which the company’s products are available 

the aca made broadbased changes to the us health care system while most of the significant aspects of the aca became effective during or prior to 2014 parts of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive orders legislation regulations and guidance as well as ongoing litigation additional changes to the aca and those regulations and guidance at the federal andor state level are likely and those changes are likely to be significant growing federal and state budgetary pressures make it more likely that any changes including changes at the state level in response to changes to or invalidation repeal or replacement of the aca andor changes in the funding levels andor payment mechanisms of federally supported benefit programs will be adverse to us for example if any elements of the aca are invalidated or repealed at the federal level the company expects that some states would seek to enact similar requirements such as prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage requiring coverage for dependents up to age 26 requiring guaranteed renewability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limits on insurance coverage 

the company filed a lawsuit in august 2019 to recover the 313 million it was owed under the aca’s risk corridor program which had been stayed pending the supreme court decision in april 2020 the us supreme court ruled that health insurance companies may sue the federal government for amounts owed as calculated under the aca’s temporary risk corridor program in october 2020 the company received the 313 million in funds it was owed under the aca’s risk corridor program 

the expansion of health care coverage contemplated by the aca is being funded in part by reductions to the reimbursements the company and other health plans are paid by the federal government for medicare members among other sources while not allinclusive the following are some of the recent key funding changes related to the aca assuming it continues to be implemented in its current form the company continues to evaluate these provisions and the related regulations and regulatory guidance to determine the impact that they will have on its business operations and operating results 

• the repeal of the annual nontax deductible industrywide hif for calendar years after 2020 the hif was 155 billion and 143 billion for 2020 and 2018 respectively and suspended for 2019 

• the repeal of the nontax deductible 40 excise tax on employersponsored health care benefits above a certain threshold that was scheduled to begin in 2022 

• reduced federal matching funds for medicaid expansion starting in 2017 the federal matching rate declined slightly each year until it reached 90 percent in 2020 and will remain there 

the aca also specifies minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for commercial and medicare insured products specifies features required to be included in commercial benefit designs limits commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new participants to enter the marketplace and significantly increases federal and state oversight of health plans including regulations and processes that could delay or limit the company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates this in turn could adversely affect the company’s ability to continue to participate in certain product lines andor geographies that it serves today 

potential repeal of the aca ongoing legislative regulatory and administrative policy changes to the aca the results of federal and state level elections pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of the aca or funding for the law and federal budget negotiations continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the aca given the inherent difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future changes to the aca and how states businesses and individuals will respond to those changes the company cannot predict the impact on it of future changes to the aca it is reasonably possible that invalidation repeal or replacement of or other changes to the aca andor states’ responses to such changes in the aggregate could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s businesses operating results and cash flows 

medicare regulation  the company’s medicare advantage products compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage products offered by other medicare advantage organizations and medicare supplement products offered by other insurers the company’s medicare pdp and medicare supplement products are products that medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage 

the company continues to expand the number of counties in which it offers medicare products the company has expanded its medicare service area and products in 2021 and is seeking to substantially grow its medicare membership revenue and operating results over the next several years including through growth in medicare supplement products the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare products offered and the medicarerelated provisions of the aca significantly increase the company’s exposure to funding and regulation of and changes in government policy with respect to andor funding or regulation of the various medicare programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs andor new reforms or surcharges on existing programs for example the aca requires minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans of 85 if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms due to potential lower utilization of medical services by medicare beneficiaries during the covid19 pandemic it is possible certain medicare advantage contracts may not meet the 85 mlr for consecutive years 

the company’s medicare advantage and pdp products are heavily regulated by cms the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other private participants in medicare programs are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example in the second quarter of 2014 cms issued a final rule implementing the aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation payments the company receives from cms for its medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the us department of justice the “doj” the office of the inspector general of the hhs the “oig” and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the amount of the company’s medicare reimbursement require the company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit the company’s and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare standards and its medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms may seek premium and other refunds prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to passively enroll members in one or more of the company’s medicare or medicaremedicaid demonstration historically known as “dual eligible” plans exclude us from participating in one or more medicare dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms regulations or its medicare contractual requirements the company’s medicare supplement products are regulated at the state level and subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks 

cms regularly audits the company’s performance to determine its compliance with cms’s regulations and its contracts with cms and to assess the quality of services it provides to medicare advantage and pdp beneficiaries for example cms conducts risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits of a subset of medicare advantage contracts for each contract year 

since 2013 cms has selected certain of the company’s medicare advantage contracts for various years for radv audit and the number of radv audits continues to increase the oig also is auditing the company’s risk adjustment data and that of other companies and the company expects cms and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data the company also has received civil investigative demands “cids” from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of its patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program 

on october 26 2018 cms issued proposed rules related to among other things changes to the radv audit methodology established by cms in 2012 cms projects that the changes to the radv audit methodology would increase its recoveries from medicare advantage plans as a result of radv audits cms has requested comments on the proposed rules including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audits of medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward the company is evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on the company’s operating results financial condition and cash flows if the proposed radv rule change were adopted as proposed cms also has announced that its goal is to subject all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year 

a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings” the star rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by cms including quality of preventative services chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of four or more stars out of five stars are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates as a result the company’s medicare advantage plans’ operating results in 2021 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings the company’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its medicare operations cms released the company’s 2021 star ratings in october 2020 the company’s 2021 star ratings will be used to determine which of its medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2022 based on the company’s membership at december 31 2020 83 of the company’s medicare advantage members were in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 40 stars cms also gives pdps star ratings which affect each pdp’s enrollment medicare advantage and pdp plans that are rated less than three stars for three consecutive years are subject to contract termination by cms cms continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve four stars or more despite the company’s success in achieving high 2021 star ratings and other quality measures and the continuation of its improvement efforts there can be no assurances that it will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years accordingly the company’s medicare advantage plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

overall the company projects the benchmark payment rates in cms’s april 2020 final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rates for 2021 will increase funding for the company’s medicare advantage business excluding the impact of the hif in 2020 by approximately 18 in 2021 compared to 2020 this 2021 rate increase only partially offsets the challenge the company faces from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications and cms local and national coverage decisions that require the company to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into the company’s bids the federal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for medicare advantage andor pdp plans or otherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products the company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the company’s continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp programs although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change in january 2021 cms issued its final notice detailing final 2022 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates final 2022 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 41 

going forward the company expects cms the oig the doj other federal agencies and the us congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdps demonstration projects such as medicaremedicaid plans and provider network access and adequacy modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles it is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity any of which could materially and adversely affect the company 

in addition in november 2020 the hhs released the final rebate rule the “rebate rule” which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the aks for rebates from pharmaceutical companies to pbms in medicare part d replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patients with high outofpocket costs and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbors are i for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and ii for flat service fee payments made to pbms which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs the pharmaceutical care 

management association the “pcma” which represents pbms has filed a suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premiums in medicare part d and was adopted in an unlawful manner it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced and what the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company 

340b drug pricing program – the 340b drug pricing program allows eligible covered entities to purchase prescription drugs from manufacturers at a steep discount and is overseen by the hhs and the health resources and services administration “hrsa” in 2020 a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers began programs that limited covered entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements which the company has with some covered entities enforcement from hhs and hrsa to curb these manufacturer practices will significantly impact the company’s participation in the program in the future 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs companies involved in public health care programs such as medicare andor medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud waste and abuse and are often the subject of fraud waste and abuse investigations and audits the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare and medicaid program standards ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the company’s compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources 

antitrust and unfair competition  the us federal trade commission “ftc” investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand name drug pricing and rebate practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that the company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy cvs specialty or minuteclinic plays a unique or expanded role in a pharmacy services or health care benefits segment product offering the company’s business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state andor federal regulators andor private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of the company’s activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by the company of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii the company uses and discloses deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use andor disclosure of pii 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” as further modified by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” further arra requires the company and other covered entities to report any breaches of phi to impacted individuals and to the hhs and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to phi criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of arra amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi the hitech act also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates hhs has begun to audit health plans providers and other parties to enforce hipaa compliance including with respect to data security 

in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa including laws that place stricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and 

requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access to phi states also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the financial modernization act of 1999 also known as the grammleachbliley act “glba” which generally require insurers including health insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a nonaffiliated third party like hipaa glba sets a “floor” standard allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the company has made to comply with hipaa and glba 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry in addition states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access deletion protection or transparency such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” states also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity such as the regulations issued by the new york department of financial services complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations which may differ from state to state requires significant resources in addition differing approaches to state privacy andor cybersecurity regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines widelyreported large scale commercial data breaches in the united states and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states these legislative and regulatory developments will impact the design and operation of the company’s businesses its privacy and security strategy and its webbased and mobile assets 

finally each public exchange is required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the public exchange has implemented for itself or nonpublic exchange entities which include insurers offering plans through the public exchange and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws  the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the federal trade commission act the federal postal service act and the consumer product safety act most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription programs in addition the federal government and most states have adopted laws andor regulations requiring places of public accommodation health care services and other goods and services to be accessible to people with disabilities these consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care products and services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities as a result of the company’s directtoconsumer activities including mobile and webbased solutions offered to members and to other consumers the company also is subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations for example the ccpa became effective in 2020 and additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection may be proposed or enacted in 2020 the company expects these new laws and regulations to impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliance costs 

transparency in coverage rule  in october 2020 the hhs released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose negotiated prices of drugs medical services supplies and other covered items to the public the rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose costsharing information upon request to a participant beneficiary or enrollee which unless otherwise indicated for the purpose of the final rules includes an authorized representative and require plans and issuers to disclose innetwork provider rates historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and the associated billed charges and negotiated rates for prescription drugs disclosure of data in a machine readable file is required beginning in january 2022 and insurers are required to have a consumer tool in place by january 2023 the public disclosure of insurer or pbmnegotiated price concessions may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act and the telemarketing sales rule give the ftc the federal communications commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions

state insurance hmo and insurance holding company regulation  a number of states regulate affiliated groups of insurers and hmos such as the company under holding company statutes these laws may among other things require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany transfers of assets and transactions between the regulated companies and their affiliates including their parent holding companies the company expects the states in which its insurance and hmo subsidiaries are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control activities of its insurance companies and hmos changes to state insurance hmo andor insurance holding company laws or regulations or changes to the interpretation of those laws or regulations including due to regulators’ increasing concerns regarding insurance company andor hmo solvency due among other things to past and expected payor insolvencies could negatively affect the company’s businesses in various ways including through increases in solvency fund assessments requirements that the company hold greater levels of capital andor delays in approving dividends from regulated subsidiaries 

pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

the states of domicile of the company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory riskbased capital “rbc” requirements for health and other insurance companies and hmos based on the national association of insurance commissioners’ riskbased capital for insurers model act the “rbc model act” these rbc requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and hmos taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products the rbc model act sets forth the formula for calculating rbc requirements which are designed to take into account asset risks insurance risks interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business in general under these laws an insurance company or hmo must submit a report of its rbc level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year at december 31 2020 the rbc level of each of the company’s insurance and hmo subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general the company assists plan sponsors in the administration of their health benefit plans including the prescription drug benefit portion of those plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors in addition the company may have fiduciary duties where it has specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

some of the company’s health and related benefits and large case pensions products and services and related fees also are subject to potential issues raised by judicial interpretations relating to erisa under those interpretations together with us department of labor “dol” regulations the company may have erisa fiduciary duties with respect to pbm members andor certain general account assets held under contracts that are not guaranteed benefit policies as a result certain transactions related to those general account assets are subject to conflict of interest and other restrictions and the company must provide certain disclosures to policyholders annually the company must comply with these restrictions or face substantial penalties 

in addition erisa generally preempts all state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans but the extent of the preemption continues to be reviewed by courts including the us supreme court for example in december 2020 the us supreme court upheld an arkansas law that among other things mandates a particular pricing methodology establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate prohibits a pbm from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost 

other legislative initiatives and regulatory initiatives  the us federal and state governments as well as governments in other countries where the company does business continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and the company’s businesses operating results andor cash flows for example 

• under the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 significant automatic acrosstheboard budget cuts known as sequestration began in march 2013 including medicare spending cuts of not more than 2 of total program costs per year through 2024 since then congress has extended and modified sequestration a number of times currently the cares act suspended medicare sequestration from may 2020 to the end of december 2020 and extended mandatory sequestration to 2030 the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 extended the temporary suspension of medicare sequestration through the end of march 2021 significant uncertainty remains as to whether and how the us congress will proceed with actions that create additional federal revenue andor with entitlement reform the company cannot predict future federal medicare or federal or state medicaid funding levels or the impact that future federal or state budget actions or entitlement program reform if it occurs will have on the company’s businesses operations or operating results but the effects could be materially adverse particularly on the company’s medicare andor medicaid revenues mbrs and operating results 

• the european union’s “eu’s” general data protection regulation “gdpr” began to apply across the eu during 2018 

• other significant legislative andor regulatory measures which are or recently have been under consideration include the following 

• eliminating payment of manufacturer’s rebates on prescription drugs to pbms pdps and managed medicaid organizations in connection with federally funded health care programs 

• imposing requirements and restrictions on the design andor administration of pharmacy benefit plans offered by the company’s and its clients’ health plans andor its pbm clients andor the services the company provides to those clients including prohibiting “differential” or “spread” pricing in pbm contracts restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs restricting the company’s ability to require members to obtain drugs through a home delivery or specialty pharmacy restricting the company’s ability to place certain specialty or other drugs in the higher cost tiers of its pharmacy formularies restricting the company’s ability to make changes to drug formularies andor clinical programs limiting or eliminating rebates on pharmaceuticals requiring the use of up front purchase price discounts on pharmaceuticals in lieu of rebates restricting the company’s ability to configure its health plan and retail pharmacy provider networks including use of cvs pharmacy locations and restricting or eliminating the use of certain drug pricing methodologies 

• increasing federal or state government regulation of or involvement in the pricing andor purchasing of drugs 

• restricting the company’s ability to limit providers’ participation in its networks andor remove providers from its networks by imposing network adequacy requirements or otherwise including in its medicare and commercial health care benefits products 

• imposing assessments on or to be collected by health plans or health carriers that may or may not be passed through to their customers these assessments may include assessments for insolvency the uninsured uncompensated care medicaid funding or defraying health care provider medical malpractice insurance costs 

• mandating coverage by the company’s and its clients’ health plans for additional conditions andor specified procedures drugs or devices eg high cost pharmaceuticals experimental pharmaceuticals and oral chemotherapy regimens 

• regulating electronic connectivity 

• mandating or regulating the disclosure of provider fee schedules manufacturer’s rebates and other data about the company’s payments to providers andor payments the company receives from pharmaceutical manufacturers 

• mandating or regulating disclosure of provider outcome andor efficiency information

• assessing the medical device status of hit products andor solutions mobile consumer wellness tools and clinical decision support tools which may require compliance with fda requirements in relation to some of these products solutions andor tools 

• restricting the ability of employers andor health plans to establish or impose member financial responsibility 

• amending or supplementing erisa to impose greater requirements on pbms or the administration of employerfunded benefit plans or limit the scope of current erisa preemption which would among other things expose the company and other health plans to expanded liability for punitive and other extracontractual damages and additional state regulation 

it is uncertain whether the company can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation on its operating results or cash flows including whether it can recoup through higher premium rates expanded membership or other measures the increased costs of mandated coverage or benefits assessments fees taxes or other increased costs including the cost of modifying its systems to implement any enacted legislation or regulations 

the company’s businesses also may be affected by other legislation and regulations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act creates incentives for whistleblowers to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” there also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states 

health savings accounts health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax fee and subsidy provisions of the aca also are regulated by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service 

the company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability federal and state courts including the us supreme court continue to consider cases and federal and state regulators continue to issue regulations and interpretations addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims the scope of erisa’s fiduciary duty requirements the scope of the false claims act and the preemptive effect of erisa on state laws 

contract audits  the company is subject to audits of many of its contracts including its pbm client contracts its pbm rebate contracts its pbm network contracts its contracts relating to medicare advantage andor medicare part d the agreements the company’s pharmacies enter into with other payors its medicaid contracts and its customer contracts because some of the company’s contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

federal employee health benefits program  the company’s subsidiaries contract with the office of personnel management the “opm” to provide managed health care services under the fehb program in their service areas these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program opm regulations require that communityrated fehb plans meet a fehb programspecific minimum mlr by plan code and market managing to these rules is complicated by the simultaneous application of the minimum mlr standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the aca the company also has a contractual arrangement with carriers for the fehb program such as the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the fehb act and as part of the fehb program additionally the company manages certain fehb plans on a “costplus” basis these arrangements subject the company to certain aspects of the fehb act and other federal regulations such as the fehb acquisition regulation that otherwise would not be applicable to the company the opm also is auditing the company and its other contractors to among other things verify that plans meet their applicable fehb programspecific mlr and the premiums established under the opm’s insured contracts and costs allocated pursuant to the opm’s costbased contracts are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable fehb program the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against the company if it fails to comply with the fehb program requirements 

clinical services regulation  the company provides clinical services to health plans pbms and providers for a variety of complex and common medical conditions including arranging for certain members to participate in disease management programs state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy the practice of nursing and certain other clinical activities clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of clinical services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice 

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as ppos tpas and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs 

international regulation  the company has insurance licenses in several foreign jurisdictions and does business directly or through local affiliations in numerous countries around the world the company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the european economic area following the united kingdom’s exit from the eu “brexit” however the impact of brexit on the company’s international business and operating results is uncertain 

the company’s international operations are subject to different and sometimes more stringent legal and regulatory requirements which vary widely by jurisdiction including anticorruption laws economic sanctions laws various privacy insurance tax tariff and trade laws and regulations corporate governance privacy data protection including the eu’s general data protection regulation which began to apply across the eu during 2018 data mining data transfer labor and employment intellectual property consumer protection and investment laws and regulations discriminatory licensing procedures compulsory cessions of reinsurance required localization of records and funds higher premium and income taxes limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership in addition the expansion of the company’s operations into foreign countries increases the company’s exposure to the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering provisions of us law including the fcpa and corresponding foreign laws including the uk bribery act 2010 the “uk bribery act” 

anticorruption laws  the fcpa prohibits offering promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage the company also is subject to applicable anticorruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates in many countries outside the united states health care professionals are employed by the government therefore the company’s dealings with them are subject to regulation under the fcpa violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and there continues to be a heightened level of fcpa enforcement activity by the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the doj the uk bribery act is an anticorruption law that is broader in scope than the fcpa and applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with the uk authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions 

antimoney laundering regulations  certain lines of the company’s businesses are subject to treasury antimoney laundering regulations those lines of business have implemented antimoney laundering policies designed to ensure their compliance with the regulations the company also is subject to antimoney laundering laws in nonus jurisdictions where it operates 

office of foreign assets control  the company also is subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of treasury “ofac” ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes terrorists international narcotics traffickers those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states in addition the company is subject to similar regulations in the nonus jurisdictions in which it operates 

fda regulation  the fda regulates the company’s compounding pharmacy and clinical research operations the fda also generally has authority to among other things regulate the manufacture distribution sale and labeling of medical devices including hemodialysis devices such as the device the company is developing and mobile medical devices and many products sold through retail pharmacies including prescription drugs overthecounter medications cosmetics dietary supplements and certain food items in addition the fda regulates the company’s activities as a distributor of store brand products 

laws and regulations related to the pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation  legislation andor regulations seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect and the company’s ability to standardize its pbm products and services across state lines in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” and the national council of insurance legislators have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact the company’s health plan clients andor the services provided to those clients andor the company’s health plans 

the company’s pbm activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels including being subject to the false claims act and state false claims acts and the aks and state antikickback laws these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern andor further restrict critical pbm practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers use of administration of andor changes to drug formularies maximum allowable cost “mac” list pricing average wholesale prices “awp” andor clinical programs the offering to plan sponsors of pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread” ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pbm and the price paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider disclosure of data to third parties drug um practices the level of duty a pbm owes its customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of the company’s pharmacies including audits of its pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to members’ drug utilization and registration or licensing of pbms failure by the 

company or one of its pbm services suppliers to comply with these laws or regulations could result in material fines andor sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results andor cash flows 

the company’s pbm service contracts including those in which the company assumes certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of pbm activities due to legislation passing in a number of states requiring pbms to register or obtain a license with the department rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements pharmacy reimbursement for generics mac reimbursement and pharmacy audits  most of which fall under the state insurance code 

mostfavorednations rule  in november 2020 hhs released the mostfavorednations rule the “mfn rule” which requires cms to take a mostfavorednation approach in calculating payment for medicare part b drugs the mfn rule will test paying part b drugs at comparable amounts to the lowest adjusted price paid by any country in the organization for economic cooperation and development that has a gross domestic product “gdp” per capita that is at least 60 of the us gdp per capita the mfn rule will also test a redesign of the percentage addon payment structure under medicare part b to remove incentives for use of highercost drugs through a flat perdose addon payment and will include a financial hardship exemption for participants the mandatory mfn rule will operate for seven years from january 1 2021 to december 31 2027 over the course of the model cms will monitor and evaluate the impact of the mfn rule on beneficiary access to drugs program costs and the quality of care for beneficiaries further cms commits to assess initial impacts of the mfn rule on quality of care including access to drugs prior to beginning performance year 5 multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers have sued hhs over the rule and it is currently delayed due to a temporary restraining order prohibiting cms from implementing it if implemented the mfn rule may impact the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers 

pharmacy network access legislation  medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s and its health plans’ and its health plan clients’ ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers for example certain “any willing provider” legislation may require the company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s ability and the company’s and its client health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the company for payment these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the company identifies through pharmacy audits 

pharmacy pricing legislation  a number of states have passed legislation regulating the company’s ability to manage and establish macs for generic prescription drugs mac methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors including cms to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay for at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

formulary and plan design regulation  a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under the aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state public exchanges additionally the naic and health care accreditation agencies like ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect the company’s ability to develop and administer formularies pharmacy networks and other plan design features on behalf of its insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

laws and regulations related to the retailltc segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its retailltc segment specifically among these are the following 

retail medical clinics  states regulate retail medical clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight clinic and lab licensure requirements and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail medical clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of the company’s owned and managed retail medical clinics 

other laws  other federal state and local laws and regulations also impact the company’s retail operations including laws and regulations governing the practice of optometry the practice of audiology the provision of dietician services and the sale of durable medical equipment contact lenses eyeglasses hearing aids and alcohol 

laws and regulations related to the health care benefits segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state local and international statutes and regulations governing its health care benefits segment specifically 

overview  differing approaches to state insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its health care benefits products and services across state lines these laws and regulations including the aca restrict how the company conducts its business and result in additional burdens and costs to the company significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies underwriting rules and procedures required benefits sales and marketing activities provider rates of payment restrictions on health plans’ ability to limit providers’ participation in their networks andor remove providers from their networks and financial condition including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements these laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product 

each health insurer and hmo must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business in addition health insurers and hmos are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal applicable laws also restrict the ability of the company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends and certain dividends require prior regulatory approval in addition some of the company’s businesses and related activities may be subject to ppo mco utilization review or tparelated licensure requirements and regulations these licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state but may contain provider network contracting product and rate financial and reporting requirements there also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the company’s delivery of services payment of claims fraud prevention protection of consumer health information and payment for covered benefits and services 

required regulatory approvals  the company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to price market and administer many of its health care benefits products supervisory agencies including cms the center for consumer information and insurance oversight and the dol as well as state health insurance managed care and medicaid agencies have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions 

• grant suspend and revoke the company’s licenses to transact business 

• suspend or exclude the company from participation in government programs 

• suspend or limit the company’s authority to market products 

• regulate many aspects of the products and services the company offers including the pricing and underwriting of many of its products and services 

• assess damages fines andor penalties 

• terminate the company’s contract with the government agency andor withhold payments from the government agency to the company 

• impose retroactive adjustments to premiums and require the company to pay refunds to the government customers andor members 

• restrict the company’s ability to conduct acquisitions or dispositions 

• require the company to maintain minimum capital levels in its subsidiaries and monitor its solvency and reserve adequacy 

• regulate the company’s investment activities on the basis of quality diversification and other quantitative criteria andor 

• exclude the company’s plans from participating in public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” premium rate increases or fail to meet other criteria set by hhs or the applicable state 

the company’s operations current and past business practices current and past contracts and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine regular and special investigations audits examinations and reviews by and from time to time the company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from federal state and international supervisory and enforcement agencies attorneys general and other state federal and international governmental authorities and legislators 

commercial product pricing and underwriting restrictions  pricing and underwriting regulation by states limits the company’s underwriting and rating practices and those of other health insurers particularly for small employer groups and varies by state in general these limitations apply to certain customer segments and limit the company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups or both based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior claim experience in some states these laws and regulations restrict the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes andor reflect reasonable costs in the company’s pricing 

the aca expanded the premium rate review process by among other things requiring the company’s commercial insured rates to be reviewed for “reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level hhs established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate increases equal to or exceeding a federally or lower state specified threshold hhs’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as well as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold these combined state and federal review requirements may prevent further delay or otherwise affect the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes which could adversely affect its mbrs and operating results particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services andor medical cost trend or when such utilization andor trend exceeds the company’s projections 

the aca also specifies minimum mlrs of 85 for large group commercial products and 80 for individual and small group commercial products because the aca minimum mlrs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for commercial products states have and may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” incorporate minimum mlr requirements into prospective premium rate filings require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured commercial products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

in addition the company requested increases in its premium rates in its commercial health care benefits business for 2020 including as a result of the reinstatement of the hif for 2020 following the temporary suspension of the hif for 2019 and expects to continue to request increases in those rates for 2021 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and rating limits and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments including as a result of the aca the company’s rates also must be adequate to reflect adverse selection in its products particularly in small group commercial products these rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

many of the laws and regulations governing the company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other carriers may charge between new and renewal business andor between groups based on differing characteristics they may also require that carriers disclose to customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage 

medicaid regulation  the company is seeking to substantially grow its medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next several years as a result the company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to the company under those programs 

since 2017 managed medicaid products including those the company offers are subject to a minimum federal mlr of 85 a medicaid managed care quality rating system and provider network adequacy requirements also apply to medicaid products because the federal minimum mlr is structured as a “floor” states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for managed medicaid products states may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured medicaid products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

the future of the aca and the impact of medicaid expansion under the aca are uncertain states may opt out of the elements of the aca requiring expansion of medicaid coverage without losing their current federal medicaid funding to date a number of states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid coverage to the higher eligibility levels contemplated by the aca in addition the election of new governors andor state legislatures may impact states’ previous decisions regarding medicaid expansion proposals for substantial changes to federal funding of state medicaid programs are likely to be considered in 2020 and beyond including the possibility of converting federal medicaid support to block grants such as the block grant option outlined by cms on january 30 2020 and per capita caps on federal funding uncertainty regarding federal funding is causing and will continue to cause states to reevaluate their medicaid expansions and consider new assessments fees andor taxes on health plans that reevaluation and any changes to federal funding of state medicaid programs may adversely affect medicaid payment rates the company’s revenues and its medicaid membership 

the economic aspects of the medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change medicaid premiums are paid by each state and differ from state to state the federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation for medicaid and dual eligible program reforms or redesigns including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by medicaid mcos and their contracted pbms further program population andor geographic expansions of riskbased managed care increasing beneficiary costsharing or payment levels and changes to benefits reimbursement eligibility criteria provider network adequacy requirements including requiring the inclusion of specified high cost providers in the company’s networks and program structure in some states current medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not be adequate for the company to continue program participation the company’s medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states or sponsors of medicaid managed care plans are subject to cancellation by the state or the sponsors of the managed care plans after a short notice period without cause eg when a state discontinues a managed care program or in the event of insufficient state funding 

the company’s medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies which have the right to audit the company’s performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations the company’s medicaid products dual eligible products and chip contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services network requirements including mandatory inclusion of specified highcost providers and other aspects of these programs and by external review organizations which audit medicaid plans on behalf of state medicaid agencies the laws regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other participants in medicaid and dual eligible programs including requirements that the company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms andor state medicaid agencies may fine the company withhold payments to the company seek premium and other refunds terminate the company’s existing contracts elect not to award the company new contracts or not to renew the company’s existing contracts prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the company’s medicaid or dual eligible products exclude the company from participating in one or more medicaid or dual eligible programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms or state regulations or contractual requirements 

the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the medicaid program nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results but the effects could be materially adverse 

federal and state reporting  the company is subject to extensive financial and business reporting requirements including penalties for inaccuracies andor omissions at both the federal and state level the company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from third parties that may not be readily available or reliably provided in all instances the company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems dedicate significant resources 

and incur significant expenses to comply with these requirements however the company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailability of or errors in its reports 

product design and administration and sales practices  state andor federal regulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration and marketing and advertising practices including the filing of insurance policy forms the adequacy of provider networks the accuracy of provider directories and the adequacy of disclosure regarding products and their administration is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices medicare medicaid and dual eligible products and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny 

guaranty fund assessmentssolvency protection  under guaranty fund laws existing in all states insurers doing business in those states can be assessed in most states up to prescribed limits for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants the life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of longterm care insurers as well as health insurers the company’s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to the company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes some states have similar laws relating to hmos andor other payors such as notforprofit consumer governed health plans established under the aca while historically the company has ultimately recovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative andor regulatory actions that limit future offsets

risks related to covid19 

the spread of impact of and response to covid19 underscores and amplifies certain risks we face the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be material and adverse 

covid19 has spread to every state in the us has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization and has severely impacted and is expected to continue to severely impact the economies of the us and other countries around the world 

the legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently including the families first act the cares act and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our health care benefits insured products as a result of covid19 including legislative andor regulatory responses to covid19 the premiums we charge in our insured health care benefits products may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our insured medical members which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs 

federal state and local governmental policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 including shelterinplace orders and social distancing directives may not effectively combat the severity andor duration of the covid19 pandemic and have resulted in among other things a reduction in utilization that is discretionary the cancellation of elective medical procedures reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies our customers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations the adoption of workfromhome policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to reductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records all of which impact our businesses among other impacts of these policies and initiatives on our businesses we expect changes in medical claims submission patterns and an adverse impact on i drug utilization due to the reduction in discretionary visits with providers ii front store sales as a result of reduced customer traffic in our retail pharmacies due to shelterinplace orders and covid19 related unemployment iii medical membership in our health care benefits segment and covered lives in our pbm clients due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers including due to business failures as well as reduced willingness to change benefits providers by prospective customers iv benefit costs due to covid19 related support programs we have put in place for our medical members and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our insured health care benefits products and v the amount timing and collectability of payments to the company from customers clients government payers and members as a result of the impact of covid19 on them over time these policies and initiatives also may cause us to experience increased benefit costs andor decreased revenues in our health care benefits segment if as a result of our medical members not seeing their providers as a result of covid19 we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage benefit costs and chronic conditions of our medical members and appropriately document their risk profiles 

in addition in response to covid19 during the first half of 2020 we began to offer our medical members expanded benefit coverage and became obligated by governmental action to provide other additional coverage this expanded benefit coverage is being provided without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our insured health care benefits products we also are taking actions designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health care provider community such measures and any further steps we take or are required to take to expand or otherwise modify the services delivered to our health care benefits members provide relief for the health care provider community or in connection with the relaxation of shelterinplace orders and social distancing directives and other restrictions on movement and economic activity intended to reduce the spread of covid19 including the potential for widespread testing and vaccination as a component of lifting those measures could adversely impact our benefit costs mbr and operating results 

the various initiatives we have implemented to slow andor reduce the impact of covid19 such as colleagues working remotely and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies and the covid19related support programs we have put in place for our customers medical members and colleagues have increased our operating expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations our operating results will continue to be adversely affected so long as these initiatives continue or if they are expanded in addition the adverse economic conditions in the us and abroad caused by covid19 have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our net investment income and the value of our investment portfolio 

the spread of covid19 or actions taken to mitigate its spread could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities labor shortages andor financial difficulties experienced by thirdparty service providers disruptions in our supply chains our distribution chains and 

or public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services could materially and adversely impact our business operations we have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 as have a significant number of our thirdparty service providers which may amplify certain risks to our businesses including an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other thirdparties and increased risk of business interruptions 

while the fda has authorized some covid19 vaccines for emergency use the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the severity and duration of the pandemic and scope and intensity of the governmental response to it are unknown at this time we believe covid19’s impact on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to the pandemic those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material covid19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations and claims against us 

a number of factors many of which are beyond our control including covid19 and related testing and vaccination contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs which could adversely affect our health care benefits segment’s operating results there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections 

as a result of covid19 the current economic environment is adverse and less predictable than recently experienced which has caused and may continue to cause unanticipated and significant volatility in our health care and other benefits costs including covid19 related testing and vaccination and postacute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs on january 21 2021 the president of the united states issued an executive order to support government efforts to expand access availability and use of covid19 diagnostic screening and surveillance and addressed the cost of covid19 testing by facilitating covid19 testing free of charge to those who lack comprehensive health insurance and clarifying group health plans’ and health insurance issuers’ obligations to provide coverage for covid19 testing in addition the timing of vaccine administration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new more infectious strains of the covid19 virus and whether the vaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our mbr premiums for our insured health care benefits products which comprised 92 of our health care benefits revenues for 2020 are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period which is generally twelve months these forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums as a result our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends for 2021 those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing vaccines direct covid19 treatment and deferred care riskadjusted revenue has been adjusted for deferred care and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment though covid19 related impacts remain uncertain during periods such as 2020 and 2021 when health care and other benefit costs utilization andor medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of covid19 accurately detecting forecasting managing reserving and pricing for our and our selfinsured customers’ medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing and our health care and other benefit costs including covid19 related testing and vaccination and postacute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs are affected by covid19 and other external events over which we have no control even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our health care benefits segment’s operating results 

a number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs including covid19 previously uninsured members entering the health care system changes in members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes including under the families first act and the cares act changes in the health status of our members the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics advances in medical technology increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs including specialty 

pharmacy drugs and ultrahigh cost drugs and therapies directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers the increasing influence of social media on our members’ health care utilization and other behaviors changes in health care practices and general economic conditions such as inflation and employment levels in addition governmentimposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time and future amendments or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may amplify this problem other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics changes as a result of the aca changes to or the discontinuation of the aca and other changes in the regulatory environment the evolution toward a consumer driven business model new technologies influenzarelated health care costs which may be substantial clusters of highcost cases health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results these risks are particularly acute during periods such as 2020 and 2021 when health care and other benefit costs utilization andor medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of covid19 such risks are further magnified by the aca and other existing and future legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections 

adverse economic conditions in the us and abroad can materially and adversely impact our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

the covid19 pandemic the availability and cost of credit and other capital higher unemployment rates and other factors have contributed to adverse conditions in the global economy and significantly diminished expectations for the global economy and particularly the us economy at least through the end of 2020 and possibly longer our customers medical providers and the other companies with which we do business are generally headquartered in the us however many of our largest customers are global companies with operations around the world as a result adverse economic conditions in the us and abroad including those caused by covid19 can materially and adversely impact our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition including 

• in our pharmacy services segment by causing drug utilization to decline reducing demand for pbm services and adversely affecting the financial health of our pbm clients 

• in our retailltc segment by causing drug utilization to decline changing consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns leading to reduced consumer demand for products sold in our stores and adversely affecting the financial health of our ltc pharmacy customers 

• by causing our existing customers to reduce workforces including due to business failures which would reduce our revenues the number of covered lives in our pbm clients andor the number of members our health care benefits segment serves 

• by causing our clients and customers and potential clients and customers particularly those with the most employees or members and state and local governments to force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service including service discount and other performance guarantees to retain or obtain their business 

• by causing customers and potential customers of our retailltc and health care benefits segments to purchase fewer products andor products that generate less profit for us than the ones they currently purchase or otherwise would have purchased 

• by causing customers and potential customers of our health care benefits segment particularly smaller employers and individuals to forego obtaining or renewing their health and other coverage with us 

• in our health care benefits segment by causing unanticipated increases and volatility in utilization of medical and other covered services including covid19 related testing vaccination and behavioral health services by our medical members changes in medical claim submission patterns andor increases in medical unit costs andor provider behavior each of which would increase our costs and limit our ability to accurately detect forecast manage reserve and price for our and our selfinsured customers’ medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs 

• by increasing medical unit costs and causing changes in provider behavior in our health care benefits segment as hospitals and other providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own covid19related and other economic challenges 

• by weakening the ability or perceived ability of the issuers andor guarantors of the debt or other securities we hold in our investment portfolio to perform on their obligations to us which could result in defaults in those securities and has reduced and may further reduce the value of those securities and has created and may continue to create net realized capital losses for us that reduce our operating results 

• by weakening the ability of our customers including selfinsured customers in our health care benefits segment medical providers and the other companies with which we do business as well as our medical members to perform their obligations to us or causing them not to perform those obligations either of which could reduce our operating results 

• by weakening the ability of our former subsidiaries andor their purchasers to satisfy their lease obligations that we have guaranteed and causing the company to be required to satisfy those obligations 

• by weakening the financial condition of other insurers including longterm care insurers and life insurers which increases the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers to policyholders and claimants 

• by causing over time inflation that could cause interest rates to increase and thereby increase our interest expense and reduce our operating results as well as decrease the value of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio which would reduce our operating results andor adversely affect our financial condition 

furthermore reductions in workforce by our customers can cause unanticipated increases in the health care and other benefits costs of our health care benefits segment for example our business associated with members who have elected to receive benefits under consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act known as “cobra” typically has an mbr that is significantly higher than our overall commercial mbr 

risks relating to our businesses 

each of our segments operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment and gross margins in the industries in which we compete may decline 

each of our segments pharmacy services which includes our pharmacy benefit management “pbm” business retailltc and health care benefits operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment specifically 

• as competition increases in the geographies in which we operate including competition from new entrants a significant increase in price compression andor reimbursement pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive 

• the competitive success of our pharmacy services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies as pbm clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

• the competitive success of our retailltc segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms as the payors’ clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

• in our pbm business we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer’s rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual requirements including the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline our operating results cash flows andor prospects could be adversely affected 

• the pbm industry has been experiencing price compression as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices increased revenue sharing including sharing in a larger portion of rebates received from drug manufacturers enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trends to continue 

• our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operations have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition including client demands for lower prices generic drug pricing earlier than expected generic drug introductions and network reimbursement pressure if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate 

the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 

• a shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates as a result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect our margins including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day prescriptions at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions 

• pbm client contracts often are for a period of approximately three years however pbm clients may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to contract expiration pbm clients are generally well informed can move between us and our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts we are therefore under pressure to contain price increases despite being faced with increasing drug costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 

• the operating results and margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements and by the financial health of and purchases and sales of our ltc customers 

• in our health care benefits segment we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan membership over the next several years in many instances to acquire and retain our government customers’ business we must bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment winning bids often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency 

• customer contracts in our health care benefits segment are generally for a period of one year and our customers have considerable flexibility in moving between us and our competitors one of the key factors on which we compete for customers especially in uncertain economic environments is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results in response to rising prices our customers may elect to selfinsure or to reduce benefits in order to limit increases in their benefit costs alternatively our customers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable such elections may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured products andor lower premiums for our insured products which may adversely affect our revenues and operating results although such elections also may reduce our health care and other benefit costs in addition our medicare medicaid and chip products are subject to termination without cause periodic rebid rate adjustment and program redesign as customers seek to contain their benefit costs particularly in an uncertain economy and our exposure to this risk is increasing as we grow our government products membership these actions may adversely affect our membership revenues and operating results 

• we requested increases in our premium rates in our commercial health care benefits business for 2021 and expect to continue to request increases in those rates for 2022 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and rating limits and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by federal and state governments including as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “aca” our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selected by people with a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable products also known as “adverse selection” particularly in small group commercial products these rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

in addition competitors in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition also may come from new entrants and other sources in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in the rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such alterations and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example decisions to buy our pharmacy services and health care benefits products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers either through direct purchasing eg medicare advantage plans and pdps or through public health insurance exchanges “public exchanges” and private health insurance exchanges together with public exchanges collectively “insurance exchanges” that allow individual choice consumers also are increasingly seeking to access consumer goods and health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile 

devices and websites to compete effectively in the consumerdriven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences 

changes in marketplace dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and decisions to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor prospects 

a change in our health care benefits product mix may adversely affect our profit margins 

our insured health care benefits products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc products historically smaller employer groups have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures although over the last several years even relatively small employers have moved to asc products we also serve and expect to grow our business with governmentsponsored programs including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profit margins than our commercial insured health care benefits products a shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on the health care benefits segment’s operating results 

negative public perception of the industries in which we operate or of our industries’ or our practices can adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and prospects 

our brand and reputation are two of our most important assets and the industries in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public from time to time negative publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage litigation against us and other industry participants the ongoing public debates over drug pricing pbms government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing the future of the aca “surprise” medical bills governmental hearings andor investigations actual or perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products andor business practices including pbm operations drug pricing and insurance coverage determinations and social media and other media relations activities negative publicity also may come from a failure to meet customer expectations for consistent high quality and accessible care this risk may increase as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data and as our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumers 

in addition by working with the us government in the distribution and administration of the covid19 vaccine the company may be subject to negative publicity related to the government’s actions in response to covid19 that are outside of the ability of the company to control 

negative public perception andor publicity of our industries in general or of us or our key vendors brokers or product distribution networks in particular can further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results and our stock price by 

• adversely affecting our brand and reputation 

• adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our products andor services andor retain our existing customers and members 

• requiring us to change our products andor services 

• reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our products andor services andor 

• increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirements with which we must comply 

we must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services including proprietary brands 

the success of our businesses depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and clients and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products we also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retail operations including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our retail business operating results cash flows andor financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating results and erode customer loyalty 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business operating results and cash flows 

we face risks relating to the availability pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

the profitability of our retailltc and pharmacy services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products we dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacies and the retail pharmacies in our pbm’s network also dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs our revenues operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced including due to 

• increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions 

• manufacturing or other supply issues 

• certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to overthecounter products 

• future fda rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products 

• the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products or 

• inflation in the price of brand name drugs 

in addition increased utilization of generic drugs which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 

a number of factors many of which are beyond our control contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs which could adversely affect our health care benefits segment’s operating results 

premiums for our insured health care benefits products which comprised 92 of our health care benefits revenues for 2020 are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period which is generally one year these forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and require a significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums as 

a result our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our operating results 

a number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs including previously uninsured members entering the health care system changes in members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes changes in the health status of our members the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics advances in medical technology increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultrahigh cost drugs and therapies directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers the increasing influence of social media on our members’ health care utilization and other behaviors changes in health care practices and general economic conditions such as inflation and employment levels in addition governmentimposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time and future amendments or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include changes as a result of the aca changes to the aca and other changes in the regulatory environment the evolution toward a consumer driven business model new technologies influenza related health care costs which may be substantial and higher than we project clusters of highcost cases epidemics or pandemics health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control for example the 20202021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of covid19 and the 20192020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza than the 20182019 influenza season 

our health care benefits segment’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect the factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results 

the reserves we hold for expected claims in our insured health care benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited 

a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the mlr rules of the aca cms and the opm and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program 

our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns andor procedures turnover and other changes in membership changes in product mix changes in the utilization of medical andor other covered services including prescription drugs changes in medical cost trends changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products we estimate health care costs payable periodically and any resulting adjustments including premium deficiency reserves are reflected in currentperiod operating results within benefit costs for example as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we established a premium deficiency reserve of 11 million and 4 million respectively related to medicaid products in the health care benefits segment a worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of december 31 2020 would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results these risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical andor other covered services andor medical cost trends are below recent historical levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risks are 

further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

our operating results are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve 

our businesses are affected by the us economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve including various economic factors including inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment could cause a decline in drug utilization an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores 

if our customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing our customers may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition both state and federal government sponsored payers as a result of budget deficits or spending reductions may suspend payments or seek to reduce their health care expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us 

further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms and the value of our investment portfolio adverse changes in the us economy consumer confidence and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future andor decrease our prescription volumes 

in addition our health care benefits membership remains concentrated in certain us geographies and in certain industries unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefits segment’s operating results our health care benefits membership has been and may continue to be affected by workforce reductions by our customers due to adverse andor uncertain general economic conditions especially in the us geographies and industries where our membership is concentrated as a result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefits membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenues and operating results may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers 

we are exposed to risks relating to the solvency of other insurers 

we are subject to assessments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies including longterm care insurers hmos aca coops and other payors to policyholders and claimants for example in the first quarter of 2017 aetna recorded a discounted estimated liability expense of 231 million pretax for our estimated share of future assessments for longterm care insurer penn treaty network america insurance company and one of its subsidiaries guaranty funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer hmo aca coop andor other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its financial obligations these funds are usually financed by assessments against insurers regulated by a state future assessments may have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 

extreme events or the threat of extreme events could materially increase our health care including behavioral health costs 

nuclear biological or other attacks whether as a result of war or terrorism other manmade disasters natural disasters epidemics pandemics and other extreme events can affect the us economy in general our industries and us specifically in particular such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could result in significant health care including behavioral health costs which also would be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and other insurers such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events also could disrupt our supply chains andor our distribution chains for the products we sell in addition our employees and those of our vendors are concentrated in certain large metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed to these events such events could adversely affect our businesses 

operating results and cash flows and in the event of extreme circumstances our financial condition or viability particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors 

risks from changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to potential changes in public policy laws and regulations including reform of the us health care system which can adversely affect our businesses entitlement program reform if it occurs could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operations andor operating results 

the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operations and operating results could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation andor increased regulation of pbms including changes to the medicare or medicaid programs including the block grant option outlined by cms on january 30 2020 the “block grant option” or the regulatory environment for health care and related benefits including the aca changes to laws or regulations governing drug reimbursement andor pricing changes to the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changes to laws andor regulations governing drug manufacturers’ rebates changes to laws andor regulations governing reimbursements paid to pharmacists by andor reporting required by pbms changes to immigration policies andor other public policy initiatives it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of us presidential executive orders other significant changes to health care and related benefits system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries also are possible and could adversely affect our businesses if we fail to respond adequately to such changes including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives or do not respond as effectively as our competitors our businesses operations and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

in addition to efforts to amend repeal or replace the aca and related regulations we expect the federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and our businesses potential modification to the aca including changes in enforcement andor funding that further destabilize the public exchanges as well as significant changes to medicaid funding including the block grant option could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further changes to federal health care and related benefits laws including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing laws laws governing pbms andor laws governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs are probable we cannot predict the effect if any that new health care and related benefits legislation future changes to the aca or the implementation of or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca may have on our pharmacy services retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy andor health care benefits operations andor operating results the federal and many state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation enforcement andor application of existing programs laws and regulations including changes to payments under and funding of medicare and medicaid programs and increased regulation of pbms 

further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of pbms including formulary management or other pbm services drug pricing or purchasing patent term extensions andor purchase discount andor rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers also could reduce the discounts or rebates we receive changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees also could adversely affect our profitability for example on october 29 2020 the hhs released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose drug pricing and costsharing information the final rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose costsharing information upon request to a participant beneficiary or enrollee which unless otherwise indicated for the purpose of the final rules includes an authorized representative and requires plans and issuers to disclose innetwork provider rates historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and the associated billed charges and 

negotiated rates for prescription drugs the public disclosure of insurer or pbmnegotiated price concessions may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers 

in addition in november 2020 the hhs released the rebate rule which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the aks for rebates from pharmaceutical companies to pbms in medicare part d and in medicaid mcos replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patients with high outofpocket costs and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbors are i for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale 

and ii for flat service fee payments made to pbms which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs the pcma which represents pbms has filed a suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premiums in medicare part d and was adopted in an unlawful manner it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced and what the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company 

we cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operations or operating results which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matters it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we compete examples of such changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation changing the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 

for more information on these matters see “government regulation” included in item 1 of this 10k 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations many of which are highly complex we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions or suffer brand and reputational harm 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state federal and international governmental authorities the laws and regulations governing our operations and interpretations of those laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflict with one another in general these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers members and providers rather than us or our investors in addition the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year we also must follow various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries put in place by certain state regulators 

certain of our pharmacy services and retailltc operations products and services are subject to 

• the clinical quality patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors any failure by our pharmacy services andor retailltc operations to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of drugs could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

• federal and state antikickback and other laws that govern our relationship with drug manufacturers customers and consumers 

• compliance requirements under erisa including fiduciary obligations in connection with the development and implementation of items such as drug formularies and preferred drug listings and 

• federal and state legislative proposals andor regulatory activity that could adversely affect pharmacy benefit industry practices 

our health care benefits products are highly regulated particularly those that serve medicare medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs and small group commercial customers and members the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for noncompliance 

the scope of the practices and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit and we are a defendant in a number of such proceedings if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the false claims act we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs including medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs and we also may be required to pay significant fines andor other monetary penalties whistleblower suits have 

resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies the significant incentives and protections provided to whistleblowers under applicable law increase the risk of whistleblower suits 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations that apply to government programs we could be subject to criminal fines civil penalties premium refunds prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs plan and other programs and on our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses profitability and growth also may be adversely affected by i judicial and regulatory decisions that change andor expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations impose medical or bad faith liability increase our responsibilities under erisa or the remedies available under erisa or reduce the scope of erisa preemption of state law claims or ii other legislation and regulations for example in december 2020 the us supreme court upheld an arkansas law that among other things mandates a particular pricing methodology establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate prohibits a pbm from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost 

if our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatory actions andor litigation 

in addition to being subject to extensive and complex regulations many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements in order to be eligible to offer certain products or bid on certain contracts we must demonstrate that we have robust systems and processes in place that are designed to maintain compliance with all applicable legal regulatory and contractual requirements these systems and processes frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers and regulators if our systems and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements and to prevent and detect instances of or the potential for noncompliance fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions litigation and other proceedings which may result in damages fines suspension or loss of licensure suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs andor other penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we routinely are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings including class actions and qui tam actions many of these proceedings seek substantial damages which may not be covered by insurance these proceedings are costly to defend may result in changes in our business practices harm our brand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and operating results 

pbm retail pharmacy mail order pharmacy specialty pharmacy ltc pharmacy and health care and related benefits are highly regulated industries whose participants frequently are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings we are currently subject to various litigation and arbitration matters investigations regulatory audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and other legal proceedings both inside and outside the us outside the us contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the us litigation related to our provision of professional services in our medical clinics pharmacies and ltc operations is increasing as we expand our services along the continuum of health care 

litigation and particularly securities derivative collective or class action and qui tam litigation is often expensive and disruptive many of the legal proceedings against us seek substantial damages including noneconomic or punitive damages and treble damages and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in our business practices while we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage andor the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability also may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the outcome of litigation and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law or regulation can and do occur and the costs incurred frequently are substantial regardless of the outcome litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses operating results andor cash flows because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings 

the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings see item 3 of this 10k for additional information 

we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in material refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities and other sanctions 

as one of the largest national retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacy pbm and health care and related benefits providers we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental market conduct and other audits investigations and reviews by and we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from various federal and state agencies regulatory authorities attorneys general committees subcommittees and members of the us congress and other state federal and international governmental authorities for example we have received cids from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program cms and the oig also are auditing the risk adjustmentrelated data of certain of our medicare advantage plans and the number of such audits continues to increase several such audits investigations and reviews by governmental authorities currently are pending some of which may be resolved in 2021 the results of which may be adverse to us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical andor other covered services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources in addition our medical costs and the medical expenses of our health care benefits asc customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by providers andor members 

regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews by federal state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in significant or material premium refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure any of these audits investigations or reviews could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us 

see “legal and regulatory proceedings” in note 16 ‘‘commitments and contingencies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information 

our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as we offer new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical core businesses of pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits 

historically we focused primarily on providing pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits products and services as a result of our transformation program and other innovation initiatives we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new products and services such as the home hemodialysis device we are developing which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically have offered 

the increased volume of business in areas beyond our historical core businesses and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that are different from the risks of providing pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits products and services and increase significantly our exposure to other risks 

we face unique regulatory and other challenges in our medicare and medicaid businesses 

we are seeking to substantially grow the medicare and medicaid membership in our health care benefits segment in 2020 and over the next several years we face unique regulatory and other challenges that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those businesses 

• in april 2020 cms issued a final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rates for 2021 the “final notice” overall we project the benchmark rates in the final notice will increase funding for our medicare advantage 

business excluding the impact of the hif in 2020 by approximately 18 in 2021 compared to 2020 this 2021 rate increase only partially offsets the challenge we face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications and cms local and national coverage decisions that require us to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into our bids and creates continued pressure on our medicare advantage operating results in january 2021 cms issued its final notice detailing final 2022 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates final 2022 medicare advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 41 we cannot predict future medicare funding levels the impact of future federal budget actions or ensure that such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our medicare operating results 

• the organic expansion of our medicare advantage and medicare part d service area is subject to the ability of cms to process our requests for service area expansions and our ability to build cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements cms’ decisions on our requests for service area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations 

• cms regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with cms’s regulations and our contracts with cms and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our medicare members as a result of these audits we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustments to andor withholding of certain premiums and fees fines criminal liability civil monetary penalties cms imposed sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs or other restrictions on our medicare medicaid and other businesses including suspension or loss of licensure 

• “star ratings” from cms for our medicare advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans’ operating results since 2015 only medicare advantage plans with a star rating of four or higher out of five are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates cms continues to change its rating system to make achieving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult our star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations if our star ratings fall below four for a significant portion of our medicare advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated our revenues operating results and cash flows may be significantly adversely affected 

• payments we receive from cms for our medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals we enroll elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the amount of our medicare reimbursement require us to raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit our and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

• changes to the ability of pbms to have pharmacy performance programs in place for clients and report payments via direct and indirect reporting mechanisms could impact the pharmacy services business 

• medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of the aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules clients of our pbm business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d products 

• our medicare part d operating results and our ability to expand our medicare part d business could be adversely affected if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our medicare part d business changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies the government alters medicare part d program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons the government mandated use of pointofsale manufacturer’s rebates effective in 2022 continues the government makes changes to how pharmacy payforperformance is calculated or reinsurance thresholds are reduced below their current levels 

• we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid operating results and cash flows andor our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

• federal funding for expanded medicaid coverage began to decrease in 2017 this reduction is causing states to reevaluate funding for their medicaid expansions that reevaluation may adversely affect medicaid payment rates our medicaid membership in those states our revenues our mlrs and our operating results 

• if we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a cms audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines civil monetary penalties or other sanctions including fines and penalties under the false claims act which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage part d or other government programs and on our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

• in the second quarter of 2014 cms issued a final rule implementing aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms however cms’s statements in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to medicare advantage plans appear to be inconsistent with cms’s prior radv audit guidance these statements appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the fee for service adjustment comparison contemplated by cms’s radv audit methodology the precise interpretation impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation if medicare advantage plans were not paid based on payment model principles that align with the requirements of the social security act or such payments were not implemented correctly it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

• certain of our medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and in part to set premium rates we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate or to correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid operating results and cash flows andor our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

• our businesses that dispense drugs also face challenges in the medicaid space the aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement rates one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement formula for generic drugs this change has adversely affected the reimbursements we receive when we dispense prescription drugs to medicaid recipients 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase as our government funded businesses grow our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases 

our revenues from government funded programs including in health care benefits’ medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses and from government customers in its commercial business are dependent on annual funding by the federal government andor applicable state or local governments federal state and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities 

the us federal government and our other government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs cancel or decline to renew contracts with us or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs the services provided to enrollees in such programs our premiums and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows when federal funding is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive and we remain liable for and are required to fund claims from providers for providing services to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate an extended federal government shutdown or a delay by congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling 

also could lead to a delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could in turn have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses operating results cash flows and liquidity 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm and retailltc businesses 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts drug purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practices in health care benefits’ commercial and other government products 

future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from our pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with drug manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections we cannot predict the effect of these possible changes on our businesses 

we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increases in our insured health care benefits products which would have an adverse effect on our revenues mbrs and operating results and could magnify the adverse impact of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of aca assessments fees and taxes 

premium rates for our insured health care benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval which creates risk for us in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires a review by hhs in conjunction with state regulators of premium rate increases that exceed a federally specified threshold or lower statespecific thresholds set by states determined by hhs to have adequate processes rate reviews can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins mbrs and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit costs increased utilization of covered services and aca assessments fees and taxes by restricting our ability to reflect these increases andor these assessments fees and taxes in our pricing further our ability to reflect aca assessments fees and taxes in our medicare medicaid and chip premium rates is limited 

since 2013 hhs has issued determinations to health plans that their premium rate increases were “unreasonable” and we continue to experience challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in certain states regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rate increases either by enforcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards regulators or legislatures in several states also have conducted hearings on proposed premium rate increases which can result and in some instances have resulted in substantial delays in implementing proposed rate increases even if they ultimately are approved our plans can be excluded from participating in small group public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could adversely affect our mbrs and lead to operating margin compression 

we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our insured health care benefits products we may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies if we are unable to obtain adequate premium rates andor premium rate increases it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and mbrs and our ability to earn adequate returns on insured health care benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies andor products 

minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefits products while leaving us exposed to higher than expected medical costs challenges to our minimum mlr rebate methodology andor reports could adversely affect our operating results 

the aca’s minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in health care benefits’ commercial insured and medicare insured businesses cms minimum mlr rebate regulations limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portions of our health care benefits medicaid and federal employees health benefits “fehb” program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebates payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirements are detailed cms has also proposed but not yet finalized a definition of “prescription drug price concessions” for commercial mlr calculation purposes which would make additional pbm information available to plans and the hhs potentially further complicating the mlr calculation process federal and state auditors are challenging our commercial health care benefits business’ compliance with the aca’s minimum mlr requirements as well as our fehb plans’ compliance with opm’s fehb programspecific minimum mlr requirements our medicare and medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum mlr audits if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms additional challenges to our methodology andor reports relating to minimum mlr and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible the outcome of these audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity 

the federal and certain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business including increased minimum wages and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave in addition our employeerelated operating costs may be increased by union organizing activity if we are unable to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases our operating results will be adversely affected 

we face international political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domestic operations 

we significantly expanded our international operations as a result of the aetna acquisition as a result of our expanded international operations we face political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations these risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints our international products need to meet countryspecific customer and member preferences as well as countryspecific legal requirements including those related to licensing data privacy data storage and data protection 

our international operations increase our exposure to and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of nonus jurisdictions such as the eu’s gdpr and the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws of the united states including the fcpa and the united kingdom including the uk bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions implementing our compliance policies internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resources over several years before any significant revenues or profits are generated violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we must regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our businesses and operations our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results andor financial condition 

our international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages cultures legal and regulatory schemes and time zones our international operations encounter labor laws standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate in 

some countries we are required to or choose to operate with local business associates which requires us to manage our relationships with these third parties and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges 

in some countries we may be exposed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting local currencies into us dollars or other currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues operating results and cash flows from our international operations some of our operations are and are increasingly likely to be in emerging markets where these risks are heightened any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective 

risks associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies we acquire 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company also may be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies andor growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

• integrating personnel operations and systems including internal control environments and compliance policies while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent high quality products and services 

• coordinating geographically dispersed organizations 

• disrupting management’s attention from our ongoing business operations 

• retaining existing customers and attracting new customers and 

• managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and operating results furthermore acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or service areas and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities which may be unsuccessful cause us to assume unanticipated liabilities disrupt our existing businesses be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy in addition to the integration risks noted above some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include 

• we frequently compete with other firms some of which may have greater financial and other resources and a greater tolerance for risk to acquire attractive companies 

• the acquired alliance andor joint venture businesses may not perform as projected 

• the goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of our acquisitions may be incorrectly valued or may become impaired for example in 2018 we took 61 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our ltc reporting unit within the retailltc segment 

• we may assume unanticipated liabilities including those that were not disclosed to us or which we underestimated 

• the acquired businesses or the pursuit of other inorganic growth strategies could disrupt or compete with our existing businesses distract management result in the loss of key employees divert resources result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards controls information technology systems policies procedures and performance 

• as we did in the aetna acquisition we may finance future acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price which would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 

• as we did in the aetna acquisition we may incur significant debt in connection with acquisitions whether to finance acquisitions or by assuming debt from the businesses we acquire 

• we may not have the expertise to manage and profitably grow the businesses we acquire and we may need to rely on the retention of key personnel and other suppliers of businesses we acquire which may be difficult or impossible to accomplish 

• we may enter into merger or purchase agreements but due to reasons within or outside our control fail to complete the related transactions which could result in termination fees or other penalties that could be material cause material disruptions to our businesses and operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation 

• in order to complete a proposed acquisition we may be required to divest certain portions of our business for which we may not be able to obtain favorable pricing 

• as is the case with the aetna acquisition and our acquisition of omnicare inc we may be involved in litigation related to mergers or acquisitions including for matters that occurred prior to the applicable closing which may be costly to defend and may result in adverse rulings against us that could be material and 

• the integration into our businesses of the businesses and entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and regulations apply to us including subjecting us to laws and regulations that did not previously apply to us 

in addition joint ventures present risks that are different from acquisitions including selection of appropriate joint venture parties initial and ongoing governance of the joint venture joint venture compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the joint venture’s business in a manner acceptable to all the parties including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures maintaining positive relationships among the joint venture parties and the joint venture’s customers and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination 

risks related to our operations 

failure to meet customer expectations may harm our brand and reputation our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership and our operating results and cash flows 

our ability to attract and retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective quality customer service operations such as call center operations pbm functions retail pharmacy and ltc services retail mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claims processing customer case installation and online access and tools that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations either directly or through vendors as we seek to reduce general and administrative expenses we must balance the potential impact of costsaving measures on our customers and other services and performances if we misjudge the effects of such measures customers and other services may be adversely affected we depend on third parties for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operations if we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations we may have difficulty retaining or profitably growing our customer base andor membership which could adversely affect our operating results for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our thirdparty vendors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results brand and reputation 

we and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience cyber attacks we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future 

we and our vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward as examples the company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems denial of service attacks attempted malware infections account takeovers scanning activity and phishing emails attacks can originate from external criminals terrorists nation states or internal actors the company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage the impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the company’s operations or operating results through december 31 2020 the board and its audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are regularly informed regarding the company’s information security policies practices and status 

a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to a cyberincident are significant large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information following a cyberincident our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberincident could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and members in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers our members or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ private information and our customers members and other constituents to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation businesses and prospects our use and disclosure of members’ customers’ and other constituents’ sensitive information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels we would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or other vendors fail to adequately protect members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information 

our information systems are critical to the operation of our businesses we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of personal health and financial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers members and other constituents in the ordinary course of our businesses some of our information systems rely upon third party systems including cloud service providers to accomplish these tasks the use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal state and international levels and these laws rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity such as the california consumer privacy act which went into effect january 1 2020 the eu’s gdpr which began to apply across the eu during 2018 and the audit program implemented by hhs under hipaa in some cases such laws rules and regulations also apply to our vendors andor may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than us laws and regulations and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach cyber attack or cybersecurity breach and any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential customer member or other constituent information whether by us by one of our business associates or vendors or by another third party could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage could interrupt our operations and could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition 

our businesses depend on our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which 

could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information there can be no assurance that additional such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of drugs and consuming drugs in a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide for example we are a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings relating to opioids and the sale of products containing talc our businesses involve the provision of professional services including by pharmacists physician assistants nurses and nurse practitioners which exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage available under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us from third parties may not be adequate to protect us against the financial impact of the related claims we also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor financial condition 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses operating results andor future performance 

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation andor benefits costs if we are unable to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance 

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance the succession plans we have in place and our employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent thirdparty brokers consultants and agents new distribution channels create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result of the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling our products 

our products are sold primarily through our sales personnel who frequently work with independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent brokers consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend andor market health care benefits products of our competitors accordingly we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sales personnel and thirdparty brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels this risk is heightened as we develop operate and expand our consumeroriented products and services and we expand in the health care space and our business model evolves to include a greater focus on consumers and directtoconsumer sales such as competing for sales on insurance exchanges 

new distribution channels for our products and services continue to emerge including private exchanges operated by health care consultants and technology companies these channels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their health care benefits in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplace entrants that could interfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas 

in addition there have been several investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive these investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practices which could adversely affect our ability to market our products 

failure of our businesses to effectively collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results 

to maximize our overall enterprise value our various businesses need to collaborate effectively our businesses need to be aligned in order to prioritize goals and coordinate the design of new products intended to utilize the offerings of multiple businesses including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs in addition misaligned incentives information siloes ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures for example significant financial decisions being made at an inappropriate level in our organization also could prevent us from maximizing our operating results andor achieving our financial and other projections 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses could adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches cyber attacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in us and foreign laws and regulations including privacy and information security laws and standards may cause us to incur significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

our business success and operating results depend in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing customer loyalty and subscription programs finance and other processes throughout our operations we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of confidential and sensitive data and information including personally identifiable information and protected health information that our customers members and other constituents provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 

we have many different information and other technology systems supporting our businesses including as a result of our acquisitions our businesses depend in large part on these systems to adequately price our products and services accurately establish reserves process claims and report operating results and interact with providers employer plan sponsors customers members consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices certain of our technology systems including software are older legacy systems that are less flexible less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resources to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems we must reengineer and reduce the number of these systems to meet changing consumer and vendor preferences and needs improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses we also need to develop or acquire new technology systems contract with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumeroriented and transformation products and services we are developing operating and expanding andor to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standards including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats if we fail to achieve these objectives our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

in addition information technology and other technology and process improvement projects including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we 

expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced systems we could among other things have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimates andor establishing appropriate pricing meeting the needs of customers consumers providers members and vendors developing and expanding our consumeroriented products and services or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these vendors are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems we use if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our operating results 

both our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating results 

we and our vendors are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks including natural disasters utility and other mechanical failures acts of war or terrorism acts of civil unrest disruption of communications data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulties the occurrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect our operations we also may be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such events although we have developed procedures for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and as a result our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our businesses in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans may not be effective should any such hazards or risks occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

we would be adversely affected if we do not effectively deploy our capital  downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could adversely affect our brand and reputation businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our operations generate significant capital and we have the ability to raise additional capital the manner in which we deploy our capital including investments in our businesses our operations such as information technology and other strategic and capital projects dividends acquisitions share andor debt repurchases repayment of debt reinsurance or other capital uses impacts our financial strength claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughout our industries our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds we believe our credit ratings and the financial strength and claims paying ability of our principal insurance and hmo subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our health care benefits products to certain of our customers 

each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future in connection with the completion of the aetna acquisition each of standard  poor’s moody’s and 

fitch downgraded certain of our debt financial strength andor other credit ratings downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

goodwill and other intangible assets could in the future become impaired 

as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 we had 1107 billion and 1129 billion respectively of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelylived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate industrywide changes changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

adverse conditions in the us and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities mortgage loans alternative investments and other investments and our operating results andor our financial condition 

the global capital markets including credit markets continue to experience volatility and uncertainty as an insurer we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the us as a result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the us and to a lesser extent the international financial markets and volatility uncertainty andor disruptions in the global capital markets particularly the us credit markets and governments’ monetary policy particularly us monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our operating results andor our financial condition by 

• significantly reducing the value andor liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results andor unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders’ equity 

• keeping interest rates low on highquality shortterm or mediumterm debt securities such as we have experienced during recent years and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities 

• reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise 

• causing nonperformance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties including customers issuers of securities in our investment portfolio mortgage borrowers andor reinsurance andor derivatives counterparties 

• making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities for example if trading becomes less frequent which could lead to significant periodtoperiod changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause periodtoperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders’ equity 

• reducing our ability to issue shortterm debt securities at attractive interest rates thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating results and 

• reducing our ability to issue other securities 

although we seek within guidelines we deem appropriate to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures a failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstances our cash flows 

we have incurred and assumed significant indebtedness which has increased our consolidated interest expense and could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

in order to complete the aetna acquisition we incurred acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 450 billion and assumed aetna’s existing indebtedness with a fair value of approximately 81 billion our substantial indebtedness and elevated debttoequity ratio have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense compared to preaetna acquisition periods in addition the amount of 

cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the aetna acquisition we have suspended share repurchases until we reach our desired debttoequity ratio the increased levels of indebtedness also could reduce funds available to engage in investments in product development capital expenditures dividend payments and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

risks related to our relationships with manufacturers providers suppliers and vendors 

we face risks relating to the market availability pricing suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell 

our retailltc segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs our pbm business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members as a result we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers we acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers certain of our agreements with such suppliers are shortterm and cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could adversely affect our prescription drug supply and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and financial condition moreover many products distributed by our pharmacies are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in some cases we depend upon a single source of supply any such supply shortages or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade regulations could adversely affect our businesses 

our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control if our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery including as a result of supply shortages supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with providers on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networks with high quality providers 

we are seeking to enhance our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risksharing arrangements with providers providers’ willingness to enter these arrangements with us depends upon among other things our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these valuebased contracts these arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our members these arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies target new customer groups increase membership and reduce medical costs and if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative sources if such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customers may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership and our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

while we believe joint ventures accountable care organizations “acos” and other nontraditional health care provider organizational structures present opportunities for us the implementation of our joint ventures and other nontraditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows among other things joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rates that make the joint ventures economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the 

operation and management of the joint ventures we may not be able to achieve these objectives in one or more of our joint ventures which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

if our service providers fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation andor regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs 

we contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems our arrangements with these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations for example certain of our vendors have been responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members and employees which has caused us to incur additional expenses and given rise to regulatory actions and litigation against us 

these risks are particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs where third parties perform medical management and other member related services for us any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policies data security andor cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceedings prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions fines sanctions andor penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we may experience increased medical and other benefit costs litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not have contracts with us render services to our health care benefits members 

some providers that render services to our health care benefits members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with these providers as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example in october 2018 an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately 150 million in a proceeding relating to aetna’s outofnetwork benefit payment and administration practices and in march 2019 that award was reduced to approximately 86 million such disputes may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs make it difficult for us to compete in certain geographies and create new competitors 

hospitals and other providers and health systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and has the potential to improve the delivery of health care services it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies these health systems also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us a process that has been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaidonly acos developed as a result of state medicaid laws practice management companies consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other providers adopt continues to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate these changes may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs and may require us to change our operations including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses or are unable to collaborate or contract with providers on acceptable terms each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and operating results

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted the economies of the us and other countries around the world beginning in march 2020 the effects of the covid19 pandemic began to emerge in the us the company executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of its operations including transitioning many officebased colleagues to a remote work environment and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies the company also provided enhanced benefits to its colleagues including bonuses to frontline colleagues dependent care financial assistance paid sick leave for parttime colleagues and paid time off to colleagues who test positive or are quarantined due to exposure to covid19 our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country enabled us to play an indispensable role in the national response to covid19 as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they needed us in our cvs locations in their homes and virtually the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on the company’s operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily in the company’s health care benefits and retailltc segments 

health care benefits segment 

beginning in midmarch the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services “utilization” that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures utilization remained below historical levels through april began to recover in may and june and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters with select geographies impacted by covid19 waves 

in response to covid19 the company expanded benefit coverage to its members these expanded benefits included costsharing waivers for covid19 related treatments as well as assistance to members through premium credits telehealth costsharing waivers and other investments 

covid19 also resulted in a shift in the company’s medical membership during the year the company experienced declines in commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers substantially offset by increases in medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment 

retailltc segment 

during march 2020 the company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the covid19 pandemic beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year the company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and minuteclinic locations due to shelterinplace orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased longterm care prescription volume as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition the company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the company’s covid19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products 

during 2020 the company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates the company offered covid19 diagnostic testing at more than 4000 cvs pharmacy locations as of december 31 2020 in addition the company launched critical diagnostic testing for the vulnerable senior population in longterm care facilities in partnership with three states the company was also selected to administer covid19 vaccines in both longterm care facilities and its retail pharmacies the company began administering covid19 vaccinations in longterm care facilities and in certain of its retail pharmacies during december 2020 and february 2021 respectively and expects to play a significant role in covid19 vaccine administration in the future 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve we believe covid19’s impact on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to the pandemic those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material

outlook for 2021 

with respect to 2021 the company believes you should consider the following important information 

• the pharmacy services segment is expected to benefit from continued growth in specialty pharmacy and our ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics partially offset by continued price compression 

• the retailltc segment is expected to benefit from increased prescription volume diagnostic testing and improved generic drug purchasing partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and operating expenses associated with the company’s covid19 pandemic response efforts the projected adjusted prescription growth is expected to be driven by the continued successful execution of our patient care programs the anticipated return of provider visits as we move through the year and vaccination administration while lower front store traffic has persisted into the first quarter of 2021 we expect front store traffic to increase as we move through the year 

• the health care benefits segment is expected to benefit from medicare membership growth partially offset by membership declines in our medicaid products the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the removal of the hif the projected mbr is expected to increase compared to 2020 reflecting the return to more normal levels of utilization the removal of the hif lower medicare risk adjustment revenue and the continued shift in business mix the covid19 pandemic is expected to adversely impact earnings in 2021 due to the regulatory changes included in the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 testing treatment and vaccination costs and lower medicare risk adjustment revenue 

• the company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprisewide cost savings initiatives that are expected to ramp as we move through the year key drivers include 

◦ the ongoing digitalization of our business along with technology improvements in our operations 

◦ office real estate reductions associated with workforce management changes and 

◦ productivityoperational efficiency initiatives within each of the company’s segments 

• based upon current tax legislation the company expects its effective income tax rate to decrease primarily due to the removal of the hif in 2021 

• the company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the company’s businesses 

the company’s current expectations described above are forwardlooking statements please see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this 10k and the “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” in this 10k for information regarding important factors that may cause the company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected andor otherwise materially affect the company

solvency regulation 

the national association of insurance commissioners the “naic” utilizes riskbased capital “rbc” standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weaklycapitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus the “rbc ratio” the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies within certain ratio ranges regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases there are four levels of regulatory action ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control at december 31 2020 the rbc ratio of each of the company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action the rbc framework described above for insurers has been extended by the naic to health organizations including hmos although not all states had adopted these rules at december 31 2020 at that date each of the company’s active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or where adopted the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic’s rbc rules external rating agencies use their own capital models andor rbc standards when they determine a company’s rating

revenue recognition 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the company’s retail pharmacy network the company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time pbm services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs 

the company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members the company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related pbm services 

revenues include i the portion of the price the client pays directly to the company net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client see “drug discounts” and “guarantees” below ii the price paid to the company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions “retail copayments” and iii claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts sales taxes are not included in revenues 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs the company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the pharmacy services segment 

• revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member at the time of delivery the company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments 

• revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the company’s pointofsale which is when the claim is adjudicated by the company’s online claims processing system and the company has transferred control of the prescription drug and performed all of its performance obligations 

for contracts under which the company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member revenue is recognized using the net method 

drug discounts 

the company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brandname formulary drugs the company estimates these rebates at periodend based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients the estimates are based on the best available data at periodend 

and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client the company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

guarantees 

the company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

retailltc segment 

retail pharmacy 

the company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise for pharmacy sales each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined valuebased service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

revenue from company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers ie breakage are recognized based on historical redemption patterns 

customer returns are not material to the company’s operating results or financial condition sales taxes are not included in revenues 

loyalty and other programs 

the company’s customer loyalty program extracare ®  consists of two components extrasavings tm and extrabucks ® rewards extrasavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level 

extrabucks rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels thus the company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction the company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the extrabucks rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards revenue allocated to extrabucks rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed at the end of each period unredeemed extrabucks rewards are reflected as a contract liability 

the company also offers a subscriptionbased membership program carepass ®  under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the company delivering the goods and services revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied 

longterm care 

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the company separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements a significant portion of longterm care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal medicare part d program and to a lesser extent state medicaid programs the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources as well as longterm care facilities and other third party insurance payors and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated 

differences between billed and reimbursed amounts accordingly the total revenues and receivables reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors 

patient copayments associated with medicare part d certain state medicaid programs medicare part b and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures 

walkin medical clinics 

for services provided by the company’s walkin medical clinics revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates 

health care benefits segment 

health care benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers revenue is recognized based on customer billings which reflect contracted rates per employee and the number of covered employees recorded in the company’s records at the time the billings are prepared billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month 

the company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors these adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments in each period the company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly as information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known the company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise a significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the company’s operating results 

premium revenue 

premiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts additionally premium revenue subject to the mlr rebate requirements of the aca is recorded net of the estimated minimum mlr rebates for the current calendar year premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods unearned premiums are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned 

some of the company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of insured members such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract 

services revenue 

services revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations the health care benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of asc fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for asc members asc fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided some of the company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions such as customer service response time claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range with any of these guarantees the company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the company by the customer involved each period the company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues 

accounting for medicare part d 

revenues include insurance premiums earned by the company’s pdps which are determined based on the pdp’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms the insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium which is the responsibility of the pdp member and can be subsidized by cms in the case of lowincome members and a direct premium paid by cms premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 

revenues also include a risksharing feature of the medicare part d program design referred to as the risk corridor the company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to or receivable from cms under the risk corridor and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to cms at the end of the reporting year 

in addition to medicare part d premiums the company receives additional payments each month from cms related to catastrophic reinsurance lowincome costsharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits if the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable net or accrued expenses 

impairments of debt securities 

the company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company bifurcates the impairment into creditrelated and noncredit related components the amount of the creditrelated component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income and the amount of the noncredit related component is included in other comprehensive income the company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

in evaluating whether a credit related loss exists the company considers a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security an industry or geographic area the payment structure of the security the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded yieldrelated impairment losses on debt securities of 49 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the company did not record creditrelated impairment losses on debt securities during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded otherthantemporary impairment “otti” losses on debt securities of 24 million there were no material otti losses on debt securities for the year ended december 31 2018 

the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the company’s assessment may change with the passage of time unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods 

vendor allowances and purchase discounts 

vendor and manufacturer receivables were 98 billion and 79 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased contractual arrangements with vendors including manufacturers wholesalers and retail pharmacies normally provide for the pharmacy services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one or a combination of the following forms i a direct discount at the time of purchase ii a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or iii when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy a discount or rebate paid subsequent to dispensing these rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter historically the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition the company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed the pharmacy services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes in addition the pharmacy services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 

retailltc segment 

vendor allowances received by the retailltc segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs andor other services provided amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are 

recognized as a reduction of advertising expense included in operating expenses when the related advertising commitment is satisfied any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straightline basis over the life of the related contract 

the company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data the majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter historically adjustments to the company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

there have not been any material changes in the way the company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years 

inventory 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method 

the value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and ltc pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated the company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts when estimating these losses a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a locationbylocation basis and current physical inventory loss trends 

the total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was 369 million and 401 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses it is possible that actual results could differ in order to help investors assess the aggregate risk if any associated with the inventoryrelated uncertainties discussed above a ten percent 10 pretax change in estimated inventory losses which is a reasonably likely change would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately 37 million as of december 31 2020 

although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 

rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments as the interest rate implicit in the company’s leases is not readily determinable the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate determined by class of underlying asset to discount the lease payments the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives 

the company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each for real estate leases the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy generally the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the rightofuse asset and lease liability similarly renewal options are not included in the lease term for nonreal estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets and lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the shortterm lease 

for real estate leases the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

longlived asset impairment 

recoverability of definitelived assets 

the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets excluding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the company groups and evaluates these longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified if indicators of impairment are present the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges if required an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 

the longlived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales profitability and cash flows when preparing these estimates the company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales profitability and cash flow results and forecasts these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs andor increased member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns 

there were no material impairment charges recognized on longlived assets in the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded store rationalization charges of 231 million primarily related to operating lease rightofuse asset impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2018 the company recognized a 43 million longlived asset impairment charge primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment 

recoverability of goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value or carrying amount including goodwill the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the net book value carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates these assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes discount rates terminal growth rates and forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization income taxes capital expenditures and future working capital requirements when determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates the company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends consolidated revenues profitability and cash flow results and forecasts and industry trends the company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions the riskfree interest rate environment the company’s market capitalization efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs including their prescription drug costs andor increase member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share consumer spending patterns and the company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives 

2020 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins with the 

exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6 and 12 respectively 

in connection with the aetna acquisition in november 2018 the company added the health care benefits segment which included the commercial business reporting unit the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition as a result at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit was equal to its carrying value 

the company has experienced declines in its commercial insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the aetna acquisition and may continue to do so for a number of reasons including as a result of the competitive commercial business environment in addition covid19 has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on medical membership in the commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers including due to business failures as well as reduced willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers the company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership revenue growth rate operating income and the discount rate although the company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable and achievable the challenges described above may affect the company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the commercial business reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so as of december 31 2020 the goodwill balance in the commercial business reporting unit was 265 billion 

the ltc reporting unit continues to experience industrywide challenges that have impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the company acquired omnicare in 2015 those challenges included lower client retention rates lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018 and continued facility reimbursement pressures covid19 has also had an adverse impact on the financial health of the company’s longterm care facility customers due to declines in occupancy rates and increased operating expenses a number of these customers have relied on supplemental liquidity sources such as grants and advance medicare payments under programs expanded or created under the cares act to maintain adequate liquidity during the covid19 pandemic and may require additional sources of liquidity throughout the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

although the company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the ltc reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable and achievable the ltc reporting unit has faced challenges that affect the company’s ability to grow the ltc reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so these challenges and some of the key assumptions included in the company’s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of the ltc reporting unit include client retention rates occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities the financial health of skilled nursing facility customers facility reimbursement pressures the company’s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of covid19 covid19’s impact on health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to covid19 the fair value of the ltc reporting unit also is dependent on market multiples of peer group companies and the riskfree interest rate environment which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow valuation method if the ltc reporting unit does not achieve its forecasts it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the ltc reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount as of december 31 2020 the goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit was 431 million 

the covid19 pandemic severely impacted global economic activity in 2020 including the businesses of some of the company’s customers and during the first half of the year caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the capital markets in addition to adversely affecting the company’s businesses which may have a material adverse impact on the company’s profitability and cash flows these developments may adversely affect the timing and collectability of payments to the company from customers clients government payers and members as a result of the impact of covid19 on them for further information regarding the potential adverse impact of covid19 on the company please see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this report the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve we believe covid19’s impact on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and the timing scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal state and local governmental responses to the pandemic those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control as a result the impact covid19 will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material covid19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations and claims against 

us if the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows are materially adversely affected the goodwill of the ltc and commercial business reporting units could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount 

2019 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4 and 9 respectively 

2018 goodwill impairment tests 

as discussed in note 5 ‘‘goodwill and other intangibles’’ included in item 8 of this 10k during 2018 the ltc reporting unit experienced industrywide challenges that impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the company acquired omnicare and when the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed those challenges include lower client retention rates lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018 and continued facility reimbursement pressures following the update of its current and longterm forecast in june 2018 management determined that there were indicators that the ltc reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of june 30 2018 the results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in a 39 billion pretax goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2018 

during the third quarter of 2018 the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill the goodwill impairment tests showed that the fair values of the pharmacy services and retail pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair value of the ltc reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 2 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the ltc reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues including one significant customer bankruptcy additionally ltc management submitted updated projected financial results which showed significant additional deterioration primarily due to continued industry and operational challenges which also caused management to make further updates to its longterm forecast beyond 2019 based on these updated projections management determined that there were indicators that the ltc reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018 the results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in an additional 22 billion pretax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 

in 2018 the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method in addition to the lower financial projections changes in riskfree interest rates and lower market multiples of peer group companies also contributed to the amount of the 2018 goodwill impairment charges 

recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset the company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions availability of market information and the profitability of the company there were no impairment losses recognized on indefinitelived intangible assets in any of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 or 2018 

health care costs payable 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 77 and 73 respectively of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of i services rendered to the company’s insured members but not yet reported to the company and ii claims which have been 

reported to the company but not yet paid collectively “ibnr” health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements the remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments the company develops its estimate of ibnr using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information on the company’s reserving methodology 

during 2020 and 2019 the company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end after considering the claims paid in 2020 and 2019 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 4 and 27 basis points higher respectively than previously estimated resulting in a decrease of 35 million and 240 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively in health care costs payable that related to the prior year the company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of ibnr as of december 31 2020 however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 11 basis points from the company’s assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus 140 million pretax 

also during 2020 and 2019 the company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated specifically after considering the claims paid in 2020 and 2019 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed health care costs that were 40 and 32 lower respectively for each fourth quarter than previously estimated resulting in a reduction of 394 million and 284 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively in health care costs payable that related to prior year 

management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates when establishing reserves as of december 31 2020 the company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 96 from health care cost trend rates recently observed assumed health care cost trend rates during the fourth quarter of 2020 are elevated compared to historical levels due to the impact of covid19 pandemic on utilization during 2020 specifically beginning in midmarch the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures utilization remained below historical levels through april began to recover in may and june and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters with select geographies impacted by covid19 waves based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 35 from the assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus 404 million pretax 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted regardless of when they are effective deferred tax assets are reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain additionally the company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority interest andor penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions the company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals as warranted due to changing facts and circumstances

see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the company 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk credit quality risk market valuation risk foreign currency risk commodity risk and operational risk 

evaluation of interest rate and credit quality risk 

the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate the company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio in connection with its investment and risk management objectives the company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by among other things levels of or changes in interest rates shortterm or longterm duration prepayment rates equity markets or credit ratingsspreads the company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps treasury rate locks forward contracts futures contracts warrants put options and credit default swaps these instruments viewed separately subject the company to varying degrees of interest rate equity price and credit risk however when used for hedging the company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk 

investments 

the company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at december 31 2020 and 2019 



investment risks associated with experiencerated products generally do not impact the company’s operating results the risks associated with investments supporting experiencerated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the company’s corporateother segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the company subject to among other things certain minimum guarantees assets supporting experiencerated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals 

the debt securities in the company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of a at both december 31 2020 and 2019 with approximately 63 billion and 44 billion rated aaa at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the debt securities that were rated below investment grade that is having a credit quality rating below bbbbaa3 were 19 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively of which 2 and 4 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively supported experiencerated products 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company held 321 million and 333 million respectively of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties representing 2 of total investments at both december 31 2020 and 2019 these securities had an average credit quality rating of aa at both december 31 2020 and 2019 with the guarantee these securities had an average credit quality rating of a and a at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively without the guarantee the company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors either direct or indirect 

the company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets at both december 31 2020 and 2019 less than 1 of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the company’s assumptions categorized as level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america see note 4 ‘‘fair value’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments for additional information related to investments see note 3 ‘‘investments’’ included in item 8 of this 10k 

the company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company bifurcates the impairment into creditrelated and noncredit related components the amount of the creditrelated component is recorded as an allowance 

for credit losses and recognized in net income and the amount of the noncredit related component is included in other comprehensive income the impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy see ‘‘critical accounting policies  impairments of debt securities” in the mda included in item 7 of this 10k for additional information 

evaluation of market valuation risks 

the company regularly evaluates its risk from marketsensitive instruments by examining among other things levels of or changes in interest rates shortterm or longterm duration prepayment rates equity markets andor credit ratingsspreads the company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to managementapproved investment guidelines and operates within those guidelines and the business objectives of its portfolios 

on a quarterly basis the company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the company’s consolidated nearterm financial condition operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in nearterm market rates and prices interest rate changes whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors represent the most material risk exposure category for the company the company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios the assumptions used were as follows an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates which the company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario for longterm debt issued by the company as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15 in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities 

assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at december 31 2020 is as follows 

• the fair value of longterm debt issued by the company would decline by approximately 53 billion 67 billion pretax changes in the fair value of longterm debt do not impact the company’s operating results or financial condition 

• the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately 490 million 615 million pretax related to continuing nonexperiencerated products reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity as the company classifies these debt securities as available for sale the company does not record liabilities at fair value 

if the value of the company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities were to decline by 15 this would result in a net decline in fair value of 5 million 7 million pretax 

based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk the company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated nearterm financial condition operating results or cash flows as of december 31 2020 

evaluation of foreign currency and commodity risk 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 55 and 61 respectively of the company’s investment portfolio was comprised of investments that have exposure to the oil and gas industry with more than half that amount comprised of investment grade rated debt securities these exposures are experiencing varied degrees of financial strains in the current depressed oil and gas price environment and the likelihood of the company’s portfolio incurring additional realized capital losses on these exposures may increase if such depressed prices persist andor decline further 

evaluation of operational risks 

the company also faces certain operational risks those risks include risks related to the covid19 pandemic and risks related to information security including cybersecurity 

the spread of covid19 or actions taken to mitigate its spread could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages disruptions in our supply chains our distribution chains andor public and private infrastructure including communications financial services and supply chains could materially and adversely impact our business operations we have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 as have a significant number of our thirdparty service providers which may amplify certain risks to our businesses including an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of phishing and other cyber attacks increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other thirdparties and increased risk of business interruptions 

the company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward as examples the company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems denial of service attacks attempted malware infections account takeovers scanning activity and phishing emails attacks can originate from external criminals terrorists nation states or internal actors the company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage the impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the company’s operations or operating results through december 31 2020 the board and its audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are regularly informed regarding the company’s information security policies practices and status

government regulation 

overview 

the company’s operations are subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which it does business there also continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by federal state and international regulators of the health and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices in addition many of the company’s pbm clients and the company’s payors in the retailltc segment including insurers medicare part d plans managed medicaid plans and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor similarly the company’s ltc clients such as skilled nursing facilities are subject to government regulations including many of the same government regulations to which the company is subject 

the laws and rules governing the company’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the company’s businesses creates areas of uncertainty further there are numerous proposed health care financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal state and international levels some of which could adversely affect the company’s businesses if they are enacted the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings including fundamental changes to the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which it competes such as the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring the commercial medicare or medicaid marketplace or reducing payments to the company under or financing for medicare medicaid dual eligible or special needs programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation or changing the laws governing pbms will change various aspects of the industries in which it competes or the health care industry generally or the impact those changes will have on the company’s businesses operating results cash flows andor stock price but the effects could be materially adverse any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations summarized below or any adverse applications or interpretations of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting the company andor its businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results financial condition cash flows andor stock price see item 3 of this 10k “legal proceedings” for further information 

the company can give no assurance that its businesses financial condition operating results andor cash flows will not be materially adversely affected or that the company will not be required to materially change its business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to one or more of the company’s businesses one or more of the industries in which the company competes andor the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of one or more of the company’s businesses one or more of the industries in which the company competes andor the health care industry generally iv pending or future government audits investigations or enforcement actions against the company v adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against the company whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against the company or vi adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the company or affecting one or more of the industries in which the company competes andor the health care industry generally 

laws and regulations related to multiple segments of the company’s business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs  the company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims and other information to medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute state false claims acts and antikickback statutes in most states the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the false claims act prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs in addition any claim for government reimbursement also violates the false claims act where it results from a violation of the federal antikickback statute 

both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government participants in the health and related benefits industry including the company frequently are subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

the aca  the aca made broadbased changes to the us health care system while the company anticipates continued efforts in 2020 and beyond to invalidate modify repeal or replace the aca the company expects aspects of the aca to continue to significantly impact its business operations and operating results including pricing medical benefit ratios “mbrs” and the geographies in which the company’s products are available 

while most of the significant aspects of the aca became effective during or prior to 2014 parts of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive orders legislation regulations and guidance as well as ongoing litigation additional changes to the aca and those regulations and guidance at the federal andor state level are likely and those changes are likely to be significant growing federal and state budgetary pressures make it more likely that any changes including changes at the state level in response to changes to or invalidation repeal or replacement of the aca andor changes in the funding levels andor payment mechanisms of federally supported benefit programs will be adverse to us for example if any elements of the aca are invalidated or repealed at the federal level the company expects that some states would seek to enact similar requirements such as prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage requiring coverage for dependents up to age 26 requiring guaranteed renewability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limits on insurance coverage 

the expansion of health care coverage contemplated by the aca is being funded in part by reductions to the reimbursements the company and other health plans are paid by the federal government for medicare members among other sources while not allinclusive the following are some of the key funding changes related to the aca assuming it continues to be implemented in its current form that become effective on or after january 1 2020 the company continues to evaluate these provisions and the related regulations and regulatory guidance to determine the impact that they will have on its business operations and operating results 

 

the aca also specifies minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for commercial and medicare insured products specifies features required to be included in commercial benefit designs limits commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new participants to enter the marketplace and significantly increases federal and state oversight of health plans including regulations and processes that could delay or limit the company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates this in turn could adversely affect the company’s ability to continue to participate in certain product lines andor geographies that it serves today 

potential repeal of the aca ongoing legislative regulatory and administrative policy changes to the aca the results of federal and state level elections pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of the aca or funding for the law and federal budget negotiations continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the aca the time frame for conclusion and final outcome and ultimate impact of this litigation are uncertain given the inherent difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future changes to the aca and how states businesses and individuals will respond to those changes the company cannot predict the impact on it of future changes to the aca it is reasonably possible that invalidation repeal or replacement of or other changes to the aca andor states’ responses to such changes in the aggregate could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s businesses operating results and cash flows 

medicare regulation  the company’s medicare advantage products compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage products offered by other medicare advantage organizations and medicare supplement products offered by other insurers the company’s medicare pdp and medicare supplement products are products that medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage 

the company continues to expand the number of counties in which it offers medicare products the company expects to further expand its medicare service area and products in 2020 and is seeking to substantially grow its medicare membership revenue and operating results over the next several years including through growth in medicare supplement products the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare products offered and the medicarerelated provisions of the aca significantly increase the company’s exposure to funding and regulation of and changes in government policy with respect to andor funding or regulation of the various medicare programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs andor new reforms or surcharges on existing programs for example the aca requires minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans of 85 if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms 

the company’s medicare advantage and pdp products are heavily regulated by cms the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other private participants in medicare programs are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example in the second quarter of 2014 cms issued a final rule implementing the aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation payments the company receives from cms for its medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services the “oig” and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the amount of the company’s medicare reimbursement require the company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit the company’s and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare standards and its medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms may seek premium and other refunds prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to passively enroll members in one or more of the company’s medicare or medicaremedicaid demonstration historically known as “dual eligible” plans exclude us from participating in one or more medicare dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms regulations or its medicare contractual requirements the company’s medicare supplement products are regulated at the state level and subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks 

cms regularly audits the company’s performance to determine its compliance with cms’s regulations and its contracts with cms and to assess the quality of services it provides to medicare advantage and pdp beneficiaries for example cms conducts risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits of a subset of medicare advantage contracts for each contract year since 2013 cms has selected certain of the company’s medicare advantage contracts for various years for radv audit and the number of radv audits continues to increase the oig also is auditing the company’s risk adjustment data and that of other companies and the company expects cms and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data the company also has received civil investigative demands “cids” from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of its patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program 

on october 26 2018 cms issued proposed rules related to among other things changes to the radv audit methodology established by cms in 2012 cms projects that the changes to the radv audit methodology would increase its recoveries from medicare advantage plans as a result of radv audits cms has requested comments on the proposed rules including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audits of medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward the company is evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on the company’s operating results financial condition and cash flows if the proposed radv rule change were adopted as proposed cms also has announced that its goal is to subject all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year 

a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings” the star rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by cms including quality of preventative services chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of four or more stars out of five stars are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates as a result the company’s medicare advantage plans’ operating results in 2020 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings the company’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its medicare operations cms released the company’s 2020 star ratings in october 2019 the company’s 2020 star ratings will be used to determine which of its medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2021 based on the company’s membership at december 31 2019 83 of the company’s medicare advantage members were in plans with 2020 star ratings of at least 40 stars cms will release updated stars ratings in october 2020 that will be used to determine which medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2022 cms also gives pdps star ratings which affect pdp’s enrollment medicare advantage and pdp plans that are rated less than three stars for three consecutive years are subject to contract termination by cms cms continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve four stars or more despite the company’s success in achieving high 2020 star ratings and other quality measures and the continuation of its improvement efforts there can be no assurances that it will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years accordingly the company’s medicare advantage plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

overall the company projects the benchmark payment rates in cms’s april 2019 final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rates for 2020 the “final notice” will increase funding for the company’s medicare advantage business excluding the impact of the hif by approximately 20 in 2020 compared to 2019 this 2020 rate increase only partially offsets the challenge the company faces from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications and cms local and national coverage decisions that require the company to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into the company’s bids the federal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for medicare advantage andor pdp plans or otherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products the company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the company’s continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp programs although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change 

going forward the company expects cms the oig the doj other federal agencies and the us congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdp demonstration projects such as medicaremedicaid plans and provider network access and adequacy modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ role it is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity any of which could materially and adversely affect the company 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs companies involved in public health care programs such as medicare andor medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud waste and abuse and are often the subject of fraud waste and abuse investigations and audits the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare and medicaid program standards ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the company’s compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources 

antitrust and unfair competition  the us federal trade commission “ftc” investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand name drug pricing and rebate practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that the company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy cvs specialty or minuteclinic plays a unique or expanded role in a pbm or health care benefits segment product offering the company’s business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state andor federal regulators andor private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of the company’s activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by the company of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii the company uses and discloses deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use andor disclosure of pii 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” as further modified by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” further arra requires the company and other covered entities to report any breaches of phi to impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services “hhs” and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to phi criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of arra amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi the hitech act also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates hhs has begun to audit health plans providers and other parties to enforce hipaa compliance including with respect to data security 

in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa including laws that place stricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access to phi states also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the financial modernization act of 1999 also known as the grammleachbliley act “glba” which generally require insurers including health insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a nonaffiliated third party like hipaa glba sets a “floor” standard allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the company has made to comply with hipaa and glba 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry in addition states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access deletion protection or transparency such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” states also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity such as the regulations issued by the new york department of financial services complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations which may differ from state to state requires significant resources in addition differing approaches to state privacy andor cybersecurity regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines widelyreported large scale commercial data breaches in the united states and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states these legislative and regulatory developments will impact the design and operation of the company’s businesses its privacy and security strategy and its webbased and mobile assets 

finally each public exchange is required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the public exchange has implemented for itself or non 

public exchange entities which include insurers offering plans through the public exchange and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws  the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the federal trade commission act the federal postal service act the consumer product safety act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws in addition the federal government and most states have adopted laws andor regulations requiring places of public accommodation health care services and other goods and services to be accessible to people with disabilities these consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care products and services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities as a result of the company’s directtoconsumer activities including mobile and webbased solutions offered to members and to other consumers the company also is subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations for example the ccpa became effective in 2020 and additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection may be proposed or enacted in 2020 the company expects these new laws and regulations to impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliance costs 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc the federal communications commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions

state insurance hmo and insurance holding company regulation  a number of states regulate affiliated groups of insurers and hmos such as the company under holding company statutes these laws may among other things require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany transfers of assets and transactions between the regulated companies and their affiliates including their parent holding companies the company expects the states in which its insurance and hmo subsidiaries are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control activities of its insurance companies and hmos changes to state insurance hmo andor insurance holding company laws or regulations or changes to the interpretation of those laws or regulations including due to regulators’ increasing concerns regarding insurance company andor hmo solvency due among other things to past and expected payor insolvencies could negatively affect the company’s businesses in various ways including through increases in solvency fund assessments requirements that the company hold greater levels of capital andor delays in approving dividends from regulated subsidiaries 

pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

the states of domicile of the company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory riskbased capital or “rbc” requirements for health and other insurance companies and hmos based on the national association of insurance commissioners’ riskbased capital rbc for insurers model act the “rbc model act” these rbc requirements are intended to assess the capital 

adequacy of life and health insurers and hmos taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products the rbc model act sets forth the formula for calculating rbc requirements which are designed to take into account asset risks insurance risks interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business in general under these laws an insurance company or hmo must submit a report of its rbc level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year at december 31 2019  the rbc level of each of the company’s insurance and hmo subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action 

for information regarding restrictions on certain payments of dividends or other distributions by the company’s hmo and insurance company subsidiaries see note 12 ‘‘shareholders’ equity’’ included in item 8 of this 10k 

the holding company laws for the states of domicile of certain of the company’s subsidiaries also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company such as the company’s ultimate parent company cvs health that controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of another person

health savings accounts health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax fee and subsidy provisions of the aca also are regulated by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service 

the company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability federal and state courts including the us supreme court continue to consider cases and federal and state regulators continue to issue regulations and interpretations addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims the scope of erisa’s fiduciary duty requirements the scope of the false claims act and the preemptive effect of erisa on state laws

international regulation  the company has insurance licenses in several foreign jurisdictions and does business directly or through local affiliations in numerous countries around the world the company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve 

customers in the european economic area following the united kingdom’s exit from the eu “brexit” however the impact of brexit on the company’s international business and operating results is uncertain 

the company’s international operations are subject to different and sometimes more stringent legal and regulatory requirements which vary widely by jurisdiction including anticorruption laws economic sanctions laws various privacy insurance tax tariff and trade laws and regulations corporate governance privacy data protection including the eu’s general data protection regulation which began to apply across the eu during 2018 data mining data transfer labor and employment intellectual property consumer protection and investment laws and regulations discriminatory licensing procedures compulsory cessions of reinsurance required localization of records and funds higher premium and income taxes limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership in addition the expansion of the company’s operations into foreign countries increases the company’s exposure to the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering provisions of us law including the fcpa and corresponding foreign laws including the uk bribery act 2010 the “uk bribery act” 

anticorruption laws  the fcpa prohibits offering promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage the company also is subject to applicable anticorruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates in many countries outside the united states health care professionals are employed by the government therefore the company’s dealings with them are subject to regulation under the fcpa violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and there continues to be a heightened level of fcpa enforcement activity by the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the doj the uk bribery act is an anticorruption law that is broader in scope than the fcpa and applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with the uk authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions the company has internal control policies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to deter prohibited practices however if the company’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations it may face investigations prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties administrative remedies and criminal sanctions

laws and regulations related to the pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation  legislation andor regulations seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect and the company’s ability to standardize its pbm products and services across state lines in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” and the national council of insurance legislators have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding 

pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm mail order pharmacy andor specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact the company’s health plan clients andor the services provided to those clients andor the company’s health plans 

the company’s pbm activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels including being subject to the false claims act and state false claims acts and federal and state antikickback laws these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern andor further restrict critical pbm practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers use of administration of andor changes to drug formularies maximum allowable cost “mac” list pricing average wholesale prices “awps” andor clinical programs the offering to plan sponsors of pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread” ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pbm and the price paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider disclosure of data to third parties drug utilization management practices the level of duty a pbm owes its customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of the company’s pharmacies including audits of its pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to members’ drug utilization and registration or licensing of pbms failure by the company or one of its pbm services suppliers to comply with these laws or regulations could result in material fines andor sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results andor cash flows 

the company’s pbm service contracts including those in which the company assumes certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of pbm activities due to legislation passing in a number of states requiring pbms to register or obtain a license with the department rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements pharmacy reimbursement for generics mac reimbursement and pharmacy audits  most of which fall under the state insurance code 

pharmacy network access legislation  medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s and its health plans’ and its health plan clients’ ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers for example certain “any willing provider” legislation may require the company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the company’s ability and the company’s and its client health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the company for payment these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the company identifies through pharmacy audits 

pharmacy pricing legislation  a number of states have passed legislation regulating the company’s ability to manage and establish macs for generic prescription drugs mac methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors including cms to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay for at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively affect the company’s ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

formulary and plan design regulation  a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under the aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state public exchanges additionally the naic and health care accreditation agencies like ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect the company’s ability to develop and administer formularies pharmacy networks and other plan design features on behalf of its insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

laws and regulations related to the retailltc segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its retailltc segment specifically among these are the following 

retail medical clinics  states regulate retail medical clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight clinic and lab licensure requirements and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail medical clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of the company’s owned and managed retail medical clinics 

other laws  other federal state and local laws and regulations also impact the company’s retail operations including laws and regulations governing the practice of optometry the practice of audiology the provision of dietician services and the sale of durable medical equipment contact lenses eyeglasses hearing aids and alcohol 

laws and regulations related to the health care benefits segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the company’s business the company is subject to federal state local and international statutes and regulations governing its health care benefits segment specifically 

overview  differing approaches to state insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its health care benefits products and services across state lines these laws and regulations including the aca restrict how the company conducts its business and result in additional burdens and costs to the company significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies underwriting rules and procedures required benefits sales and marketing activities provider rates of payment restrictions on health plans’ ability to limit providers’ participation in their networks andor remove providers from their networks and financial condition including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements these laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product 

each health insurer and hmo must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business in addition health insurers and hmos are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal applicable laws also restrict the ability of the company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends and certain dividends require prior regulatory approval in addition some of the company’s businesses and related activities may be subject to ppo managed care organization utilization review or tparelated licensure requirements and regulations these licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state but may contain provider network contracting product and rate financial and reporting requirements there also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the company’s delivery of services payment of claims fraud prevention protection of consumer health information and payment for covered benefits and services 

required regulatory approvals  the company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to price market and administer many of its health care benefits products supervisory agencies including cms the center for consumer information and insurance oversight and the dol as well as state health insurance managed care and medicaid agencies have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions 



 

the company’s operations current and past business practices current and past contracts and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine regular and special investigations audits examinations and reviews by and from time to time the company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from federal state and international supervisory and enforcement agencies attorneys general and other state federal and international governmental authorities and legislators 

commercial product pricing and underwriting restrictions  pricing and underwriting regulation by states limits the company’s underwriting and rating practices and those of other health insurers particularly for small employer groups and varies by state in general these limitations apply to certain customer segments and limit the company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups or both based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior claim experience in some states these laws and regulations restrict the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes andor reflect reasonable costs in the company’s pricing 

the aca expanded the premium rate review process by among other things requiring the company’s commercial insured rates to be reviewed for “reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level hhs established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate increases equal to or exceeding a federally or lower state specified threshold hhs’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as well as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold these combined state and federal review requirements may prevent further delay or otherwise affect the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes which could adversely affect its mbrs and operating results particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services andor medical cost trend or when such utilization andor trend exceeds the company’s projections 

the aca also specifies minimum mlrs of 85 for large group commercial products and 80 for individual and small group commercial products because the aca minimum mlrs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for commercial products states have and may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” incorporate minimum mlr requirements into prospective premium rate filings require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured commercial products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

in addition the company requested significant increases in its premium rates in its commercial health care benefits business for 2020 including as a result of the reinstatement of the hif for 2020 following the temporary suspension of the hif for 2019 and expects to continue to request increases in those rates for 2021 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and rating limits and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments including as a result of the aca the company’s rates also must be adequate to reflect adverse selection in its products particularly in small group commercial products which the company expects to continue and potentially worsen in 2020 these rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

many of the laws and regulations governing the company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other carriers may charge between new and renewal business andor between groups based on differing characteristics they may also require that carriers disclose to customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage 

medicaid regulation  the company is seeking to substantially grow its medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next several years as a result the company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to the company under those programs 

since 2017 managed medicaid products including those the company offers are subject to a minimum federal mlr of 85 a medicaid managed care quality rating system and provider network adequacy requirements also apply to medicaid products because the federal minimum mlr is structured as a “floor” states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions for managed medicaid products states may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured medicaid products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

the impact of medicaid expansion under the aca is uncertain the future of the aca is uncertain and states may opt out of the elements of the aca requiring expansion of medicaid coverage without losing their current federal medicaid funding to date a number of states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid coverage to the higher eligibility levels contemplated by the aca in addition the election of new governors andor state legislatures may impact states’ previous decisions regarding medicaid expansion proposals for substantial changes to federal funding of state medicaid programs are likely to be considered in 2020 and beyond including the possibility of converting federal medicaid support to block grants such as the block grant option outlined by cms on january 30 2020 and per capita caps on federal funding uncertainty regarding federal funding is causing and will continue to cause states to reevaluate their medicaid expansions and consider new assessments fees andor taxes on health plans that reevaluation and any changes to federal funding of state medicaid programs may adversely affect medicaid payment rates the company’s revenues and its medicaid membership 

the economic aspects of the medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change medicaid premiums are paid by each state and differ from state to state the federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation for medicaid and dual eligible program reforms or redesigns including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by medicaid mcos and their contracted pbms further program population andor geographic expansions of riskbased managed care increasing beneficiary costsharing or payment levels and changes to benefits reimbursement eligibility criteria provider network adequacy requirements including requiring the inclusion of specified high cost providers in the company’s networks and program structure in some states current medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not be adequate for the company to continue program participation the company’s medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states or sponsors of medicaid managed care plans are subject to cancellation by the state or the sponsors of the managed care plans after a short notice period without cause for example when a state discontinues a managed care program or in the event of insufficient state funding 

the company’s medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies which have the right to audit the company’s performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations the company’s medicaid products dual eligible products and chip contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services network requirements including mandatory inclusion of specified highcost providers and other aspects of these programs and by external review organizations which audit medicaid plans on behalf of state medicaid agencies the laws regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other participants in medicaid and dual eligible programs including requirements that the company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms andor state medicaid agencies may fine the company withhold payments to the company seek premium and other refunds terminate the company’s existing contracts elect not to award the company new contracts or not to renew the company’s existing contracts prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the company’s medicaid or dual eligible products exclude the company from participating in one or more medicaid or dual eligible programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms or state regulations or contractual requirements 

the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the medicaid program nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results but the effects could be materially adverse 

state workers’ compensation laws  the company’s workers’ compensation business includes the comparison of medical claims data against the applicable state’s fee schedule pricing including applicable regulations and clinical guidelines state fee schedules which typically represent the maximum reimbursement for medical services provided to the injured worker differ by state and change as state laws and regulations are passed andor amended the company’s workers’ compensation business also includes pbm and care management services both of which are regulated at the state level the company’s workers’ 

compensation customers include insurance carriers and tpas who also are regulated at the state level the laws and regulations applicable to the company and other participants in the workers’ compensation business are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its workers’ compensation compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources the company may be subject to significant fines penalties and litigation if it fails to comply with those laws and regulations 

federal and state reporting  the company is subject to extensive financial and business reporting requirements including penalties for inaccuracies andor omissions at both the federal and state level the company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from third parties that may not be readily available or reliably provided in all instances the company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to comply with these requirements however the company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailability of or errors in its reports 

product design and administration and sales practices  state andor federal regulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration and marketing and advertising practices including the filing of insurance policy forms the adequacy of provider networks the accuracy of provider directories and the adequacy of disclosure regarding products and their administration is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices medicare medicaid and dual eligible products and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny 

guaranty fund assessmentssolvency protection  under guaranty fund laws existing in all states insurers doing business in those states can be assessed in most states up to prescribed limits for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants the life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of longterm care insurers as well as health insurers the company’s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to the company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes some states have similar laws relating to hmos andor other payors such as notforprofit consumer governed health plans established under the aca while historically the company has ultimately recovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative andor regulatory actions that limit future offsets

risks relating to our businesses 

each of our segments operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment and gross margins in the industries in which we compete may decline 

each of our segments pharmacy services which includes our pharmacy benefit management “pbm” business retailltc and health care benefits operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment specifically 



to contain price increases despite being faced with increasing drug costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 

 

in addition competitors in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition also may come from new entrants and other sources in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in the rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such alterations and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example decisions to buy our pharmacy services and health care benefits products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers either through direct purchasing for example medicare advantage plans and pdps or through public health insurance exchanges “public exchanges” and private health insurance exchanges together with public exchanges collectively “insurance exchanges” that allow individual choice consumers also are increasingly seeking to access consumer goods and health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile devices and websites to compete effectively in the consumerdriven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences 

changes in marketplace dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and decisions to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor prospects 

a change in our health care benefits product mix may adversely affect our profit margins 

our insured health care benefits products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc products historically smaller employer groups have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures although over the last several years even relatively small employers have moved to asc products we also serve and expect to grow our business with governmentsponsored programs including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profit margins than our commercial insured health care benefits products a shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on the health care benefits segment’s operating results 

negative public perception of the industries in which we operate or of our industries’ or our practices can adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and prospects 

our brand and reputation are two of our most important assets and the industries in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public from time to time negative publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage litigation against us and other industry participants the ongoing public debates over drug pricing pbms government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing the future of the aca “surprise” medical bills governmental hearings andor investigations actual or perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products andor business practices including pbm operations drug pricing and insurance coverage determinations and social media and other media relations activities negative publicity also may come from a failure to meet customer expectations for consistent high quality and accessible care this risk may increase as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data and as our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumers 

negative public perception andor publicity of our industries in general or of us or our key vendors brokers or product distribution networks in particular can further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results and our stock price by 

 

we must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services including proprietary brands 

the success of our businesses depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and clients and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products we also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retail operations including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our retail business operating results cash flows andor financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affect our sales of products owned by 

our suppliers and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating results and erode customer loyalty 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business operating results and cash flows 

we face risks relating to the availability pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

the profitability of our retailltc and pharmacy services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products we dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacies and the retail pharmacies in our pbm’s network also dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs our revenues operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced due to 

 

in addition increased utilization of generic drugs which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 

a number of factors many of which are beyond our control contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs which could adversely affect our health care benefits segment’s operating results 

premiums for our insured health care benefits products which comprised 91 of our health care benefits revenues for 2019 are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period which is generally one year these forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and require a significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums as a result our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our operating results 

a number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs including previously uninsured members entering the health care system changes in members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes changes in the health status of our members the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics advances in medical technology increases in the number and 

cost of prescription drugs including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultrahigh cost drugs and therapies directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers the increasing influence of social media on our members’ health care utilization and other behaviors changes in health care practices and general economic conditions such as inflation and employment levels in addition governmentimposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time and future amendments or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include changes as a result of the aca changes to the aca and other changes in the regulatory environment the evolution toward a consumer driven business model new technologies influenza related health care costs which may be substantial and higher than we project clusters of highcost cases epidemics or pandemics health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control for example the 20192020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and has a higher incidence of influenza than the 20182019 influenza season and influenza related health care costs were higher than aetna projected in 20172018 

our health care benefits segment’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect the factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results 

the reserves we hold for expected claims in our insured health care benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited 

a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the aca’s the us centers for medicare  medicaid services’ “cms’s” and the federal office of personnel management’s “opm’s” minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” rules and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program 

our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns andor procedures turnover and other changes in membership changes in product mix changes in the utilization of medical andor other covered services including prescription drugs changes in medical cost trends changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products we estimate health care costs payable periodically and any resulting adjustments including premium deficiency reserves are reflected in currentperiod operating results within benefit costs for example as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we established a premium deficiency reserve of 4 million and 16 million respectively related to medicaid products in the health care benefits segment a worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of december 31 2019 would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results these risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical andor other covered services andor medical cost trends are below recent historical levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risks are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

our operating results are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve 

our businesses are affected by the us economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve including various economic factors including inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment could cause a decline in drug utilization an 

increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores 

if our customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing our customers may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition both state and federal government sponsored payers as a result of budget deficits or spending reductions may suspend payments or seek to reduce their health care expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us 

further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms and the value of our investment portfolio adverse changes in the us economy consumer confidence and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future andor decrease our prescription volumes 

in addition our health care benefits membership remains concentrated in certain us geographies and in certain industries unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefits segment’s operating results our health care benefits membership has been and may continue to be affected by workforce reductions by our customers due to adverse andor uncertain general economic conditions especially in the us geographies and industries where our membership is concentrated as a result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefits membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenues and operating results may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers 

we are exposed to risks relating to the solvency of other insurers 

we are subject to assessments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies including longterm care insurers hmos aca coops and other payors to policyholders and claimants for example in the first quarter of 2017 aetna recorded a discounted estimated liability expense of 231 million pretax for our estimated share of future assessments for longterm care insurer penn treaty network america insurance company and one of its subsidiaries guaranty funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer hmo aca coop andor other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its financial obligations these funds are usually financed by assessments against insurers regulated by a state future assessments may have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 

extreme events or the threat of extreme events could materially increase our health care including behavioral health costs 

nuclear biological or other attacks whether as a result of war or terrorism other manmade disasters natural disasters epidemics pandemics and other extreme events can affect the us economy in general our industries and us specifically in particular such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could result in significant health care including behavioral health costs which also would be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and other insurers such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events also could disrupt our supply chains andor our distribution chains for the products we sell in addition our employees and those of our vendors are concentrated in certain large metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed to these events such events could adversely affect our businesses operating results and cash flows and in the event of extreme circumstances our financial condition or viability particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors 

risks from changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to potential changes in public policy laws and regulations including reform of the us health care system which can adversely affect our businesses entitlement program reform if it occurs could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operations andor operating results 

the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operations and operating results could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation andor increased regulation of pbms including changes to the medicare or medicaid programs including the block grant option outlined by cms on january 30 2020 or the regulatory environment for health care and related benefits including the aca changes to laws or regulations governing drug reimbursement andor pricing changes to the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changes to laws andor regulations governing drug manufacturers’ rebates changes to laws andor regulations governing reimbursements paid to pharmacists by andor reporting required by pbms changes to immigration policies andor other public policy initiatives it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of us presidential executive orders other significant changes to health care and related benefits system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries also are possible and could adversely affect our businesses if we fail to respond adequately to such changes including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives or do not respond as effectively as our competitors our businesses operations and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

in addition to efforts to amend repeal or replace the aca and related regulations we expect the federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and our businesses potential modification to the aca including changes in enforcement andor funding that further destabilize the public exchanges as well as significant changes to medicaid funding including the block grant option outlined by cms on january 30 2020 could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further changes to federal health care and related benefits laws including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing laws laws governing pbms andor laws governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs are probable we cannot predict the effect if any that new health care and related benefits legislation future changes to the aca or the implementation of or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca may have on our pharmacy services retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy andor health care benefits operations andor operating results the federal and many state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation enforcement andor application of existing programs laws and regulations including changes to payments under and funding of medicare and medicaid programs and increased regulation of pbms 

further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of pbms including formulary management or other pbm services drug pricing or purchasing patent term extensions andor purchase discount andor rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers also could reduce the discounts or rebates we receive changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees also could adversely affect our profitability 

we cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operations or operating results which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matters it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we compete examples of such changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing andor importation changing the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 

for more information on these matters see “government regulation” included in item 1 of this form 10k 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations many of which are highly complex we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions or suffer brand and reputational harm 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state federal and international governmental authorities the laws and regulations governing our operations and interpretations of those laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflict with one another in general these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers members and providers rather than us or our investors in addition the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year we also must follow various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries put in place by certain state regulators 

certain of our pharmacy services and retailltc operations products and services are subject to 

 

our health care benefits products are highly regulated particularly those that serve medicare medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs and small group commercial customers and members the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for noncompliance 

the scope of the practices and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit and we are a defendant in a number of such proceedings if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act the “false claims act” we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs including medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs and we also may be required to pay significant fines andor other monetary penalties whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies the significant incentives and protections provided to whistleblowers under applicable law increase the risk of whistleblower suits 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations that apply to government programs we could be subject to criminal fines civil penalties premium refunds prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs plan and other programs and on our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses profitability and growth also may be adversely affected by i judicial and regulatory decisions that change andor expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations impose medical or bad faith liability increase our responsibilities under erisa or the remedies available under erisa or reduce the scope of erisa preemption of state law claims including rutledge v pharm care mgmt assoc  which is currently pending before the us supreme court or ii other legislation and regulations 

if our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatory actions andor litigation 

in addition to being subject to extensive and complex regulations many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements in order to be eligible to offer certain products or bid on certain contracts we must demonstrate that we have robust systems and processes in place that are designed to maintain compliance with all applicable legal regulatory and contractual requirements these systems and processes frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers and regulators if our systems and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements and to prevent and detect instances of or the potential for noncompliance fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions litigation and other proceedings which may result in damages fines suspension or loss of licensure suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs andor other penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we routinely are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings including class actions and qui tam actions many of these proceedings seek substantial damages which may not be covered by insurance these proceedings are costly to defend may result in changes in our business practices harm our brand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and operating results 

pbm retail pharmacy mail order pharmacy specialty pharmacy ltc pharmacy and health care and related benefits are highly regulated industries whose participants frequently are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings we are currently subject to various litigation and arbitration matters investigations regulatory audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and other legal proceedings both inside and outside the us outside the us contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the us litigation related to our provision of professional services in our medical clinics pharmacies and ltc operations is increasing as we expand our services along the continuum of health care 

litigation and particularly securities derivative collective or class action and qui tam litigation is often expensive and disruptive many of the legal proceedings against us seek substantial damages including noneconomic or punitive damages and treble damages and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in our business practices while we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage andor the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability also may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the outcome of litigation and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law or regulation can and do occur and the costs incurred frequently are substantial regardless of the outcome litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses operating results andor cash flows because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings see item 3 of this form 10k for additional information 

we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in material refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities and other sanctions 

as one of the largest national retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacy pbm and health care and related benefits providers we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental market conduct and other audits investigations and reviews by and we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from various federal and state agencies regulatory authorities attorneys general committees subcommittees and members of the us congress and other state federal and international governmental authorities for example we have received civil investigative demands “cids” from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program cms and the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services the “oig” also are auditing the risk adjustmentrelated data of certain of our medicare advantage plans and the number of such audits continues to increase several such audits investigations and reviews by governmental authorities currently are pending some of which may be resolved in 2020 the results of which may be adverse to us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical andor other covered services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources in addition our medical costs and the medical expenses of our health care benefits asc customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by providers andor members 

regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews by federal state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in significant or material premium refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure any of these audits investigations or reviews could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us 

see “legal and regulatory proceedings” in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information 

our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as we offer new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical core businesses of pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits 

historically we focused primarily on providing pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits products and services as a result of our transformation program and other innovation initiatives we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new products and services such as the home hemodialysis device we are developing which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically have offered 

the increased volume of business in areas beyond our historical core businesses and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that are different from the risks of providing pharmacy services retailltc and health care benefits products and services and increase significantly our exposure to other risks 

we face unique regulatory and other challenges in our medicare and medicaid businesses 

we are seeking to substantially grow the medicare and medicaid membership in our health care benefits segment in 2020 and over the next several years we face unique regulatory and other challenges that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those businesses 





correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid operating results and cash flows andor our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect that percentage to increase as our government funded businesses grow our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases 

our revenues from government funded programs including in health care benefits’ medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses and from government customers in its commercial business are dependent on annual funding by the federal government andor applicable state or local governments federal state and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities 

the us federal government and our other government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs cancel or decline to renew contracts with us or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs the services provided to enrollees in such programs our premiums and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows when federal funding is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive and we remain liable for and are required to fund claims from providers for providing services to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate an extended federal government shutdown or a delay by congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling also could lead to a delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could in turn have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses operating results cash flows and liquidity 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm and retailltc businesses 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price “awp” or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts drug purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs “ffs medicaid” have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practices in health care benefits’ commercial and other government products 

future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from our pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with drug manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections we cannot predict the effect of these possible changes on our businesses 

we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increases in our insured health care benefits products which would have an adverse effect on our revenues mbrs and operating results and could magnify the adverse impact of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of aca assessments fees and taxes 

premium rates for our insured health care benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval which creates risk for us in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires a review by hhs in conjunction with state regulators of premium rate increases that exceed a federally specified threshold or lower statespecific thresholds set by states determined by hhs to have adequate processes rate reviews can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins medical benefit ratios “mbrs” and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit costs increased utilization of covered services and aca assessments fees and taxes by restricting our ability to reflect these increases andor these assessments fees and taxes in our pricing further our ability to reflect aca assessments fees and taxes in our medicare medicaid and chip premium rates is limited 

since 2013 hhs has issued determinations to health plans that their premium rate increases were “unreasonable” and we continue to experience challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in certain states regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rate increases either by enforcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards regulators or legislatures in several states also have conducted hearings on proposed premium rate increases which can result and in some instances have resulted in substantial delays in implementing proposed rate increases even if they ultimately are approved our plans can be excluded from participating in small group public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could adversely affect our mbrs and lead to operating margin compression 

we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our insured health care benefits products we may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies if we are unable to obtain adequate premium rates andor premium rate increases it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and mbrs and our ability to earn adequate returns on insured health care benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies andor products 

minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefits products while leaving us exposed to higher than expected medical costs challenges to our minimum mlr rebate methodology andor reports could adversely affect our operating results 

the aca’s minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in health care benefits’ commercial insured and medicare insured businesses cms minimum mlr rebate regulations limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portions of our health care benefits medicaid and federal employees health benefits “fehb” program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebates payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirements are detailed federal and state auditors are challenging our commercial health care benefits business’ compliance with the aca’s minimum mlr requirements as well as our fehb plans’ compliance with opm’s fehb programspecific minimum mlr requirements our medicare and medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum mlr audits if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms additional challenges to our methodology andor reports relating to minimum mlr and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible the outcome of these audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity 

the federal and certain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business including increased minimum wages and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave in addition our employeerelated operating costs may be increased by union organizing activity if we are unable to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases our operating results will be adversely affected 

we face international political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domestic operations 

we significantly expanded our international operations as a result of the aetna acquisition as a result of our expanded international operations we face political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations these risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints our international products need to meet countryspecific customer and member preferences as well as countryspecific legal requirements including those related to licensing data privacy data storage and data protection 

our international operations increase our exposure to and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of nonus jurisdictions such as the european union’s “eu’s” general data protection regulation “gdpr” and the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws of the united states including the fcpa and the united kingdom including the uk bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions implementing our compliance policies internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resources over several years before any significant revenues or profits are generated violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we must regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our businesses and operations our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results andor financial condition 

our international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages cultures legal and regulatory schemes and time zones our international operations encounter labor laws standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate in some countries we are required to or choose to operate with local business associates which requires us to manage our relationships with these third parties and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges 

in some countries we may be exposed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting local currencies into us dollars or other currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues operating results and cash flows from our international operations some of our operations are and are increasingly likely to be in emerging markets where these risks are heightened any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective 

risks associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

risks relating to our acquisition of aetna 

we expect to continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of cvs health and aetna we may not achieve the net benefit that we project of such expenditures associated with the elimination of duplicative costs the realization of other efficiencies that we project related to the integration of our businesses or the realization of the growth opportunities that we project from the aetna acquisition in the near term or at all in addition the postclosing integration of the operations of cvs health and aetna and related matters may require substantial commitments of management and other resources and management time which could otherwise have been devoted to our ongoing businesses and operations andor to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us 

parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the aetna acquisition andor the postclosing integration process including with respect to current or future business relationships with the combined business our business relationships including business relationships of our health care benefits segment may be subject to disruption as customers members manufacturers providers vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the combined business 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies we acquire 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company also may be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies andor growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and operating results furthermore acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or service areas and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities which may be unsuccessful cause us to assume unanticipated liabilities disrupt our existing businesses be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy in addition to the integration risks noted above some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include 



 

in addition joint ventures present risks that are different from acquisitions including selection of appropriate joint venture parties initial and ongoing governance of the joint venture joint venture compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the joint venture’s business in a manner acceptable to all the parties including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures maintaining positive relationships among the joint venture parties and the joint venture’s customers and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination 

risks related to our operations 

failure to meet customer expectations may harm our brand and reputation our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership and our operating results and cash flows 

our ability to attract and retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective quality customer service operations such as call center operations pbm functions retail pharmacy and ltc services retail mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claims processing customer case installation and online access and tools that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations either directly or through vendors as we seek to reduce general and administrative expenses we must balance the potential impact of costsaving measures on our customer and other service and performance if we misjudge the effects of such measures customer and other service may be adversely affected we depend on third parties for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operations if we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations we may have difficulty retaining or profitably growing our customer base andor membership which could adversely affect our operating results for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our thirdparty vendors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results brand and reputation 

we and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience cyber attacks we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future 

we and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience a variety of cyber attacks and we and our vendors expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward among other things we and our vendors have experienced automated attempts to gain access to public facing networks brute force syn flood and distributed denial of service attacks attempted malware infections vulnerability scanning ransomware attacks spearphishing campaigns mass reconnaissance attempts injection attempts phishing php injection and crosssite scripting we also have seen an increase in attacks designed to obtain access to consumers’ accounts using illegally obtained demographic information although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or operating results through december 31 2019 we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future as we expand our consumeroriented products and services increase the amount and types of data we acquire generate and use increase the amount of information we make available to members consumers and providers on mobile devices expand our use of vendors expand internationally and expand our use of social media our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risks including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access to andor disruption of our systems and the customer member provider employee accountable care organization “aco” joint venture vendor and other third party information they contain increases and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases 

although we deploy a layered approach to address information security including cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that is designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could 

distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to a cyberincident are significant large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information following a cyberincident our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberincident could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and members in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers our members or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ private information and our customers members and other constituents to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation businesses and prospects our use and disclosure of members’ customers’ and other constituents’ sensitive information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels we would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or other vendors fail to adequately protect members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information 

our information systems are critical to the operation of our businesses we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of personal health and financial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers members and other constituents in the ordinary course of our businesses some of our information systems rely upon third party systems to accomplish these tasks the use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal state and international levels and these laws rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity such as the california consumer privacy act which went into effect january 1 2020 the eu’s gdpr which began to apply across the eu during 2018 and the audit program implemented by hhs under hipaa in some cases such laws rules and regulations also apply to our vendors andor may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than us laws and regulations and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach cyberattack or cybersecurity breach and any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential customer member or other constituent information whether by us by one of our business associates or vendors or by another third party could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage could interrupt our operations and could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition 

our businesses depend on our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and operating results and also could expose andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows or financial condition large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information there can be no assurance that additional such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of drugs and consuming drugs in a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide for example we are a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings relating to opioids and the sale of products containing talc our businesses involve the provision of professional services including by pharmacists physician assistants nurses and nurse practitioners which exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage available under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us from third parties may not be adequate to protect us against the financial impact of the related claims we also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor financial condition 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses operating results andor future performance 

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation andor benefits costs if we are unable to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance 

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results andor future performance the succession plans we have in place and our employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent thirdparty brokers consultants and agents new distribution channels create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result of the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling our products 

our products are sold primarily through our sales personnel who frequently work with independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent brokers consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend andor market health care benefits products of our competitors accordingly we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sales personnel and thirdparty brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels this risk is heightened as we develop operate and expand our consumeroriented products and services and we expand in the health care space and our business model evolves to include a greater focus on consumers and directtoconsumer sales such as competing for sales on insurance exchanges 

new distribution channels for our products and services continue to emerge including private exchanges operated by health care consultants and technology companies these channels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their health care benefits in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplace entrants that could interfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas 

in addition there have been several investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive these investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practices which could adversely affect our ability to market our products 

failure of our businesses to effectively collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results 

to maximize our overall enterprise value our various businesses need to collaborate effectively our businesses need to be aligned in order to prioritize goals and coordinate the design of new products intended to utilize the offerings of multiple businesses including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs in addition misaligned incentives information siloes ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures for example significant financial decisions being made at an inappropriate level in our organization also could prevent us from maximizing our operating results andor achieving our financial and other projections 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses could adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and cash flows 

our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches cyberattacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in us and foreign laws and regulations including privacy and information security laws and standards may cause us to incur significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

our business success and operating results depend in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing customer loyalty and subscription programs finance and other processes throughout our operations we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of confidential and sensitive data and information including personally identifiable information and protected health information that our customers members and other constituents provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 

we have many different information and other technology systems supporting our businesses including as a result of our acquisitions our businesses depend in large part on these systems to adequately price our products and services accurately establish reserves process claims and report operating results and interact with providers employer plan sponsors customers members consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices certain of our technology systems including software are older legacy systems that are less flexible less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resources to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems we must reengineer and reduce the number of these systems to meet changing consumer and vendor preferences and needs improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses we also need to develop or acquire new technology systems contract with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumeroriented and transformation products and services we are developing operating and expanding andor to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standards including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats if we fail to achieve these objectives our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

in addition information technology and other technology and process improvement projects including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced systems we could among other things have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimates andor establishing appropriate pricing meeting the needs of customers consumers providers members and vendors developing and expanding our consumeroriented products and services or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these vendors are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems we use if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our operating results 

both our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating results 

we and our vendors are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks including natural disasters utility and other mechanical failures acts of war or terrorism disruption of communications data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulties the occurrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect our operations we also may be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such events although we have developed procedures for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and as a result our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our businesses in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans may not be effective should any such hazards or risks occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

we would be adversely affected if we do not effectively deploy our capital  downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could adversely affect our brand and reputation businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

our operations generate significant capital and we have the ability to raise additional capital the manner in which we deploy our capital including investments in our businesses our operations such as information technology and other strategic and capital projects dividends acquisitions share andor debt repurchases repayment of debt reinsurance or other capital uses impacts our financial strength claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized statistical rating organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughout our industries our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds we believe our credit ratings and the financial strength and claims paying ability of our principal insurance and hmo subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our health care benefits products to certain of our customers 

each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future in connection with the completion of the aetna acquisition each of standard  poor’s moody’s and fitch downgraded certain of our debt financial strength andor other credit ratings downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows and financial condition 

goodwill and other intangible assets could in the future become impaired 

as of december 31 2019  we had 1129 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2018 we took 61 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our ltc reporting unit within the retailltc segment 

goodwill and indefinitelylived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate industrywide changes changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

adverse conditions in the us and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities mortgage loans alternative investments and other investments and our operating results andor our financial condition 

the global capital markets including credit markets continue to experience volatility and uncertainty as an insurer we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the us as a result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the us and to a lesser extent the international financial markets and volatility uncertainty andor disruptions in the global capital markets particularly the us credit markets and governments’ monetary policy particularly us monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our operating results andor our financial condition by 

 

although we seek within guidelines we deem appropriate to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures a failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstances our cash flows 

we have incurred and assumed significant indebtedness which has increased our consolidated interest expense and could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

in order to complete the aetna acquisition we incurred acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 450 billion and assumed aetna’s existing indebtedness with a fair value of approximately 81 billion our substantial indebtedness and elevated debttoequity ratio have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense compared to preaetna acquisition periods in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the aetna acquisition we have suspended share repurchases until we reach our desired debttoequity ratio the increased levels of indebtedness also could reduce funds available to engage in investments in product development capital expenditures dividend payments and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

risks related to our relationships with manufacturers providers suppliers and vendors 

we face risks relating to the market availability pricing suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell 

our retailltc segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs our pbm business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members as a result we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers we acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers certain of our agreements with such suppliers are shortterm and cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could adversely affect our prescription drug supply and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and financial condition moreover many products distributed by our pharmacies are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in some cases we depend upon a single source of supply any such supply shortages or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our businesses operating results and cash flows in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade regulations could adversely affect our businesses 

our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control if our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery including as a result of supply shortages supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with providers on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networks with high quality providers 

we are seeking to enhance our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risksharing arrangements with health care providers providers’ willingness to enter these arrangements with us depends upon among other things our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these valuebased contracts these arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our members these arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies target new customer groups increase membership and reduce medical costs and if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative sources if such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customers may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership and our ability to profitably grow our business andor our operating results may be adversely affected 

while we believe joint ventures acos and other nontraditional health care provider organizational structures present opportunities for us the implementation of our joint ventures and other nontraditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows among other things joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rates that make the joint ventures economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint ventures we may not be able to achieve these objectives in one or more of our joint ventures which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

if our service providers fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation andor regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs 

we contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems our arrangements with these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations for example certain of our vendors have been responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members and employees which has caused us to incur additional expenses and given rise to regulatory actions and litigation against us 

these risks are particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs where third parties perform pbm medical management and other member related services for us any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policies data security andor cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceedings prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions fines sanctions andor penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition 

we may experience increased medical and other benefit costs litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not have contracts with us render services to our health care benefits members 

some providers that render services to our health care benefits members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with these providers as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example in october 2018 an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately 150 million in a proceeding relating to aetna’s outofnetwork benefit payment and administration practices and in march 2019 that award was reduced to approximately 86 million such disputes may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs make it difficult for us to compete in certain geographies and create new competitors 

hospitals and other providers and health systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and has the potential to improve the delivery of health care services it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies these health systems also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us a process that has been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaidonly acos developed as a result of state medicaid laws practice management companies consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other health care providers adopt continues to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate these changes may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs and may require us to change our operations including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses or are unable to collaborate or contract with providers on acceptable terms each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and operating results

the national association of insurance commissioners the “naic” utilizes riskbased capital “rbc” standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weaklycapitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus the “rbc ratio” the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies within certain ratio ranges regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases there are four levels of regulatory action ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control at december 31 2019  the rbc ratio of each of the company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action the rbc framework described above for insurers has been extended by the naic to health organizations including hmos although not all states had adopted these rules at december 31 2019  at that date each of the company’s active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or where adopted the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic’s rbc rules external rating agencies use their own capital models andor rbc standards when they determine a company’s rating 

critical accounting policies 

the company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment estimates and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis the company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements while the company believes the historical experience current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles actual results could differ from estimates and such differences could be material 

significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment andor complexity and thus are considered to be critical accounting policies the company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board the “audit committee” and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them 

revenue recognition 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the company’s retail pharmacy network the company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time pbm services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs 

the company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members the company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related pbm services 

revenues include i the portion of the price the client pays directly to the company net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client see “drug discounts” and “guarantees” below ii the price paid to the company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions “retail copayments” and iii claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts sales taxes are not included in revenues 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs the company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the pharmacy services segment 

 

for contracts under which the company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member revenue is recognized using the net method 

drug discounts 

the company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brandname formulary drugs the company estimates these rebates at periodend based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients the estimates are based on the best available data at periodend 

and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client the company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

guarantees 

the company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

retailltc segment 

retail pharmacy 

the company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise for pharmacy sales each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined valuebased service and performance metrics the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition 

revenue from company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers ie breakage are recognized based on historical redemption patterns 

customer returns are not material to the company’s operating results or financial condition sales taxes are not included in revenues 

loyalty and other programs 

the company’s customer loyalty program extracare ®  consists of two components extrasavings tm and extrabucks ® rewards extrasavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level 

extrabucks rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels thus the company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction the company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the extrabucks rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards revenue allocated to extrabucks rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed at the end of each period unredeemed extrabucks rewards are reflected as a contract liability 

the company also offers a subscriptionbased membership program carepass ®  under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the company delivering the goods and services revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied 

longterm care 

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the company separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements a significant portion of longterm care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal medicare part d program and to a lesser extent state medicaid programs the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources as well as longterm care facilities and other third party insurance payors and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated 

differences between billed and reimbursed amounts accordingly the total revenues and receivables reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors 

patient copayments associated with medicare part d certain state medicaid programs medicare part b and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures 

walkin medical clinics 

for services provided by the company’s walkin medical clinics revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates 

health care benefits segment 

health care benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers revenue is recognized based on customer billings which reflect contracted rates per employee and the number of covered employees recorded in the company’s records at the time the billings are prepared billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month 

the company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors these adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments in each period the company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly as information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known the company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise a significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the company’s operating results 

premium revenue 

premiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts additionally premium revenue subject to the aca’s minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” rebate requirements is recorded net of the estimated minimum mlr rebates for the current calendar year premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods unearned premiums are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned 

some of the company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of insured members such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract 

services revenue 

services revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations the health care benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of the following components 

 

accounting for medicare part d 

revenues include insurance premiums earned by the company’s pdps which are determined based on the pdp’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms the insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium which is the responsibility of the pdp member and can be subsidized by cms in the case of lowincome members and a direct premium paid by cms premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 

revenues also include a risksharing feature of the medicare part d program design referred to as the risk corridor the company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to or receivable from cms under the risk corridor and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to cms at the end of the reporting year 

in addition to medicare part d premiums the company receives additional payments each month from cms related to catastrophic reinsurance lowincome cost sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits if the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable net or accrued expenses 

otherthantemporary impairments of debt securities 

the company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value is otherthantemporary if a decline in the fair value of a debt security is considered otherthantemporary the cost basis or carrying value of the debt security is written down the writedown is then bifurcated into its credit and noncredit related components the amount of the creditrelated component is included in the company’s net income loss and the amount of the noncredit related component is included in other comprehensive income loss unless the company intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis the company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

among the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment’s current and shortterm prospects for recovery for unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions for example increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market or industryrelated events the company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis if either case is true the company recognizes an otherthantemporary impairment and the cost basiscarrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value 

the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that the facts and circumstances factored into the company’s assessment may change with the passage of time unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods 

vendor allowances and purchase discounts 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased contractual arrangements with vendors including manufacturers wholesalers and retail pharmacies normally provide for the pharmacy services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one or a combination of the following forms i a direct discount at the time of purchase ii a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or iii when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy a discount or rebate paid subsequent to dispensing these rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter historically the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the company’s operating results or financial condition the company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed the pharmacy services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes in addition the pharmacy services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 

retailltc segment 

vendor allowances received by the retailltc segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs andor other services provided amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense included in operating expenses when the related advertising commitment is 

satisfied any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straightline basis over the life of the related contract 

there have not been any material changes in the way the company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years 

inventory 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method 

the value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and ltc pharmacy and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated the company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts when estimating these losses a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a locationbylocation basis and current physical inventory loss trends 

the total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was 401 million as of december 31 2019  although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses it is possible that actual results could differ in order to help investors assess the aggregate risk if any associated with the inventoryrelated uncertainties discussed above a ten percent 10 pretax change in estimated inventory losses which is a reasonably likely change would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately 40 million as of december 31 2019  

although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 

rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments as the interest rate implicit in the company’s leases is not readily determinable the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate determined by class of underlying asset to discount the lease payments the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives 

the company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each for real estate leases the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy generally the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the rightofuse asset and lease liability similarly renewal options are not included in the lease term for nonreal estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets and lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the shortterm lease 

for real estate leases the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities 

longlived asset impairment 

recoverability of definitelived assets 

the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets excluding goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the company groups and evaluates these longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified if indicators of impairment are present the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges if required an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 

the longlived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales profitability and cash flows when preparing these estimates the company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales profitability and cash flow results and forecasts these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs andor increased member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns 

during the year ended december 31 2019  the company recorded store rationalization charges of 231 million  primarily related to operating lease rightofuse asset impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2018 the company recognized a 43 million longlived asset impairment charge primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment there were no material impairment charges recognized on longlived assets in the year ended december 31 2017 

recoverability of goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value or carrying amount including goodwill the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the net book value carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates these assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes discount rates terminal growth rates and forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization income taxes capital expenditures and future working capital requirements when determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates the company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends consolidated revenues profitability and cash flow results and forecasts and industry trends the company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions the riskfree interest rate environment the company’s market capitalization efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs including their prescription drug costs andor increase member copayments the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns 

2019 goodwill impairment test 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4 and 9 respectively 

as of the aetna acquisition date the company added the health care benefits segment which included the commercial business reporting unit the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition as a result at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit was equal to its carrying value given the close proximity of the aetna acquisition date to the 2019 annual impairment test of goodwill as expected the fair 

value of the commercial business reporting unit remained relatively in line with the carrying value of the reporting unit in addition this fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in the revenue growth rate operating income and the discount rate 

although the company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the ltc reporting unit in the third quarter of 2019 were reasonable and achievable the ltc reporting unit may continue to face challenges that may affect the company’s ability to grow the ltc reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed these challenges and some of the key assumptions included in the company’s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of the ltc reporting unit include client retention rates occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities the financial health of skilled nursing facility customers facility reimbursement pressures the company’s ability to execute its senior living initiative the company’s ability to make acquisitions and integrate those businesses into its ltc operations in an orderly manner and the company’s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives the fair value of the ltc reporting unit also is dependent on market multiples of peer group companies and the riskfree interest rate environment which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow valuation method if the company does not achieve its forecasts it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the ltc reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount as of december 31 2019 the remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit was 431 million 

2018 goodwill impairment tests 

as discussed in note 5 ‘‘goodwill and other intangibles’’ included in item 8 of this 10k during 2018 the ltc reporting unit continued to experience industrywide challenges that impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the company acquired omnicare and when the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed those challenges included lower client retention rates lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018 and continued facility reimbursement pressures in june 2018 ltc management submitted its initial budget for 2019 and updated the 2018 annual forecast which showed a deterioration in the projected financial results for the remainder of 2018 and in 2019 which also caused management to update its longterm forecast beyond 2019 based on these updated projections management determined that there were indicators that the ltc reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of june 30 2018 the results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in a 39 billion pretax goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2018 

during the third quarter of 2018 the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill the goodwill impairment tests showed that the fair values of the pharmacy services and retail pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair value of the ltc reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 2 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the ltc reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues including one significant customer bankruptcy additionally ltc management submitted an updated final budget for 2019 which showed significant additional deterioration in the projected financial results for 2019 compared to the analyses performed in the second and third quarters of 2018 primarily due to continued industry and operational challenges which also caused management to make further updates to its longterm forecast beyond 2019 based on these updated projections management determined that there were indicators that the ltc reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018 the results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in an additional 22 billion pretax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 

in 2018 the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method in addition to the lower financial projections changes in riskfree interest rates and lower market multiples of peer group companies also contributed to the amount of the 2018 goodwill impairment charges 

2017 goodwill impairment tests 

the company recorded 181 million in goodwill impairment charges in 2017 related to the rxcrossroads reporting unit during the third quarter of 2017 the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill the goodwill impairment test showed that the fair values of the pharmacy services and retail pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair values of the ltc and rxcrossroads reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 1 and 6 respectively on january 2 2018 the company sold its rxcrossroads reporting unit to mckesson corporation for 725 million  

recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset the company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions availability of market information and the profitability of the company there were no impairment losses recognized on indefinitelived intangible assets in any of the years ended december 31 2019  2018 or 2017  

health care costs payable 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  73 and 67 respectively of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of i services rendered to the company’s insured members but not yet reported to the company and ii claims which have been reported to the company but not yet paid collectively “ibnr” health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements the remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments the company develops its estimate of ibnr using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’ included in item 8 of this 10k for additional information on the company’s reserving methodology 

during 2019 the company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end after considering the claims paid in 2019 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 27 basis points higher than previously estimated resulting in a decrease of 240 million in 2019 in health care costs payable that related to the prior year the company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of ibnr as of december 31 2019  however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 19 basis points from the company’s assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus 227 million pretax 

also during 2019 the company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated specifically after considering the claims paid in 2019 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed health care costs that were approximately 32 lower than previously estimated during the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a reduction of 284 million in 2019 in health care costs payable that related to prior year 

management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates when establishing reserves as of december 31 2019  the company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 34 from health care cost trend rates recently observed however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 35 from the assumed rates which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus 349 million pretax 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted regardless of when they are effective deferred tax assets are reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain additionally the company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax 

authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority interest andor penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions the company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals as warranted due to changing facts and circumstances

the company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk credit quality risk market valuation risk foreign currency risk commodity risk and operational risk 

evaluation of interest rate and credit quality risk 

the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate the company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio in connection with its investment and risk management objectives the company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by among other things levels of or changes in interest rates shortterm or longterm duration prepayment rates equity markets or credit ratingsspreads the company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps treasury rate locks forward contracts futures contracts warrants put options and credit default swaps these instruments viewed separately subject the company to varying degrees of interest rate equity price and credit risk however when used for hedging the company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk 

investments 

the company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at december 31 2019 and 2018

the company markets both commercial insured and asc products and services primarily to employers that sponsor the company’s products for the benefit of their employees and their employees’ dependents frequently larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period typically employers pay all of the monthly premiums to the company and through payroll deductions obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer some health care benefits products are sold directly to employees of employer groups on a fully employeefunded basis in some cases the company bills the covered individual directly 

the company offers insured medicare coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees medicaid and chip members are enrolled on an individual basis the company also offers insured health care coverage to members who are duallyeligible for both medicare and medicaid

health care benefits pricing 

for commercial insured plans contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year fees under asc plans are generally fixed for a period of one year 

generally a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for commercial insured plans the company typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period however it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer among other factors in determining premium rates for future policy periods where required by state laws premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contract inception future results of operations could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators 

the company has medicare advantage and pdp contracts with cms to provide hmo ppo and prescription drug coverage to medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas under these annual contracts cms pays the company a fixed capitation payment andor a portion of the premium both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors cms also considers inflation changes in utilization patterns and average per capita feeforservice medicare costs in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium pdp contracts also provide a risksharing arrangement with cms to limit the company’s exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses amounts payable to the company under the medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by cms and the company elects to participate in each medicare service area or region on an annual basis premiums paid to the company for medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits which can result and have resulted in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government andor members in addition to payments received from cms some of medicare advantage products and all pdp products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer in some cases these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member’s income and asset levels compared to commercial medical products medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and health care and other benefit costs 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “aca” ties a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings” since 2015 plans must have a star rating of four or higher out of five to qualify for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates cms released 2019 

page 10 

star ratings in october 2018 the 2019 star ratings will be used to determine which medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2020 based on membership at december 31 2018  79 of the company’s medicare advantage members were in plans with 2019 star ratings of at least 40 stars 

rates for medicare supplement products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan 

under insured medicaid contracts state government agencies pay the company fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state line of business and demographics and the company arranges pays for and manages the health care services provided to medicaid beneficiaries these rates are subject to change by each state and in some instances provide for adjustment for health risk factors cms requires these rates to be actuarially sound the company also receives fees from customers where it provides services under asc medicaid contracts asc medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year and certain of them contain performance incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical financial and operational metrics under these arrangements performance is evaluated annually with associated financial incentive opportunities and financial risk share obligations are typically limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the company payments to the company under medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process in the applicable state 

under duals contracts the rate setting process is generally established by cms in partnership with the state government agency participating in the demonstration project both cms and the state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances including if the company fails to comply with cms regulations or other contractual requirements 

the company offers hmo and consumerdirected medical and dental plans to federal employees under the federal employees health benefits “fehb” program and the federal employees dental and vision insurance program premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit which can result and have resulted in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government andor members 

beginning in 2014 the aca imposed significant new industrywide fees assessments and taxes including an annual levy called the health insurer fee the “hif” in december 2015 the consolidated appropriation act was enacted which included a one year suspension of the hif for 2017 in january 2018 the hif was suspended for 2019 for additional information on the aca fees assessments and taxes see note 1 ‘‘significant accounting policies’’  contained in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the annual report which is incorporated by reference herein the company’s goal is to collect in premiums and fees where possible or solve for all of these acarelated fees assessments and taxes 

health care benefits seasonality 

the majority of health care benefits segment revenues are not seasonal in nature however the health care benefits segment’s quarterly operating income progression is impacted by i the seasonality of benefit costs which generally increase during the year as insured members progress through their annual deductibles and outofpocket expense limits and ii the seasonality of operating expenses which are generally the highest during the fourth quarter due to increased marketing spending associated with medicare annual enrollment as a result the health care benefits segment’s operating income generally is the highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the fourth quarter of the year 

health care benefits competition 

the health care benefits industry is highly competitive primarily due to a large number of forprofit and notforprofit competitors competitors’ marketing and pricing and a proliferation of competing products including new products that are continually being introduced into the marketplace new entrants into the marketplace as well as consolidation within the industry have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment in addition the rapid pace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumerfocused retail marketplace including public and private exchanges and the increased use of technology to interact with members providers and customers increase the risks currently faced from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors compared to prior periods references to competitors and other companies throughout this annual report on form 10k including the information incorporated by reference herein are for illustrative or comparison purposes only and do not indicate that these companies are the company’s or any segment’s only competitors or closest competitors

page 11 

provider networks ability to offer different provider network options providers available in such networks and quality of member support and care management programs the company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors the company’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase health care benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability to differentiate itself from its competitors on these factors competition may also affect the availability of services from health care providers including primary care physicians specialists and hospitals 

insured products compete with local and regional health care benefits plans health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health care benefit insurance companies health system owned health plans new entrants into the marketplace and numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross and blue shield association the largest competitor in medicare products is original medicare additional health care benefits segment competitors include other types of medical and dental provider organizations various specialty service providers including pbm services providers health care consultants financial services companies integrated health care delivery organizations networks of providers who also coordinate administrative services for and assume insurance risk of their members third party administrators “tpas” hit companies and for certain plans programs sponsored by the federal or state governments emerging competitors include start up health care benefits plans technology companies providerowned health plans new joint ventures including notforprofit joint ventures among firms from multiple industries technology firms financial services firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary private exchanges and consulting firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary private exchanges as well as nontraditional distributors such as retail companies the company’s ability to increase the number of persons enrolled in insured commercial medical products also is affected by the desire and ability of employers to selffund their health coverage 

the health care benefits segment’s asc plans compete primarily with other large commercial health care benefit companies numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross and blue shield association and tpas 

the health care benefits segment’s international products compete with local global and united states based health plans and commercial health care benefit insurance companies many of whom have a longer operating history and better brand recognition and greater marketplace presence in one or more geographies 

the provider solutions and hit marketplaces and products are evolving rapidly the company competes for provider solutions and hit business with other large health plans and commercial health care benefit insurance companies as well as information technology companies and companies that specialize in provider solutions and hit many information technology product competitors have longer operating histories better brand recognition greater marketplace presence and more experience in developing innovative products 

in addition to competitive pressures affecting the company’s ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers the health care benefits segment’s medical membership has been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse andor uncertain economic conditions and reductions in workforce by existing customers due to adverse andor uncertain general economic conditions especially in the united states and industries where such membership is concentrated 

health care benefits reinsurance

government regulation 

overview 

the company’s operations are subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which it does business there also continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by federal state and international regulators of the health and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices in addition many of the company’s pbm clients and the company’s payors in the retailltc segment including insurers medicare part d plans managed medicaid plans and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor similarly the company’s ltc clients such as skilled nursing facilities are subject to government regulations including many of the same government regulations to which the company is subject 

the laws and rules governing the company’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the company’s businesses creates areas of uncertainty further there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal state and international levels some of which could adversely affect the company’s businesses if they are enacted the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or 

page 13 

court proceedings including future united states congressional appropriations will change various aspects of the industries in which it operates or the health care industry generally or the impact those changes will have on the company’s businesses results of operations andor cash flows but the effects could be materially adverse any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations as summarized below or any adverse applications or interpretations of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting the company andor its businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition andor cash flows see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

the company cannot give any assurances that its businesses financial condition results of operations andor cash flows will not be materially adversely affected or that it will not be required to materially change its business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to one or more of the company’s businesses one or more of the industries in which it operates andor the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of one or more of the company’s businesses one or more of the industries in which it operates andor the health care industry generally iv pending or future government audits investigations or enforcement actions against the company v adverse developments in any pending qui tam  lawsuit against the company whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam  lawsuit that may be filed against the company or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against the company or affecting one or more of the industries in which it operates andor the health care industry generally 

laws and regulations related to multiple segments of the company’s business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs   the company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims for reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute state false claims acts and antikickback statutes in most states the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the false claims act prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs in addition any claim for government reimbursement also violates the false claims act where it results from a violation of the federal antikickback statute 

both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government participants in the health and related benefits industry including the company frequently are subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

the aca   the aca made broadbased changes to the united states health care system if the aca is not further amended repealed or replaced certain of its components will continue to be phased in until 2022 while the company anticipates continued efforts in 2019 and beyond to invalidate modify repeal or replace the aca the company expects aspects of the aca to continue to significantly impact its business operations and results of operations including pricing medical benefit ratios “mbrs” and the geographies in which the company’s products are available 

while most of the significant aspects of the aca became effective during or prior to 2014 parts of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive orders regulations and guidance as well as ongoing litigation additional changes to the aca and those regulations and guidance at the federal andor state level are likely and those changes are likely to be significant growing federal and state budgetary pressures make it more likely that any changes including changes at the state level in response to changes to or invalidation repeal or replacement of the aca andor changes in the funding levels andor payment mechanisms of federally supported benefit programs will be adverse to us for example if any elements of the aca are invalidated or repealed at the federal level the company expects that some states would seek to enact similar requirements such as prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage requiring coverage for dependents up to age 26 requiring guaranteed renewability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limits on insurance coverage 

page 14 

the expansion of health care coverage contemplated by the aca is being funded in part by reductions to the reimbursements the company and other health plans are paid by the federal government for medicare members among other sources while not allinclusive the following are some of the key provisions of the aca assuming it continues to be implemented in its current form that become effective on or after january 1 2019 the company continues to evaluate these provisions and the related regulations and regulatory guidance to determine the impact that they will have on its business operations and results of operations 

 

the aca also specifies minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for commercial and medicare insured products specifies features required to be included in commercial benefit designs limits commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and significantly increases federal and state oversight of health plans including regulations and processes that could delay or limit the company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates this in turn could adversely affect the company’s ability to continue to participate in certain product lines andor geographies that it serves today 

potential repeal of the aca ongoing legislative regulatory and administrative policy changes to the aca the results of congressional and state level elections the december 2018 us district court decision invalidating the aca and other pending litigation challenging aspects of the law or funding for the law and federal budget negotiations continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the aca the pending litigation challenging the aca includes challenges by various states of the federal government’s decision to curtail payments related to the costsharing subsidy program the time frame for conclusion and final outcome and ultimate impact of this litigation are uncertain given the inherent difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future changes to the aca and how states businesses and individuals will respond to those changes the company cannot predict the impact on it of future changes to the aca it is reasonably possible that invalidation repeal or replacement of or other changes to the aca andor states’ responses to such changes in the aggregate could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations and cash flows 

medicare regulation  the company’s medicare advantage products compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage products offered by other medicare advantage organizations and medicare supplement products offered by other insurers the company’s medicare pdp and medicare supplement products are products that medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage 

the company continues to expand the number of counties in which it offers medicare products the company expects to further expand its medicare service area and products in 2019 and is seeking to substantially grow its medicare membership revenue and results of operations over the next several years including through growth in medicare supplement products the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare products offered and the medicarerelated provisions of the aca significantly increase the company’s exposure to funding and regulation of and changes in government policy with respect to andor funding or regulation of the various medicare programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs andor new reforms or surcharges on existing programs for example since the 2014 contract year the aca has required minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans of 85 if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage contract pays rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms 

the company’s medicare advantage and pdp products are heavily regulated by cms the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other private participants in medicare programs are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example in the second quarter of 2014 cms issued a final rule implementing the aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation payments the company receives from cms for its medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the office of inspector general “oig” and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes 

page 15 

that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the fairness of the company’s medicare reimbursement require the company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit the company’s and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare standards and its medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms may seek premium and other refunds prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to passively enroll members in one or more of the company’s medicare or medicaremedicaid demonstration historically known as “dual eligible” plans exclude us from participating in one or more medicare dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms regulations or its medicare contractual requirements the company’s medicare supplement products are regulated at the state level 

cms regularly audits the company’s performance to determine its compliance with cms’s regulations and its contracts with cms and to assess the quality of services it provides to medicare advantage and pdp beneficiaries for example cms currently conducts risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits of a subset of medicare advantage contracts for each contract year since 2013 cms has selected certain of the company’s medicare advantage contracts for various years for radv audit the oig also is auditing the company’s risk adjustment data and that of other companies and the company expects cms and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data the company also has received civil investigative demands “cids” from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of its patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program 

on october 26 2018 cms issued proposed rules related to among other things changes to the radv audit methodology established by cms in 2012 cms projects that the changes to the radv audit methodology would increase its recoveries from medicare advantage plans as a result of radv audits cms has requested comments on the proposed rules including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audits of medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward the company is evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows if the proposed radv rule change were adopted as proposed cms also has announced its intent to use third party auditors to attain its ultimate goal of subjecting all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year 

a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings” the star rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by cms including quality of preventative services chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of four or more stars out of five stars are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates as a result the company’s medicare advantage plans’ results of operations in 2019 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings the company’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its medicare operations cms released the company’s 2019 star ratings in october 2018 the company’s 2019 star ratings will be used to determine which of its medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2020 based on the company’s membership at december 31 2018 79 of its medicare advantage members were in plans with 2019 star ratings of at least 40 stars cms will release updated stars ratings in october 2019 that will be used to determine which medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2021 cms also gives pdps star ratings which affect pdp’s enrollment and result in contract termination if the pdp is rated less than three stars for three consecutive years cms continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve four stars or more despite the company’s success in maintaining high star ratings and other quality measures for 2019 and the continuation of its improvement efforts there can be no assurances that it will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years accordingly the company’s medicare advantage plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

overall the company projects the benchmark payment rates in cms’s april 2018 final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rates for 2019 the “final notice” will increase funding for the company’s medicare advantage business excluding the impact of coding trend by approximately 25 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 this 2019 rate increase only partially offsets the challenge the company faces from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications and cms local and national coverage decisions that require the company to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into the company’s bids the federal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for medicare advantage andor pdp plans or otherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products the company currently believes that the payments received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify 

page 16 

the company’s continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp programs although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change 

going forward the company expects cms the oig the doj other federal agencies and the united states congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdp demonstration projects such as medicaremedicaid plans and provider network access and adequacy modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ role it is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity any of which could adversely affect the company 

antiremuneration laws   federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state governmentsponsored health care programs companies involved in public health care programs such as medicare andor medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud waste and abuse and are often the subject of fraud waste and abuse investigations and audits the company has invested significant resources to comply with medicare and medicaid program standards ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the company’s compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources 

antitrust and unfair competition  the federal trade commission “ftc” investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand name drug pricing and rebate practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that the company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy cvs specialty or minuteclinic plays a unique or expanded role in a pbm or health care benefits segment product offering the company’s business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements   many of the company’s activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by the company of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii the company uses and discloses deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use andor disclosure of pii 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” as further modified by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” further arra requires us and other covered entities to report any breaches of phi to impacted individuals and to the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to phi criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of arra amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi the hitech act also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates hhs has begun to audit health plans providers and other parties to enforce hipaa compliance including with respect to data security 

in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa including laws that place stricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access to phi states also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the financial modernization act of 1999 also known as the grammleachbliley act “glba” which generally require insurers including health insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic 

page 17 

personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a nonaffiliated third party like hipaa glba sets a “floor” standard allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the company has made to comply with hipaa and glba 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry in addition states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data protection or transparency states also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity such as the regulations issued by the new york department of financial services complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations which may differ from state to state requires significant resources in addition differing approaches to state privacy andor cybersecurity regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines widelyreported large scale commercial data breaches in the united states and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states these legislative and regulatory developments will impact the design and operation of the company’s businesses its privacy and security strategy and its webbased and mobile assets 

finally public exchanges are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the public exchange has implemented for itself or nonpublic exchange entities which include insurers offering plans through the public exchanges and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws   the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the federal trade commission act the federal postal service act the consumer product safety act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws in addition the federal government and most states have adopted laws andor regulations requiring places of public accommodation health care services and other goods and services to be accessible to people with disabilities these consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care products and services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities as a result of the company’s directtoconsumer activities including mobile and webbased solutions offered to members and to other consumers the company also is subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations for example the california consumer privacy act will become effective in 2020 and the company expects additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection to be enacted in 2019 the company expects these new laws and regulations to impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliance costs 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts   certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions

for information regarding restrictions on certain payments of dividends or other distributions by the company’s hmo and insurance company subsidiaries see note 12 ‘‘shareholders’ equity’’  contained in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in the annual report which is incorporated by reference herein 

the holding company laws for the states of domicile of certain of the company’s subsidiaries also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company such as the company’s parent company cvs health corporation that controls an insurance company or hmo or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of another person

the aca expanded the premium rate review process by among other things requiring the company’s commercial insured rates to be reviewed for “reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level hhs established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate increases equal to or exceeding a federally or lower state specified threshold hhs’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as well as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold these combined state and federal review requirements may prevent further delay or otherwise affect the company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes which could adversely affect its mbrs and results of operations particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services andor medical cost trend or when such utilization andor trend exceeds the company’s projections 

the aca also specifies minimum mlrs of 85 for large group commercial products and 80 for individual and small group commercial products because the aca minimum mlrs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing its various restrictions for commercial products states have and may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” incorporate minimum mlr requirements into prospective premium rate filings require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can 

page 25 

earn in its insured commercial business while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

in addition the company requested significant increases in its premium rates in its commercial small group health care benefits business for 2019 and expects to continue to request significant increases in those rates for 2020 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments including the aca the company’s rates also must be adequate to reflect adverse selection in its products particularly in small group commercial products which the company expects to continue and potentially worsen in 2019 these significant rate increases heighten the risks of adverse public and regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

many of the laws and regulations governing the company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other carriers may charge between new and renewal business andor between groups based on differing characteristics they may also require that carriers disclose to customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage in addition hhs’ rules on rates impose additional public disclosure requirements on any rate filings that exceed the “reasonableness” threshold and require additional review of those rates 

medicaid regulation  the company is seeking to substantially grow its medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next several years as a result the company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the company participates including changes in the amounts payable to the company under those programs 

since 2017 managed medicaid products including those the company offers are subject to a minimum mlr of 85 a medicaid managed care quality rating system and provider network adequacy requirements also apply to medicaid products because the minimum mlr is structured as a “floor” states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these various restrictions for managed medicaid products states may adopt higher minimum mlr requirements use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum mlr minimum mlr requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the company can earn in its insured medicaid products while leaving the company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing the company also may be subject to significant fines penalties premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum mlr laws and regulations 

the impact of medicaid expansion under the aca is uncertain the future of the aca is uncertain and states may opt out of the elements of the aca requiring expansion of medicaid coverage without losing their current federal medicaid funding to date a number of states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid coverage to the higher eligibility levels contemplated by the aca in addition the election of new governors andor state legislatures may impact states’ previous decisions regarding medicaid expansion proposals for substantial changes to federal funding of state medicaid programs are likely to be considered in 2019 and beyond including the possibility of converting federal medicaid support to block grants and per capita caps on federal funding uncertainty regarding federal funding is causing and will continue to cause states to reevaluate their medicaid expansions and consider new assessments fees andor taxes on health plans that reevaluation may adversely affect medicaid payment rates the company’s revenues and its medicaid membership in those states 

the economic aspects of the medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change medicaid premiums are paid by each state and differ from state to state the federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation for medicaid and dual eligible program reforms or redesigns including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by medicaid mcos and their contracted pbms further program population andor geographic expansions of riskbased managed care increasing beneficiary costsharing or payment levels and changes to benefits reimbursement eligibility criteria provider network adequacy requirements including requiring the inclusion of specified high cost providers in the company’s networks and program structure in some states current medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not be adequate for the company to continue program participation the company’s medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states or sponsors of medicaid managed care plans are subject to cancellation by the state or the sponsors of the managed care plans after a short notice period without cause for example when a state discontinues a managed care program or in the event of insufficient state funding 

the company’s medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies which have the right to audit the company’s performance to determine compliance with cms 

page 26 

contracts and regulations the company’s medicaid products dual eligible products and chip contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to medicaid enrollees payment for those services network requirements including mandatory inclusion of specified highcost providers and other aspects of these programs and by external review organizations which audit medicaid plans on behalf of the state medicaid agencies the laws regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the company and other participants in medicaid and dual eligible programs including requirements that the company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources cms andor state medicaid agencies may fine the company withhold payments to the company seek premium and other refunds terminate the company’s existing contracts elect not to award the company new contracts or not to renew the company’s existing contracts prohibit the company from continuing to market andor enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the company’s medicaid or dual eligible products exclude the company from participating in one or more medicaid or dual eligible programs andor institute other sanctions andor civil monetary penalties against the company if it fails to comply with cms or state regulations or contractual requirements 

the company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the medicaid program nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or results of operations but the effects could be materially adverse 

state workers’ compensation laws   the company’s workers’ compensation business includes the comparison of medical claims data against the applicable state’s fee schedule pricing including applicable regulations and clinical guidelines state fee schedules which typically represent the maximum reimbursement for medical services provided to the injured worker differ by state and change as state laws and regulations are passed andor amended the company’s workers’ compensation business also includes pbm and care management services both of which are regulated at the state level the company’s workers’ compensation customers include insurance carriers and tpas who also are regulated at the state level the laws and regulations applicable to the company and other participants in the workers’ compensation business are extensive complex and subject to change the company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards and its workers’ compensation compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources the company may be subject to significant fines penalties and litigation if it fails to comply with those laws and regulations 

federal and state reporting  the company is subject to extensive financial and business reporting requirements including penalties for inaccuracies andor omissions at both the federal and state level the company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from third parties that may not be readily available or reliably provided in all instances the company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to comply with these requirements however the company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailability of or errors in its reports 

product design and administration and sales practices   state andor federal regulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration and marketing and advertising practices including the filing of insurance policy forms the adequacy of provider networks the accuracy of provider directories and the adequacy of disclosure regarding products and their administration is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices medicare medicaid and dual eligible products and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny 

guaranty fund assessmentssolvency protection   under guaranty fund laws existing in all states insurers doing business in those states can be assessed in most states up to prescribed limits for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants the life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of longterm care insurers as well as health insurers the company’s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to its health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes some states have similar laws relating to hmos andor other payors such as notforprofit consumer governed health plans established under the aca while historically the company has ultimately recovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative andor regulatory actions that may limit future offsets

overarching risks 

risks to our brand and reputation the aetna acquisition data governance risks effectiveness of our talent management and alignment of talent to our business needs and potential changes in public policy laws and regulations present overarching risks to our enterprise in 2019 and beyond 

we expect to face significant business challenges and uncertainties in 2019 risks to our brand and reputation the aetna acquisition data governance risks effectiveness of our talent management and alignment of talent to our business needs and potential changes in public policy laws and regulations present overarching risks to our enterprise in 2019 and beyond there can be no assurance regarding our ability to avoid harm to our brand and reputation our ability to manage the risks inherent in the aetna acquisition or our data governance risks our ability to manage and align our talent to our business needs or our ability to manage the risks presented by changes in public policy laws or regulations in addition there can be no assurance that the aetna acquisition united states government fiscal policy changes to the united states health care system including changes to the aca to drug reimbursement andor drug pricing laws and regulations andor to laws and regulations governing pbms’ interactions with government funded health care programs or other unanticipated risks will not require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business put us at risk of loss of business or materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

page 28 

our brand and reputation are two of our most important assets negative public perception of the industries in which we operate or of our industries’ or our practices can adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows and prospects 

reputational risk is inherent in many of the risks we face the industries in which we operate regularly are negatively perceived by the public and subject to negative publicity including as a result of adverse media coverage litigation against us and other industry participants the ongoing public debates over drug pricing government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing pbms and the future of the aca governmental hearings andor investigations and actual or perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products andor business practices including pbm operations drug pricing insurance coverage determinations and social media and other media relations activities this risk may be increased as the federal government continues to consider increased involvement in drug reimbursement pricing andor purchasing and changes to the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs and as states seek to maintain replace or repeal elements of the aca such as public exchanges and medicaid expansion within increasingly challenging budget constraints this risk also may be increased as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data and as our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumers significant reductions or interruptions in funding for government health programs we serve also may lead us to reduce our exposure to these programs which could adversely affect our brand and reputation 

negative public perception andor publicity of our industries in general or of us or our key vendors brokers or product distribution networks in particular can further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price by 

 

data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation businesses and prospects our use and disclosure of   members’ customers’ and other constituents’ sensitive information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels we would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or other vendors fail to adequately protect members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information 

our information systems are critical to the operation of our businesses we collect process maintain retain evaluate utilize and distribute large amounts of personal health and financial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers members and other constituents in the ordinary course of our businesses some of our information systems rely upon third party systems to accomplish these tasks the use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal state and international levels and these laws rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity such as the eu’s gdpr which began to apply across the eu during 2018 and the audit program implemented by hhs under hipaa in some cases such laws rules and regulations also apply to our vendors andor may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than in the united states and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach cyberattack or cybersecurity breach and any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member customer or other constituent information whether by us by one of our vendors or by another third party could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our brand and reputation and could also result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation businesses results of operations and cash flows 

our businesses depend on our customers’ and members’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information failing to keep our information technology systems and our members’ customers’ and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of our business associates vendors or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation membership and results of operations and also can andor has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media litigation including class action litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings 

page 29 

material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders adverse actions against our licenses to do business andor injunctive relief any of which could adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations or financial condition large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and of our customers’ members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information there can be no assurance that additional such failures will not occur or if any do occur that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could adversely affect our future performance 

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits if we are unable to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations the succession plans we have in place and our employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

we are subject to potential changes in public policy laws and regulations including reform of the united states health care system that can adversely affect the markets for our products and services and our businesses operations results of operations cash flows and prospects 

the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operations and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing andor purchasing increased regulation of pbms changes to medicare medicaid or the regulatory environment for health care benefits including the aca changes to drug reimbursement andor pricing laws and regulations changes to the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changes to immigration policies andor many other public policy initiatives for example in january 2019 hhs proposed regulations that would exclude from the current safe harbor under the federal antikickback statute manufacturer’s rebates on prescription drugs paid to pbms pdps and managed medicaid organizations in connection with federally funded health care programs it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of united states presidential executive orders other significant changes to health care system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries are also possible and could adversely affect us if we fail to respond adequately to such changes including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our businesses operations and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

in addition to efforts to amend repeal or replace the aca and related regulations we expect the federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and our businesses potential modification to the aca including changes in enforcement andor funding that further destabilize the public exchanges as well as significant changes to medicaid funding could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further changes to federal health care laws including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing laws andor laws governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs are probable we cannot predict the effect if any that new health care legislation future changes to the aca or the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy specialty pharmacy pharmacy services andor health care benefits operations andor results of operations the federal and many state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation enforcement andor application of existing programs laws and regulations including changes to payments under and funding of medicare and medicaid programs 

in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material 

page 30 

adverse effect on our businesses cash flows and results of operations in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade regulations could adversely affect our businesses 

we cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation and regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operations or results of operations which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matters it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we operate examples of such change include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement pricing andor purchasing changing the laws and regulations governing pbms’ pdps’ andor managed medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures and our businesses and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence for more information on these matters see “government regulation” included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise strategy may not be an effective response to the changing dynamics in the industries in which we operate or we may not be able to implement our strategy and related strategic projects 

our strategy includes effectively investing our capital and human resources in appropriate strategic projects current operations and acquisitions to transform our businesses in response to the changing dynamics in the industries in which we operate our strategic projects include among other things integrating the aetna acquisition significant investments in human and technology resources to expand our consumeroriented products and services optimizing our business platforms managing certain significant technology projects further improving relations with manufacturers suppliers and health care providers negotiating contract changes with customers manufacturers suppliers and health care providers and implementing other business process improvements implementing our strategic initiatives will require significant investments of capital and human resources among other things we will need to simultaneously acquire and develop new personnel products and systems to serve existing and new customers with existing and new products and to enhance our existing customer service information technology control and compliance processes and systems the future performance of our businesses will depend in large part on our ability to design and implement our strategic initiatives some of which will occur over several years if these initiatives do not achieve their objectives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our enterprise strategy may not be an effective response to the changing dynamics in the industries in which we operate and we may fail to recognize and position ourselves to capitalize upon market opportunities we may not have sufficient advance notice and resources to develop and effectively implement an alternative strategy if our existing competitors andor new entrants whether vertical horizontal or onlinedigitalecommerce into one or more of our businesses create new disruptive business models andor develop new offerings that customers members andor health care providers prefer to our offerings we may lose customers members andor providers and our results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be adversely affected in addition our results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be adversely affected by consolidation among the participants in the industries in which we operate andor our customer base our businesses and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 

risks related to our businesses 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses 

the continued efforts of hmos mcos pbms government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely affect our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic drugs which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by the introduction of new multisource generic drugs as well as inflation on brand name drugs and by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic drugs with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and in 2019 we expect fewer new multisource generic drugs to be introduced and lower brand name drug inflation than in recent prior years and it is possible that these and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs any inability to offset increased brand name or 

page 31 

generic prescription drug costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are continuing at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices for example we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers including ltc facilities and pharmacies and participants in government funded health care programs a change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant parts of aca also could adversely affect our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effects of any such changes would be 

the aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement rates one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement formula for generic drugs this change has adversely affected the reimbursements we receive when we dispense prescription drugs to medicaid recipients in addition the aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum mlr to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our businesses directly but they could indirectly impact our services business practices andor results of operations 

gross margins in the industries in which we operate may decline 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices increased revenue sharing enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic drug manufacturers and brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer’s rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from drug manufacturers marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes also have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trends to continue further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of pbms drug pricing or purchasing patent term extensions purchase discount andor rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers or additional regulation of pbms formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive in addition changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees could adversely affect our profitability 

our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operations also have been affected by the margin pressures described above including client demands for lower prices generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition as competition increases in the geographies in which we operate including competition from new entrants a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive a shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our margins including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day prescriptions at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions finally the margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements these actions could also adversely affect the margins of our ltc business 

our results of operations are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve 

our businesses are affected by the united states economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve including various economic factors inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns it is possible that an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause a decline in drug utilization an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and 

page 32 

regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms adverse changes in the united states economy consumer confidence and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future andor decrease our prescription volumes 

in addition our health care benefits membership remains concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states and in certain industries unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefits results of operations our health care benefits membership has been and may continue to be affected by workforce reductions by our customers due to adverse andor uncertain general economic conditions especially in the united states geographies and industries where our membership is concentrated as a result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefits membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenue and results of operations may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers 

we operate in a highly competitive business environment competitive and economic pressures may limit our ability to increase pricing to reflect higher costs or may force us to accept lower margins if customers elect to selfinsure reduce benefits or adversely renegotiate or amend their agreements with us our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected we may not be able to obtain appropriate pricing on new or renewal business 

each of our businesses currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment we must compete successfully with existing competitors and new entrants including strategic alliances and online digital and ecommerce companies 

the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business as well as our specialty pharmacy operations with thirdparty payors is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks as a pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets online and other discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs convenience stores and mass merchants some of which are aggressively expanding into markets we serve we also face competition from other retail health care clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively competition may also come from other sources in the future changes in market dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and decisions to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows and prospects 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy operations focus on complex and highcost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories 

the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operations is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations in the geographic regions we serve we compete with pharmerica our largest ltc pharmacy competitor as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by longterm care facilities and local retail pharmacies our ltc pharmacy customers consist of skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent living communities hospitals correctional facilities and other health care service providers one of our growth opportunities is to increase our penetration rate in the assisted living segment where residents can choose which pharmacy will provide them with prescription drugs the ability of a resident of an assisted living facility to select the pharmacy that supplies him or her with prescription drugs could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations because there can be no assurance that such resident will select us 

the competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks competitors in the pbm industry eg the express scripts business of cigna corporation

optumrx prime therapeutics medimpact and humana include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms competition also may come from other sources in the future in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

customer contracts in our health care benefits segment are generally for a period of one year and our customers have considerable flexibility in moving between us and our competitors one of the key factors on which we compete for customers especially in uncertain economic environments is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit costs and increasing operating costs if we are unable to increase our prices to reflect increasing costs our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increases we may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations in response to rising prices our customers may elect to selfinsure or to reduce benefits in order to limit increases in their benefit costs alternatively our customers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable such elections may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured products andor lower premiums for our insured products which may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations although such elections also may reduce our health care and other benefit costs in addition our medicare medicaid and chip products are subject to termination without cause periodic rebid rate adjustment and program redesign as customers seek to contain their benefit costs particularly in an uncertain economy these actions may adversely affect our membership revenues and results of operations 

competitors in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer for example strong competition in the pbm marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

we may lose clients andor fail to win new business if we fail to compete effectively in the geographies and product areas in which we operate including maintaining or increasing membership in our health care benefits segment our results of operations financial condition and cash flows   could be materially and adversely affected 

our pbm business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract our clients are generally well informed and organized can move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could adversely affect our businesses these factors together with the impact of competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to attract new clients retain existing clients and crosssell additional products andor services further the pbm industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future if one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired client’s business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business with respect to our ltc pharmacy business reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities the termination of these agreements generally terminates our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

additionally with respect to our retail and ltc pharmacy businesses reimbursement under medicare part d as well as reimbursement from certain private thirdparty payors is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pbm representatives the loss of those agreements or a material change in the terms of those agreements could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition restricted networks that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacies adversely affect those businesses 

the health care and related benefits industry is highly competitive primarily due to a large number of forprofit and notforprofit competitors our competitors’ marketing and pricing and a proliferation of competing products including new products that are continually being introduced into the marketplace our health care benefits segment faces significant competition in all of the geographies and product areas in which it operates new entrants into the marketplace as well as consolidation within the industry have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment in addition the rapid pace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumerfocused retail marketplace including insurance exchanges and the 

page 34 

increased use of technology to interact with members providers and customers increase the risks we currently face from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors compared to prior periods 

our health care benefits segment competes on the basis of many factors including perceived overall quality quality of service comprehensiveness of coverage cost including premium provider discounts and member outofpocket costs product design financial stability and ratings breadth and quality of provider networks providers available in such networks and quality of member support and care management programs our health care benefits segment’s competitors include among others unitedhealth group incorporated anthem inc humana inc cigna corporation wellcare health plans inc centene corporation molina healthcare inc kaiser permanente health system owned health plans and new entrants into the marketplace and numerous forprofit and notforprofit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross and blue shield association the health care benefits segment’s largest competitor in its medicare products is original medicare additional competitors in this segment’s businesses include other types of medical and dental provider organizations various specialty service providers including pbm services providers health care consultants financial services companies integrated health care delivery organizations networks of providers who also coordinate administrative services for and assume insurance risk of their members tpas hit companies and for certain plans programs sponsored by the federal or state governments emerging competitors include start up health care benefit plans providerowned health plans new joint ventures including forprofit and notforprofit joint ventures among firms from multiple industries technology firms financial services firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary private exchanges consulting firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary private exchanges as well as nontraditional distributors such as retail companies in particular geographies competitors may have greater capabilities resources or membership a more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional pricing and contract terms better business relationships or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage the health care benefits segment competes for sales on insurance exchanges and is developing and expanding its consumer health products and services product and service offerings where we face additional risks from existing and new competitors including our vendors who have lower cost structures greater experience marketing to consumers andor who target the higher margin portions of our business among the health care benefits segment’s international and hit competitors many have longer operating histories better brand recognition and greater market presence in many of the areas in which the segment is seeking to expand and more experience at rapidly innovating products 

there can be no assurance that the aetna acquisition will not adversely affect any of our segments’ respective abilities to attract new clients or retain existing clients or our ability to crosssell additional products andor services within any segment or between segments if we do not compete effectively in the geographies and product areas in which we operate our businesses results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to risks relating to the solvency of our customers and of other insurers 

if our customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing our customers may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations in addition both state and federal government sponsored payers as a result of budget deficits or reductions may suspend payments or seek to reduce their healthcare expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us any delay or reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to assessments under guaranty fund laws for obligations of insolvent insurance companies such as the discounted estimated liability expense of 231 million pretax for our estimated share of future assessments for penn treaty network america insurance company and one of its subsidiaries that aetna recorded in the first quarter of 2017 hmos aca co‑ops and other payors to policyholders and claimants 

we face risks relating to the market availability pricing suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacies and through our pbm’s network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced 

additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can 

page 35 

result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our results of operations and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

further we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers our agreements with these suppliers are often shortterm and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations moreover many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in some cases we depend upon a single source of supply any such supply shortages or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control if our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery including as a result of supply shortages supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

a disruption in our business operations could occur as a result of contamination of drugs a failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage conditions errors in mail order processing the unavailability of prescription drugs provided by suppliers labor disruptions or other unanticipated disruptions at our mail order dispensing pharmacy facilities specialty pharmacy facilities call centers data centers or corporate facilities among other factors such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our customers 

if any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we face risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drugs and brand name prescription drug products 

the profitability of our retailltc and pharmacy services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products because we generally earn higher gross margins on the sale of generic alternatives than on brand name equivalents in addition inflation in the price of brand name drugs can affect utilization particularly given the increase in high deductible health plans accordingly our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected by a slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription drugs andor generic alternatives as well as inflation in the price of brand name drugs for example we project that the operating income of our pharmacy services and retailltc segments may be reduced in 2019 compared to 2018 due in part to fewer new multisource generic drugs being introduced and lower brand name drug price inflation in 2019 than 2018 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm business 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts drug purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs “ffs medicaid” have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and government products future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from our pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with drug manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections the effect of these possible changes on our businesses cannot be predicted at this time 

page 36 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of drugs and consuming drugs in a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide for example we are a defendant in litigation proceedings relating to opioids and the sale of products containing talc our businesses involve the provision of professional services including by pharmacists physician assistants nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims we also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

we face challenges in growing our medicare advantage and medicare part d membership 

we are seeking to substantially grow our medicare advantage and medicare part d membership revenue and results of operations in 2019 and over the next several years including by significantly expanding our medicare advantage service area the organic expansion of our medicare advantage service area is subject to the ability of cms to process our requests for service area expansions and our ability to build cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements cms’ decisions on our requests for service area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations if we are not successful in expanding our medicare advantage service area we may not be able to achieve our medicare advantage growth goals 

we face challenges in growing our medicaid membership and expanding our medicaid membership exposes us to additional risks 

we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan membership over the next several years in many instances to acquire and retain our government customers’ business we must bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment winning bids often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders our ability to maintain and grow membership revenues and results of operations in our medicaid products is dependent on our remaining competitive on price performance and preparing successful bids in cases where a successful bid is challenged we incur defense costs and may incur unreimbursed implementation and other costs to meet contractual deadlines even if we ultimately lose the challenge 

if we are successful in expanding our medicaid membership we may increase our exposure to states that face budgetary pressures hospitals and other providers that face revenue challenges associated with uncompensated care and pressures on our operating margins driven by the projected rapid growth in the size of and cost of care for the medicaid eligible population 

a change in our health care benefits product mix may adversely affect our profit margins 

our insured health care benefits products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc products historically smaller employer groups have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures although recently even relatively small employers have moved to asc products we also serve governmentsponsored programs including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bids and regulatory requirements and have lower profit margins than the insured commercial products in our health care benefits segment although our health care benefits membership is projected to continue to shift towards government products in 2019 the profitability of each of those products differs and may be less than the profitability of an insured commercial product a shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs which could adversely affect our health care benefits segment’s results of operations there can be no assurance that the future health care and other benefit costs of our insured health care benefits products will not exceed our projections 

premiums for our insured health care benefits products which comprised 87 of our health care benefits revenues for 2018 are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period which is generally one year these forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members’ behavior and healthcare utilization patterns and require a significant degree of 

page 37 

judgment for example our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums as a result our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our results of operations 

our health care and other benefit costs can be affected by external events that we cannot forecast or anticipate and over which we have little or no control such as emerging changes in the economy andor public policy additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes changes in our members’ behavior and healthcare utilization patterns changes in health care practices new technologies increases in the cost of prescription drugs influenza related health care costs which may be substantial and were higher than aetna projected in 20172018 directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers clusters of high cost cases epidemics pandemics terrorist attacks or other manmade disasters natural disasters or other events that materially increase utilization of medical andor other covered services including prescription drugs as well as changes in provider billing practices our health care and other benefit costs also can be affected by changes in our business mix product designs contracts with providers medical management underwriting rating andor claims processing methods and processes and our medical management initiatives may not deliver the reduction in utilization andor medical cost trend that we project 

it is particularly difficult to accurately anticipate detect price forecast manage and reserve for medical cost trends and utilization of medical andor other covered services during and following periods when such utilization andor trends are below recent historical levels during periods of changing economic conditions and employment levels and for products with substantial membership growth andor turnover for example as of december 31 2018 we held a premium deficiency reserve of 16 million  for the 2019 coverage year related to our medicaid products we expect utilization to increase in 2019 when compared to 2018 

if health care and other benefit costs are higher than the levels reflected in our pricing or if we are not able to obtain appropriate pricing on new or renewal business our prices will not reflect the risk we assume and our results of operations will be adversely affected if health care and other benefit costs are lower than we predict our prices may be higher than those of our competitors which may cause us to lose health care benefits membership 

a number of factors many of which are beyond our control contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs if we are unable to satisfactorily manage our health care and other benefit costs our health care benefits segment’s results of operations and competitiveness will be adversely affected 

a number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs including previously uninsured members entering the health care system changes in members’ behavior and healthcare utilization patterns turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes changes in the health status of our members the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics advances in medical technology increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs including specialty pharmacy drugs directtoconsumer marketing by drug manufacturers the increasing influence of social media on our members’ utilization and other behavior changes in health care practices and inflation in addition governmentimposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time and future amendments or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include changes as a result of the aca changes to the aca and other changes in the regulatory environment the evolution toward a consumer driven business model changes in health care practices general economic conditions such as inflation and employment levels new technologies influenza related health care costs which may be substantial and were higher than aetna projected in 20172018 clusters of highcost cases epidemics or pandemics health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control 

our health care benefits segment’s results of operations and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect the factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs which can adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

the reserves we hold for expected claims in our insured health care benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be 

page 38 

insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our results of operations could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited 

a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the aca’s cms’s and opm’s minimum mlr rules and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program 

our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns andor procedures turnover and other changes in membership changes in product mix changes in the utilization of medical andor other covered services including prescription drugs changes in medical cost trends changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products we estimate health care costs payable periodically and any resulting adjustments including premium deficiency reserves are reflected in currentperiod results of operations within benefit costs for example as of december 31 2018 we held a premium deficiency reserve of 16 million  for the 2019 coverage year related to our medicaid products a worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of december 31 2018 would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 

furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our results of operations these risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical andor other covered services andor medical cost trends are below recent historical levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risks are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected andor experienced increases in utilization andor medical cost trends 

extreme events or the threat of extreme events could materially increase our health care including behavioral health costs we cannot predict whether or when any such events will occur 

nuclear biological or other attacks whether as a result of war or terrorism other manmade disasters natural disasters epidemics pandemics and other extreme events can affect the united states economy in general our industries and us specifically in particular such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could result in significant health care including behavioral health costs which would also be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and other insurers in addition our employees and those of our vendors are concentrated in certain large metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed to these events such events could adversely affect our businesses cash flows and results of operations and in the event of extreme circumstances our financial condition or viability particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors 

changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

legislative and regulatory changes could create significant challenges to our medicare advantage and medicare part d revenues and results of operations and proposed changes to these programs could create significant additional challenges entitlement program reform if it occurs could have a material adverse effect on our businesses operations andor results of operations 

medicare advantage payment rates to health plans have been cut over the last several years with additional reductions to be phased in through 2019 cms issued the final notice in april 2018 overall we project the benchmark rates in the final notice will increase funding for our medicare advantage business excluding the impact of coding trend by approximately 25 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 this 2019 rate increase only slightly offsets the challenge we face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medications the hif and cms local and national coverage decisions that require us to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into our bids and creates continued pressure on the medicare advantage program and our medicare advantage results of operations we cannot predict future medicare funding levels the impact of future federal budget actions or ensure that such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our medicare results of operations 

page 39 

in addition the “star ratings” from cms for our medicare advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans’ results of operations since 2015 only medicare advantage plans with a star rating of four or higher out of five are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates cms continues to change its rating system to make achieving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult our star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in our medicare operations if our star ratings fall below 4 for a significant portion of our medicare advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated our revenues and results of operations may be significantly adversely affected 

payments we receive from cms for our medicare advantage and part d businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals we enroll elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cms itself substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions could materially affect the fairness of our medicare reimbursement require us to raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to medicare beneficiaries and potentially limit our and the industry’s participation in the medicare program 

medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of the aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules clients of our pbm could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our medicare part d business if changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies if the government alters medicare part d program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if the government mandates the use of pointofsale manufacturer’s rebates or up front drug pricing discounts makes drug manufacturer’s rebates illegal or makes changes to how pharmacy payforperformance is calculated or if reinsurance thresholds are reduced below their current levels our medicare part d results of operations and our ability to expand our medicare part d business could be adversely affected 

more generally our medicare results of operations and our ability to expand our medicare membership and revenues also could be adversely affected if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare advantage or part d participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective actions or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare’s competitive bidding process 

federal funding for expanded medicaid coverage began to decrease in 2017 this reduction is causing states to reevaluate funding for their medicaid expansions that reevaluation may adversely affect medicaid payment rates our medicaid membership in those states our revenues our mbrs and our results of operations 

we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increases in our insured health care benefits products which would have an adverse effect on our revenues mbrs and results of operations and could magnify the adverse impact of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of aca assessments fees and taxes 

premium rates for our insured health care benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval which creates risk for us in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires a review by hhs in conjunction with state regulators of premium rate increases that exceed a federally specified threshold or lower statespecific thresholds set by states determined by hhs to have adequate processes rate reviews can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins and results of operations of increases in health care and other benefit costs increased utilization of covered services and aca assessments fees and taxes by restricting our ability to reflect these increases andor these assessments fees and taxes in our pricing the risk of increases in utilization of medical andor other covered services andor in health care and other benefit costs is particularly acute during and following periods when utilization has been below recent historical levels during periods of changing economic conditions andor employment levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year further our ability to reflect aca assessments fees and taxes in our medicare rates is limited similarly our ability to reflect them in our medicaid andor chip premium rates is limited due among other things to the budgetary pressures currently facing many state governments this could magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins and results of operations of increases in utilization of medical and other covered services health care and other benefit costs andor medical cost trends that exceed our projections 

page 40 

since 2013 hhs has issued determinations to health plans that their rate increases were “unreasonable” and we continue to experience challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in certain states regulators or legislatures in a number of states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rate increases either by enforcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards regulators or legislatures in a number of states also have conducted hearings on proposed premium rate increases which can result in some instances have resulted in substantial delays in implementing proposed rate increases even if they ultimately are approved our plans can be excluded from participating in small group public exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” rate increases we requested significant increases in our premium rates in our small group commercial health care benefits products for 2019 and expect to continue to request significant increases in those rates for 2020 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends required expansions of coverage and significant assessments fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments including the aca our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selected by people with a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established the pricing for the applicable products also known as “adverse selection” in our products particularly in small group products which we expect to continue and potentially worsen in 2019 following the expiration of the aca’s risk corridor and reinsurance programs at the end of 2016 these significant rate increases heighten the risks of adverse public and regulatory reaction and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression 

we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our insured health care benefits products we may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in any product line or geography if we are unable to obtain adequate rates andor rate increases it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and our ability to earn adequate returns on insured health care benefits business in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies andor products 

minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefits products while leaving us exposed to higher than expected medical costs challenges to our minimum mlr rebate methodology andor reports could adversely affect our results of operations 

the aca requires us to pay minimum mlr rebates each year with respect to prior years the aca’s minimum mlr rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our commercial insured and medicare insured businesses cms minimum mlr rebate regulations limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portions of our health care benefits medicaid and fehb program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebates payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirements are detailed federal and state auditors are challenging our commercial health care benefits business’ compliance with the aca’s minimum mlr requirements as well as our fehb plans’ compliance with the opm’s fehb programspecific minimum mlr requirements our medicare and medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum mlr audits if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms additional challenges to our methodology andor reports relating to minimum mlr and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible the outcome of these audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business activities are highly regulated our pharmacy services medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs plan small group and certain other products are subject to particularly extensive and complex regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions or suffer brand and reputational harm which may have a material adverse effect on our businesses compliance with existing and future laws regulations andor judicial decisions may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state federal and international governmental authorities the laws and regulations governing our operations and interpretations of those laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflicting in general these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers members and providers rather than us or our investors in addition the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year in connection with the aetna acquisition we also agreed to undertakings with certain state regulators that place various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries

our health care benefits products are highly regulated particularly those that serve medicare medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs and small group commercial customers and members the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for noncompliance including penalties under the false claims act and state false claims acts in addition the aca may have expanded the jurisdiction of and our exposure to the false claims act to products that are sold on public exchanges or otherwise subject to the aca the scope of the practices and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit and we are a defendant in a number of such proceedings if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the false claims act we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs including medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs and we also may be required to pay significant fines andor other monetary penalties 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations that apply to government programs we could be subject to criminal fines civil penalties premium refunds prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part d medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special needs plan and other programs cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses profitability and growth also may be adversely affected by i judicial and regulatory decisions that change andor expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations impose medical or bad faith liability increase our responsibilities under erisa or the remedies available under erisa or reduce the scope of erisa preemption of state law claims or ii other legislation and regulations 

if our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatory actions or litigation which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive and complex regulations and many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements in order to be eligible to offer certain products or bid on certain contracts we must demonstrate that we have robust systems in place to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal regulatory and contractual requirements these systems frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers and regulators if our systems and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements and to prevent and detect instances of or the potential for noncompliance fail or are deemed inadequate we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions litigation and other proceedings which may result in damages fines suspension or loss of licensure suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs andor other penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as a result of the aetna acquisition and as we offer new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical core businesses of retailltc and pharmacy services 

historically we focused primarily on providing retailltc and pharmacy services products and services as a result of the aetna acquisition we have significantly expanded our presence in health care benefits products and services including 

page 42 

products and services offered in multiple countries outside of the united states which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically have offered 

the increased volume of business in areas beyond our historical core business and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that are different from the risks of providing retailltc and pharmacy services products and services and increase significantly our exposure to other risks 

we routinely are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings including class actions and qui tam actions many of these proceedings seek substantial damages which may not be covered by insurance these proceedings may be costly to defend result in changes in our business practices harm our brand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

pharmacy services retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and health care benefits are highly regulated and litigious industries we are currently subject to various litigation matters investigations regulatory audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and other legal proceedings litigation and particularly securities collective or class action and qui tam litigation is often expensive and disruptive certain of the lawsuits against us are or are purported to be class actions or  qui tam actions litigation related to our provision of professional services in our pharmacies specialty pharmacies medical clinics and ltc facilities also has increased as we expand our services along the continuum of health care 

the majority of these proceedings relate to the conduct of our retailltc pharmacy services and health care benefits operations and allege various violations of law in addition we operate in jurisdictions outside the united states where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states and are therefore more likely to be subject to dispute by customers members governmental authorities and others we are incurring expenses to resolve these proceedings the outcome of litigation and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law or regulation can and do occur 

litigation has been and may be brought against us by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit under the provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state health care programs including medicare and medicaid and we are a defendant in a number of such proceedings when a private individual brings a whistleblower suit the defendant often will not be made aware of the suit for many months or even years until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies the significant incentives and protections provided under the financial reform act increase the risk of whistleblower suits 

many of the legal proceedings against us seek substantial damages including noneconomic or punitive damages and treble damages and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in our business practices while we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses or results of operations because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the costs of defending such proceedings the costs of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings see item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in material refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities and other sanctions 

as one of the largest national retail and ltc pharmacy pharmacy services and health care benefits providers we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental market conduct and other audits investigations and reviews by and we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from various federal and state agencies regulatory authorities attorneys general committees subcommittees and members of the united states congress and other state federal and international governmental authorities for example we have received cids from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the 

page 43 

doj in cooperation with a current investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program several such audits investigations and reviews currently are pending some of which may be resolved in 2019 and the results of which may be adverse to us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members billing for unnecessary medical andor other covered services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources in addition our medical costs and the medical expenses of our health care benefits asc customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by providers andor members 

regular and special governmental audits investigations and reviews by federal state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices and also could result in significant or material premium refunds fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure any of these audits investigations or reviews could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or businesses or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for our company for example since 2013 cms has selected certain of the company’s medicare advantage contracts for various years for radv audit in addition federal and state auditors are challenging our commercial health care benefits business’ compliance with the aca’s minimum mlr requirements as well as our fehb plans’ compliance with opm’s fehb programspecific minimum mlr requirements our medicare and medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum mlr audits if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to enroll new members if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by cms 

we are subject to retroactive adjustments to andor withholding of certain premiums and fees including as a result of cms radv audits we generally rely on health care providers to appropriately code claim submissions and document their medical records if these records do not appropriately support our risk adjusted premiums we may be required to refund premium payments to cms andor pay fines and penalties under the false claims act 

premiums andor fees for medicare members certain federal government employee groups and medicaid beneficiaries are subject to retroactive adjustments andor withholding by the federal and applicable state governments our business that is subject to the aca including amounts payable to us or payable by us under the aca’s premium stabilization programs and our risk adjustment and reinsurance data also is subject to audit by governmental authorities cms regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with cms’s regulations and our contracts with cms and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our medicare members 

cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to our and other companies’ medicare plans by considering the applicable health status of medicare members as supported by information prepared maintained and provided by health care providers we collect claim and encounter data from providers and generally rely on providers to appropriately code their submissions to us and document their medical records including the diagnosis data submitted to us with claims cms pays increased premiums to medicare advantage plans and pdps for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes 

federal regulators review and audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and the resulting riskadjusted premium payments to us in that regard cms has instituted radv audits of a subset of medicare advantage plans for various contract years including certain of our plans for various contract years to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by health care providers and the resulting risk adjusted premium payments to the plans cms may require us to refund premium payments if our risk adjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data the oig also is auditing our risk adjustment data and that of other companies and we expect cms and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data we also have received cids from and provided documents and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with a current investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under parts c and d of the medicare program 

in 2012 cms revised its audit methodology for radv audits to determine refunds payable by medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward under the revised methodology among other things cms will project the error rate identified 

page 44 

in the audit sample of approximately 200 members to all risk adjusted premium payments made under the contract being audited for contract years prior to 2011 cms did not project sample error rates to the entire contract as a result the revised methodology may increase our exposure to premium refunds to cms based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers on october 26 2018 cms issued proposed rules related to among other things changes to the radv audit methodology established by cms in 2012 cms projects that the changes to the radv audit methodology would increase its recoveries from medicare advantage plans as a result of radv audits cms has requested comments on the proposed rules including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audits of medicare advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward we are evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows if the proposed radv rule change were adopted as proposed cms also has announced its intent to use third party auditors to attain its ultimate goal of subjecting all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year we are currently unable to predict which of our medicare advantage contracts will be selected for future audit the amounts of any retroactive refunds of or prospective adjustments to medicare advantage premium payments made to us the effect of any such refunds or adjustments on the actuarial soundness of our medicare advantage bids or whether any radv audit findings would require us to change our method of estimating future premium revenue in future bid submissions to cms or compromise premium assumptions made in our bids for prior contract years the current contract year or future contract years 

if we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a cms audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines civil monetary penalties or other sanctions including fines and penalties under the false claims act which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage part d or other government programs and on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

cms has issued a final rule implementing aca requirements that medicare advantage and pdp plans report and refund to cms overpayments that those plans receive from cms however cms’s statements in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to medicare advantage plans appear to be inconsistent with cms’s prior radv audit guidance these statements appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the fee for service adjustment comparison contemplated by cms’s radv audit methodology the precise interpretation impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation if medicare advantage plans were not paid based on payment model principles that align with the requirements of the social security act or such payments were not implemented correctly it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

certain of our medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and in part to set premium rates we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate or to correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the medicaid premium rates we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to us which could have a material adverse effect on our medicaid results of operations and cash flows andor our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid programs 

any premium or fee refunds adjustments or withholding or civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions on or changes in the way we do business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs resulting from regulatory audits or investigations whether as a result of radv public exchange related recovery audit program or other audits or investigations by cms the oig hhs the doj or otherwise including audits of our minimum mlr rebates methodology andor reports could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

programs funded in whole or in part by the us federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues the us federal government and our other government customers may reduce funding for health care or other programs cancel or decline to renew contracts with us or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs the services provided to enrollees in such programs our premiums and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and cash flows in addition an extended federal government shutdown or a delay by congress in raising the federal government’s debt ceiling could lead to a delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a 

page 45 

significant increase in interest rates that could in turn have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and cash flows 

programs funded in whole or in part by the united states federal government account for a significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase as our government funded businesses grow our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to andor regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases 

our revenues from government funded programs including our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses and our government customers in our commercial business are dependent on annual funding by the federal government andor applicable state or local governments federal state and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities 

for example cms is transitioning the process of calculating medicare members’ risk scores from using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to using diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires medicare advantage plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit claims that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires medicare advantage plans to submit all encounter data and cms applies the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2019 25 of the risk score will be calculated from claims data submitted through eds up from 15 in 2018 for 2020 the eds percentage will increase to 50 the transition from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition while the aca provided substantial federal funding for the expansion of the number of people who qualify to enroll in medicaid beginning in 2014 that funding began to decrease in 2017 and the future of that funding is uncertain as a result in 2019 states are preparing for the adverse impact on their budgets and programs by seeking to reduce their medicaid expenditures andor changing the design of their medicaid programs these changes could have a material adverse effect on the revenues medical benefit ratios and results operations of our medicaid contracts andor our ability to grow our medicaid membership revenues and results of operations 

our government customers also determine the eligibility criteria premium levels and other aspects of medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs that affect the number of persons enrolled in these programs the services provided to enrollees under these programs the conditions for participating in these programs and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs under these programs for example states may require participation on their public exchange as a condition to participating in their medicaid or state employee health benefit programs andor take program design actions that shift provider costs from state employee plans to commercial and medicare plans in the past determinations of this type have at times adversely affected our results of operations from and willingness to participate in such programs and they may do so again in the future if a government customer reduces premium levels or increases premiums by less than the increase in our costs such as by not allowing us to recover aca and other applicable fees taxes and assessments and we cannot offset the adverse impact of these actions with supplemental premiums andor changes in benefit plans then our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if states allow certain programs to expire reduce the number of firms with which they contract for managed medicaid services or choose to opt out of medicaid expansion we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment or reduced medicaid enrollment growth which would adversely affect our businesses revenues and results of operations 

the federal government’s “debt ceiling” or the amount of debt the federal government is permitted to borrow to meet its legal obligations including among other things interest on the national debt medicare and medicaid premiums and contributions to the fehb program is limited by statute and can only be raised by an act of congress 

during a federal government shutdown or if congress does not raise the debt ceiling before the federal government’s current obligations approach or exceed its cash on hand and incoming receipts federal government spending may be subject to delay reduction suspension or cancellation which may be prolonged over 30 of our health care benefits segment’s revenues are derived from health care coverage programs that are funded in whole or in part by the federal government including the medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible specials needs plan programs chip and the fehb program when federal spending is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive claims from providers providing services to beneficiaries of these programs and we remain liable for and are required to fund such claims a federal government shutdown or a failure to 

page 46 

timely raise the debt ceiling could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows brand and reputation and in the case of a prolonged shutdown or failure to raise the debt ceiling our financial condition 

if the united states defaults on its obligations due to a failure to timely raise the debt ceiling or otherwise or its credit rating is downgraded by any of the credit rating agencies interest rates could rise financial markets could become volatile andor the availability of credit and shortterm credit in particular could be adversely affected thereby increasing our borrowing costs adversely affecting the value of our investment portfolio andor adversely affecting our ability to access the capital markets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could adversely affect our liquidity 

our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity 

the federal and certain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business including increased minimum wages and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave in addition our employee related operating costs may be increased by union organizing activity if we are unable to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases our results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to customer perceptions of our products and services 

we must develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our retail customers 

our business has evolved from a retail store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining mobile commerce applications for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

we must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services including proprietary brands if we fail to develop new products differentiate our products from those of our competitors or demonstrate the value of our products to our customers and members our ability to retain or grow our customer base may be adversely affected 

the success of our businesses depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in our markets an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and clients and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our retail business results of operations and financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner 

page 47 

is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty 

our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients as a result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business results of operations and cash flows 

we operate in rapidly evolving industries our customers generally and our larger customers in particular are wellinformed and organized and along with our individual customers can easily move between us and our competitors these factors require us to differentiate our products and solutions anticipate changes in customer and consumer preferences anticipate and effectively compete with the products and solutions of new and existing competitors and innovate and deliver new and existing products and solutions that demonstrate value to our customers and members particularly in response to marketplace changes from public policy any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to retain or grow customers andor profitable medical membership which can adversely affect our results of operations 

in order to be competitive in the increasingly consumeroriented marketplace for our health care products and services we will need to develop and deploy consumerfriendly products and services and make investments in consumer engagement reduce our cost structure and compete successfully with new entrants into our businesses if we are unsuccessful our future growth and profitability may be adversely affected 

historically employers have been the most significant customers driving purchases of our pharmacy services and health care benefits segments however decisions to buy our pharmacy services and health care benefits products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers either through direct purchasing for example medicare advantage plans and pdps or through insurance exchanges that allow individual choice similarly consumers increasingly seek to access health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile devices and our websites in response to this demand we are expanding our consumer focus to compete effectively in the consumerdriven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences 

we also will have to respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors as well as potentially disruptive new entrants regulatory and participation requirements for insurance exchangebased plans tend to emphasize price and make competitive differentiation of our health care benefits products and services based on other attributes more difficult price competition from existing and potentially new disruptive competitors in the industries in which each of our segments compete also continues to increase accordingly we face competitive pricing pressures from existing and new competitors including our vendors and others who may have lower cost structures than we do and these pressures may reduce our operating margins or limit sales of our products and services our competitors may bring their consumeroriented products and services to market more quickly have greater experience marketing to consumers andor may be targeting the higher margin portions of our businesses these risks may be enhanced if employers shift to defined contribution health care benefits plans and make greater utilization of private exchanges or encourage their employees to purchase health insurance on the public exchanges we can provide no assurance that we will be able to develop or operate successful or profitable consumeroriented products and services or that our health care benefits segment will be able to compete successfully or profitably on public exchanges or private exchanges or benefit from any opportunities presented by public exchanges or private exchanges or that we will be able to benefit from opportunities available to any of our segments in the industries in which we operate if we do not develop and expand competitive and profitable consumer products are not competitive in the industries in which we operate or are unsuccessful in reducing our cost structure our future growth and profitability may be adversely affected 

risks related to our relationships with manufacturers providers suppliers and vendors 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with manufacturers providers suppliers and vendors on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networks with high quality providers 

our pbm business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members as a result we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers we acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers our agreements with these suppliers often are shortterm and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the 

page 48 

agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than the company a termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

we are seeking to enhance our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risksharing arrangements with health care providers providers’ willingness to enter these arrangements with us depends upon among other things our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these valuebased contracts these arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our members these arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies target new customer groups increase membership and reduce medical costs and if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative sources if such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customers may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow membership and our ability to profitably grow our business andor our results of operations may be adversely affected 

while we believe joint ventures acos and other nontraditional health care provider organizational structures present opportunities for us the implementation of our joint ventures and other nontraditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows among other things joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rates that make the joint ventures economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint venture we may not be able to achieve these objectives in one or more of our joint ventures which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

if our service providers fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation or regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs 

we contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems our arrangements with these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations for example certain of our vendors have been responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members and employees which has caused us to incur additional expenses and given rise to litigation against us 

these risks are particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs where third parties perform pbm medical management and other member related services for us any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policies data security andor cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to members’ customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceedings prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members corrective actions fines sanctions andor penalties any of which could adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs make it difficult for us to compete in certain geographies and create new competitors 

hospitals and other providers and health systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and has the potential to improve the delivery of health care services it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies these health systems also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us a process that has been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaidonly acos developed as a result of state medicaid laws practice management companies consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other health care providers adopt continues to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate these changes may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs and may require us to change our operations including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses or are unable to collaborate or contract with providers on acceptable terms each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

page 49 

we may experience increased medical and other benefit costs litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not have contracts with us render services to our health care benefits members 

some providers that render services to our health care benefits members do not have contracts with us in those cases we do not have a preestablished understanding with these providers as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members in some states the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating providers is defined by law or regulation but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms in such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example on october 15 2018 an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately 150 million in a proceeding relating to aetna’s outofnetwork benefit payment and administration practices such disputes may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

risks related to our operations 

customers particularly large sophisticated customers expect us to implement their contracts and onboard their employees and members efficiently and effectively failure to do so could adversely affect our reputation businesses results of operations cash flows and prospects if we or our vendors fail to provide our customers with quality service that meets their expectations our ability to retain and grow our membership and customer base will be adversely affected 

our ability to attract and retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective quality customer service operations such as call center operations pbm functions retail pharmacy and ltc services home delivery pharmacy prescription delivery specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claims processing customer case installation and online access and tools that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations as we seek to reduce general and administrative expenses we must balance the potential impact of costsaving measures on our customer and other service and performance if we misjudge the effects of such measures customer and other service may be adversely affected we depend on third parties for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operations if we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations we may have difficulty retaining or profitable growing our customer base andor membership which can adversely affect our results of operations for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach involving one of our third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations brand and reputation 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these vendors are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems we use if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations 

our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and results of operations 

we and our vendors are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks including natural disasters utility and other mechanical failures acts of war or terrorism disruption of communications data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulties the occurrence of any of these or other events to the company or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect our operations we may also be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such events although we 

page 50 

have developed procedures for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policies include limits and as such our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our businesses in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans may not be effective should any such hazards or risks occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we and our vendors have experienced cyber attacks we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future 

we and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience a variety of cyber attacks and we and our vendors expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward among other things we and our vendors have experienced automated attempts to gain access to our public facing networks brute force syn flood and distributed denial of service attacks attempted malware infections vulnerability scanning ransomware attacks spearphishing campaigns mass reconnaissance attempts injection attempts phishing php injection and crosssite scripting we also have seen an increase in attacks designed to obtain access to consumers’ accounts using illegally obtained demographic information although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations through december 31 2018 we can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security including cybersecurity risks or threats in the future as we expand our consumeroriented products and services increase the amount and types of data we acquire generate and use increase the amount of information we make available to members consumers and providers on mobile devices expand our use of vendors expand internationally and expand our use of social media our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risks including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access to andor disruption of our systems and the customer member provider employee aco joint venture vendor and other third party information they contain increases and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases 

although we deploy a layered approach to address information security including cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that is designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to a cyberincident are significant large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our members’ and customers’ sensitive information following a cyberincident our andor our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful and a cyberincident could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and members in addition breaches of our andor our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers our members or other thirdparties could expose our customers’ and members’ private information and our customers and members to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigations regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties loss of customers litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses brand reputation cash flows and results of operations 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses could adversely affect our reputation businesses results of operations and cash flows 

our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches cyber attacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm 

page 51 

claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in united states and foreign privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

our business success and results of operations depend in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing extracare customer loyalty program finance and other processes throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii and phi that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 

we have many different information and other technology systems supporting our businesses including as a result of our acquisitions our businesses depend in large part on these systems to adequately price our products and services accurately establish reserves process claims and report results of operations and interact with providers employer plan sponsors members and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices certain of our technology systems including software are older legacy systems that are less flexible less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resources to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems we must reengineer and reduce the number of these systems to meet changing consumer and vendor preferences and needs improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses we also need to develop or acquire new technology systems contract with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumeroriented products and services we are developing operating and expanding andor to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standards including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats if we fail to achieve these objectives our ability to profitably grow our business andor our results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business strategy involves providing customers with differentiated easy to use secure products and solutions that use information to meet customer needs the types of technology and levels of service that are acceptable to customers and members today will not necessarily be acceptable in the future requiring us to anticipate and meet marketplace demands for technology our success therefore is dependent in large part on our ability within the context of a limited budget of human resources and capital and our existing and future business relationships to timely secure integrate develop redesign and enhance our or contract with vendors to provide technology systems that support our business strategy initiatives and processes in a compliant secure and cost and resource efficient manner integration of our acquisitions increases these challenges and we may not be successful in integrating various systems in a timely or costeffective manner 

information technology projects frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced systems we could among other things have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimates andor establishing appropriate pricing meeting the needs of customers providers and members developing and expanding our consumeroriented products and services or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent thirdparty brokers consultants and agents new distribution channels create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result of the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling our products 

our products are sold primarily through our sales personnel who frequently work with independent brokers consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent brokers consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend andor market health care benefits products of our competitors accordingly we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sales personnel and thirdparty brokers consultants and agents or if we do not adequately 

page 52 

provide support training and education to this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels this risk is heightened as we develop operate and expand our consumer health products and services products and services and our business model evolves to include a greater focus on consumers and directtoconsumer sales such as competing for sales on insurance exchanges 

new distribution channels for our products and services continue to emerge including private exchanges operated by health care consultants and technology companies these channels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their health care benefits in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplace entrants that could interfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas 

in addition there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive these investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies’ products for example cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans andor changes to industry practices which could adversely affect our ability to market our products 

we also face other risks that could adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows which include 

 

financial risks 

goodwill and other intangible assets could in the future become impaired 

as of december 31 2018 we had 1152 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2018 we took 61 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our ltc reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelylived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we would be adversely affected if we do not effectively deploy our capital    downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings should they occur could adversely affect our brand and reputation businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our operations generate significant capital and we have the ability to raise additional capital the manner in which we deploy our capital including investments in our businesses our operations such as information technology and other strategic and capital projects dividends acquisitions share andor debt repurchases repayment of debt reinsurance or other capital uses impacts our financial strength claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by recognized rating organizations credit ratings issued by nationallyrecognized organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughout our industries our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds we believe our credit ratings and the financial strength and claims paying ability of 

page 53 

our principal insurance and hmo subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our health care benefits products to certain of our customers 

each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future in connection with the completion of the aetna acquisition each of standard  poor’s moody’s and fitch downgraded certain of our debt financial strength andor other credit ratings downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

adverse conditions in the us and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities mortgage loans alternative investments and other investments our results of operations andor our financial condition 

the global capital markets including credit markets continue to experience volatility and uncertainty as an insurer we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the united states as a result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the united states and to a lesser extent the international financial markets and volatility uncertainty andor disruptions in the global capital markets particularly the united states credit markets and governments’ monetary policy particularly united states monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our results of operations andor our financial condition by 

 

although we seek within guidelines we deem appropriate to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures a failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstances our cash flows 

risks relating to our acquisition of aetna 

we have limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry which may hinder our ability to achieve our objectives as a combined company 

we have limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business and are relying in large part on the existing management of aetna to continue to manage our health care benefits business however there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to retain the services of such management if we fail to retain the existing management of aetna our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction may be adversely affected 

the aetna acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may adversely affect our stock price 

although we currently project that the aetna acquisition will result in a number of benefits including that it will be accretive to our earnings per share changes in the estimates we use for these projections and the impact of future events and conditions some of which we do not control could cause actual results to be lower than these projections in addition future events and 

page 54 

conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution these events and conditions include adverse changes in market conditions changes in the regulatory environment additional transaction and integrationrelated costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the aetna acquisition any dilution of decrease in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause our stock price to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

we may fail to successfully combine the businesses and operations of cvs health and aetna to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the aetna acquisition within the anticipated timeframe or at all which could adversely affect our stock price 

the success of the aetna acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of cvs health and aetna our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including 

  

 

if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of cvs health and aetna within the anticipated time frame the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the aetna acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected the combined businesses may not perform as expected and our stock price may be adversely affected 

until the completion of the aetna acquisition we and aetna operated independently and there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key cvs health or aetna employees the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of cvs health and aetna in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the aetna acquisition so the combined business performs as expected include among other things 

 

in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management and our resources will be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from daytoday business operations which may adversely affect our businesses 

page 55 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following completion of the aetna acquisition 

following completion of the aetna acquisition our business is significantly larger than the size of either cvs health’s or aetna’s respective pretransaction businesses the combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and its ability to manage a combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the aetna acquisition if we are not able to fully realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits anticipated from the aetna acquisition or such benefits take longer to realize than expected our combined businesses may not perform as expected and our stock price may be adversely affected 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees following completion of the aetna acquisition 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to retain key executives and other employees of aetna uncertainty about the effect of the aetna acquisition on cvs health and aetna employees may have an adverse effect on the combined company and consequently the combined business this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process as employees of cvs health and aetna may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business 

furthermore if key employees of cvs health or aetna depart or are at risk of departing including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration financial security or a desire not to remain as employees of the combined business we may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of aetna and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the aetna acquisition may be materially and adversely affected accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees of aetna to the same extent that aetna was able to attract or retain employees in the past 

the aetna integration process could disrupt our ongoing businesses andor operations 

parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the aetna acquisition andor the postclosing integration process including with respect to current or future business relationships with the combined business our business relationships including business relationships of our health care benefits segment may be subject to disruption as customers members manufacturers providers vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the combined business these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of one or more of the combined company’s businesses including a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the aetna acquisition 

our indebtedness following completion of the aetna acquisition is substantially greater than our indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of cvs health and aetna existing prior to the announcement of the transaction this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

in order to complete the aetna acquisition we incurred acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 450 billion and assumed aetna’s existing indebtedness with a fair value of approximately 81 billion our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following completion of the aetna acquisition in comparison to that of cvs health prior to the aetna acquisition has the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increases our interest expense compared to pre aetna acquisition periods in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the indebtedness of cvs health or aetna individually prior to the aetna acquisition the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available to fund our efforts to combine our business with aetna and realize expected benefits of the aetna acquisition andor engage in investments in product development capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

page 56 

we will continue to incur significant integrationrelated costs in connection with the aetna acquisition 

we expect to continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of cvs health and aetna we expect to continue to incur significant integrationrelated costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses we may not achieve the net benefit of such expenditures that we project associated with the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of our businesses in the near term or at all if we fail to realize the expected expense and other efficiencies we project our results of operations cash flows and stock price may be adversely affected 

risks related to our acquisitions joint ventures and international operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities which may be unsuccessful cause us to assume unanticipated liabilities disrupt our existing businesses be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy in addition to integration risks some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include 

 

we expect joint ventures to be an important part of our business model transformation and inorganic growth strategies joint ventures present risks that are different from acquisitions including selection of appropriate joint venture parties initial and ongoing governance of the joint venture joint venture compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the joint venture’s business in a manner acceptable to all the parties including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures maintaining positive relationships among the joint venture parties and the customers and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination 

page 57 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies we acquire 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company may also be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations furthermore acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or geographic markets and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

as a result of our expanded international operations we face political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that we do not face or are more significant than in our domestic operations 

we significantly expanded our international operations as a result of the closing of the aetna acquisition in november 2018 as a result of our expanded international operations we face political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations these risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints our international products need to meet countryspecific customer and member preferences as well as countryspecific legal requirements including those related to licensing privacy data storage location protection and security 

our international operations increase our exposure to and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of nonus jurisdictions and the antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws of the united states including the fcpa and the united kingdom including the uk bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions implementing our compliance policies internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable management time and management financial and other resources over a number of years before any significant revenues or profits are generated violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we must regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our businesses and operations our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations financial condition brand reputation andor longterm growth 

our international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages cultures legal and regulatory schemes and time zones our international operations encounter labor laws standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate in some countries we are required to or choose to operate with local business associates which requires us to manage our relationships with these third parties and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges 

page 58 

in some countries we may be exposed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting local currencies into us dollars or other currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues results of operations and cash flows from our international operations some of our operations are and are increasingly likely to be in emerging markets where these risks are heightened any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective

pharmacy services seasonality  the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature however our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a members cumulative annual outofpocket costs the benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year as a result the pdp pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses

retail pharmacy business strategy  our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and recommending more cost effective drug therapies we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we are continuing to leverage digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime anywhere we are continuing to introduce digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives in 2017 we rolled out cvs pay ®   nationwide an endtoend mobile payment solution that integrates payment prescription pickup and our extracare ® loyalty program into one spot at checkout we believe that continuing to innovate with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

 

  

retailltc products and services  a typical retail store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics personal care products convenience foods photo finishing services seasonal merchandise and greeting cards the pharmacies within target stores sell prescription drugs and overthecounter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter the ltc operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals and related consulting and ancillary services we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business our clinics offer a variety of health care services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants

laws and regulations related to each operating segment of our business 

  

laws related to reimbursement by government programs  we are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties multiples damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act “fca” the federal antikickback statute various state false claims acts and antikickback statutes the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the fca prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs as part of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “aca” the federal antikickback statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the fca where it results from a violation of the antikickback statute most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the fca and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government further the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

  

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs 

  

antitrust and unfair competition  the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy or cvs specialty plays a unique or expanded role in a pbm product offering our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties 

  

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit   credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi it also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

 

  

finally the health insurance marketplaces formerly known as the “exchanges” are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the health insurance marketplace has implemented for itself or nonhealth insurance marketplace entities which include insurers offering plans through the health insurance marketplaces and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

  

consumer protection laws  the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the ftca the federal postal service act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws these laws have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected 

  

government agreements and mandates  the company andor its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees settlement agreements corrective action plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices controlled substances medicare part d prescription drug plans expired products environmental and safety matters marketing and advertising practices pbm long term care and pharmacy operations and various other business practices these agreements may contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company failure to meet the company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies financial penalties administrative remedies andor exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 

  

environmental and safety regulation  our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment public health and employee safety including for example regulations governing the management of hazardous substances the cleaning up of contaminated sites and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores distribution centers and other facilities governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

  

health reform legislation  passed in 2010 aca affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients as a result these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices some significant aca provisions are still being finalized eg implementation of the excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage has been delayed by congress and parts of aca may still face potential congressional changes so the full impact of aca on our company is still uncertain 

  

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation  we are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs operation of retail specialty infusion ltc and mail order pharmacies licensure of facilities and professionals including pharmacists technicians and nurses registration of facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances packaging storing shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals repackaging of drug products labeling medication guides and other consumer disclosures interactions with prescribers and health care professionals compounding of prescription medications dispensing of controlled and noncontrolled substances counseling of patients transfers of prescriptions advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services security inventory control recordkeeping reporting to boards of pharmacy the united states food and drug administration “fda” the consumer product safety commission the dea and related state agencies and other elements of pharmacy practice pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local state and federal agencies with various powers to investigate inspect audit or solicit information including boards of pharmacy and nursing the dea the fda the united states department of justice the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and others many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers conduct audits on a regular basis can impose substantial fines and penalties and may revoke the license registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional 

  

 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc federal communications commission “fcc” and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions 

  

laws and regulations related to our pharmacy services segment 

  

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole we are subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

  

pbm laws and regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm mail or specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

medicare part d  the medicare part d program which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible medicare beneficiaries through private insurers regulates all aspects of the provision of medicare drug coverage including enrollment formularies pharmacy networks marketing and claims processing the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve cms has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect medicare part d beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for noncompliance 

  

network access legislation  medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers for example certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

  

also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability and the health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment these laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits lastly several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs “mac” for generic prescription drugs mac methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors including cms to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively impact our ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

  

contract audits  we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our pbm network contracts our contracts relating to medicare part d and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with other payors because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

  

 

federal employee health benefits program  we have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the federal employee health benefits “fehb” program such as the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the fehb act and as part of the fehb program these arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of fehb act and other federal regulations such as the fehb acquisition regulation that otherwise are not applicable to us 

  

state insurance laws  pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of pbm activities due to legislation passing in several states requiring pbms to register or obtain a license with the department rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a few states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements pharmacy reimbursement for generics mac reimbursement and pharmacy audits  most of which fall under the state insurance code additionally some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 

  

as a pdp silverscript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency in addition pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

  

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan and with respect to the contraceptive coverage mandate one of the health reforms presently included in aca 

  

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

  

formulary and plan design regulation  a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state exchanges additionally naic and health care accreditation agencies like ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

  

managed care reform  in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

 

  

disease management services regulation  we provide disease management programs to pbm plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industries 

  

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices increased revenue sharing enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one 

 

or more pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive in addition changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees could adversely impact our profitability 

  

our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operations have also been affected by the margin pressures described above including client demands for lower prices generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive a shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our margins including the shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day prescriptions at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions finally the margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements these actions could also adversely affect the margins of our ltc business 

  

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

  

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbms government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are continuing at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices for example we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers including ltc facilities and pharmacies a change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant parts of aca could also impact our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effects will be 

  

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs this change has negatively affected our reimbursement in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

  

a highly competitive business environment 

  

each of our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy retail health clinic and pharmacy services operations currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment 

 

  

the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business as well as our specialty pharmacy operations with noncaremark payors is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks as a pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets online and other discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs convenience stores and mass merchants some of which are aggressively expanding into markets we serve we also face competition from other retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively competition may also come from other sources in the future changes in market dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted networks could materially and adversely impact us 

  

we could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy operations focuses on complex and highcost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories 

  

the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operations is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations in the geographic regions we serve we compete with pharmerica our largest competitor as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by longterm care facilities and local retail pharmacies our longterm care customers consist of skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent living communities hospitals correctional facilities and other health care service providers we believe that the assisted living segment where residents can choose which pharmacy will provide them with pharmaceuticals is projected to grow the most as a percentage of the total ltc sector over the near term the ability of a resident of an assisted living facility to select the pharmacy that supplies him or her with pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations because there can be no assurance that such resident will select us 

  

the competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts optumrx prime therapeutics medimpact and humana include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other sources in the future in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

  

competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer strong competition in the pbm marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

  

changes in us policy laws and regulations including reform of the united states health care system 

  

the results of the november 2016 elections continue to generate some uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of executive orders specific proposals discussed by the presidential administration could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations include but are not limited to immigration policies the modification of aca other significant changes to health care system legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries are also possible 

  

 

potential modification to aca significant changes to medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the health insurance marketplaces could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further changes to aca are possible and we cannot predict the effect if any on future changes to aca the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy specialty pharmacy and pharmacy services operations 

  

in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material impact on our business liquidity and results of operations in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade regulations could adversely affect our business 

  

risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework 

  

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business  government regulation” in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels further uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business in addition it is possible that certain provisions of the current health care reform legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties significant fines or monetary penalties suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of registrations or licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards financial disclosure securities laws and regulations federal antitrust laws tax laws and regulations and their possible reform laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and laws and regulations of the ftc the fcc and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell such as boards of pharmacy the fda dea and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states’ controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations in addition our business interests outside of the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations we are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates including those described in the government regulation section in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative regulatory action and enforcement activity including without limitation any one or more of the following 

  









 







































  

the possibility of client losses andor the failure to win new business 

  

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract our clients are generally well informed and organized can move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could negatively affect our business these factors together with the impact of competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to attract new clients retain existing clients and crosssell additional services further the pbm industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business with respect to our ltc business reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities the termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

 

  

additionally with respect to our retail and ltc pharmacy businesses reimbursement under medicare part d as well as reimbursement from certain private thirdparty payors is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives the loss of those agreements or a material change in the terms of those agreements could negatively impact the company in addition restricted networks that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacies negatively impact those businesses 

  

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

  

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mailorder pharmacies and through our pbm’s network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced 

  

additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

  

further we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers our agreements with these suppliers are often shortterm and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in some cases we depend upon a single source of supply 

  

in addition our suppliers are independent entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control if our current suppliers were to stop selling prescription drugs to us or delay delivery including as a result of supply shortages supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcies of our suppliers or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

  

a disruption in our business operations could occur as a result of contamination of drugs a failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage conditions errors in mail order processing the unavailability of prescription drugs provided by suppliers labor disruptions or other unanticipated disruptions at our mail order facilities call centers data centers or corporate facilities among other factors such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our customers 

  

in the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

  

the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products as the sale of generic alternatives normally yield higher gross margins than brand name equivalents in addition inflation in the price of the brand name drugs can affect utilization particularly given the increase in high deductible health plans accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives as well as the pricing of brand name drugs 

  

 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

  

our business is affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general including various economic factors inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns it is possible that an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause a decline in drug and health care services utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms these changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results this could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments 

  

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of   sensitive customer and business information 

  

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing extracare customer loyalty program finance human resource and other processes throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches coordinated cyber attacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities including ones from a cyber security standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

  

if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

failure to adequately protect receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals 

  

many aspects of our business involve the collection transmission and use of an individual’s protected health information or other sensitive personal information in some cases we also use aggregated and deidentified data as defined by hipaa for analytical and research purposes particularly data related to improving the quality of the care we provide in other cases we may provide deidentified data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and to thirdparty data aggregators where permitted by our contracts these activities are subject to federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations and in the future may be subject to international regulatory requirements such as the general data protection regulation a new european union privacy regulation that takes effect on may 25 2018 at the federal level hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health 

 

information by all participants in the health care industry whether directly as a covered entity or as a business associate our business encompasses both situations and includes our pharmacists nurse practitioners and pbm operations in addition industry requirements such as generally accepted privacy principles may be imposed on us by our contracts with our pbm clients or other customers many of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is a security standard mandated by the credit card industry for the purpose of protecting credit card account data these increasingly complex laws regulations and industry requirements are subject to change and compliance with them may result in significant expenses associated with increased operational and compliance costs particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of information to the extent that either we or our vendors with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm for example the privacy and security of the information we maintain may be compromised by the actions of outside parties by employee errors or by malfeasance such risks may result in an unauthorized party obtaining access to our data systems thereby threatening the privacy of protected health information or other sensitive personal information we use and maintain failure to comply with federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions in addition failure to comply with our own privacy or security policies may result in sanctions by the ftc or other federal oversight agencies future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient member or customer identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business furthermore if we violate a patient’s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of phi we could be liable for significant damages fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

  

medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if the government mandates the use of pointofsale manufacturer rebates or makes changes to how pharmacy payforperformance is calculated if congress acts to reduce reinsurance thresholds from 80 to 20 if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be negatively impacted 

  

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally 

  

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price “awp” or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs “ffs medicaid” have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

  

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage 

  

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services including propriety brands 

  

the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in our markets an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

  

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty 

  

finally our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients as a result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

risks related to developing and maintaining a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers 

  

our business has evolved from a retail store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining mobile commerce 

 

applications for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

  

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

  

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these companies are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

solvency of our customers 

  

in the event that our customers operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing our customers may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition both state and federal government sponsored payers as a result of budget deficits or reductions may suspend payments or seek to reduce their healthcare expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating their contracts with us any delay or reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

  

our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may negatively impact our ability to make important investments in our business and limit our flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions in addition our debt levels and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes in the future these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

  

further we may incur and assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with the aetna acquisition or other acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures for example in connection with the aetna acquisition if it is completed we expect to incur approximately 450 billion of new indebtedness and assume approximately 82 billion of existing indebtedness of aetna if we do not retire our existing debt or debt we assume in acquisitions or other strategic transactions the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing indebtedness when it expires and by any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

  

we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital markets for any reason whether due to market conditions or otherwise our continued access to the capital markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance the amount of our 

 

indebtedness and debt service obligations and our credit ratings any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

  

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to secure indebtedness with a security interest on certain property or stock or engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain properties in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed specified levels our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and if we fail to comply with such restrictions or covenants our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

  

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us 

  

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company may also be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

  











  

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation furthermore these acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or geographic markets and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

  

risks related to the seasonality of our business 

  

although the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well this could lead to lost sales as well as increased snow removal and other costs thereby negatively affecting our shortterm results of operations in addition both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year and our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership see “business  pharmacy services seasonality” 

  

our operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and results 

  

we are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks including natural disasters utility and other mechanical failures acts of war or terrorism disruption of communications data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulties the occurrence of any of these or other events might disrupt or shut down operations or otherwise adversely impact our operations we may also be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such events although we have developed business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and 

 

industry our insurance policies include limits and as such our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business should any such hazards or risks occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

  

pharmacy services retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries we are currently subject to various litigation matters investigations audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and legal proceedings litigation and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation is often expensive and disruptive further under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state health care programs including medicare and medicaid litigation related to our provision of professional services in our pharmacies specialty pharmacies clinics and ltc facilities has also increased as we expand our services along the continuum of health care we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be required to materially change our business practices as a result of such proceedings we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

  

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 

  

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or an unexpected loss of leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets could in the future become impaired 

  

as of december 31 2017 we had 521 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelylived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we first compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a comparable market multiple model if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the foregoing is not a comprehensive listing of all possible risks and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business as such we refer you to “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes our “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” at the end of such section of our annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2017 which section is incorporated by reference herein 

  

 

aetnarelated risk factors in addition to the risk factors described above that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects the following risk factors and additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially adversely affect us and the aetna acquisition 

  

in order to complete the merger we and aetna must obtain certain governmental authorizations and if such authorizations are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties completion of the merger may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced 

  

completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the hsr act and certain other applicable laws or regulations and the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect although we and aetna have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts subject to certain limitations to make certain governmental filings or obtain the governmental authorizations required to complete the merger the “required governmental authorizations” as the case may be there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained and no assurance that the merger will be completed 

  

in addition the governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the merger including other potential transactions in the health care industry or other industries these governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent or otherwise seek to prevent the merger as a condition to authorization of the merger or related transactions these governmental authorities also may impose requirements limitations or costs require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger under the terms of the merger agreement we are not required and aetna is not permitted without our consent to take any actions or agree to any terms or conditions in connection with i the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the hsr act ii any other antitrust law or iii the required governmental authorizations in each case if such action term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have individually or in the aggregate a regulatory material adverse effect on us or aetna 

  

however notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement either we or aetna could become subject to terms or conditions in connection with such waiting periods laws or other authorizations whether because such term or condition does not rise to the specified level of materiality or we otherwise consent to its imposition the imposition of which could adversely affect our ability to integrate aetna’s operations with our operations reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations after completion of the merger 

  

in addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations completion of the merger is subject to a number of other conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the merger will not be completed 

  

our obligations and the obligations of aetna to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions in addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations including among other conditions i approval and adoption of the merger agreement by aetna shareholders at an aetna special meeting ii approval of the stock issuance by our stockholders at the cvs health special meeting iii approval for the listing on the new york stock exchange of the shares of cvs health common stock to be issued in the merger iv absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the transaction v accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party subject to certain materiality qualifications vi performance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the transaction and vii the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party there can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed 

  

in addition the cvs health special meeting and the aetna special meeting may take place before certain governmental authorizations have been obtained and therefore before the terms on which such governmental authorizations may be obtained or the conditions to obtaining such governmental authorizations that may be imposed are known as a result if cvs health stockholders approve the stock issuance at the cvs health special meeting or aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement at the aetna special meeting we and aetna may make decisions after the respective meetings to waive a condition as to the receipt of certain governmental authorizations or to take certain 

 

actions required to obtain such governmental authorizations without seeking further stockholder or shareholder approval as applicable and such actions could have an adverse effect on the combined company 

  

after completion of the merger we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock 

  

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of cvs health and aetna our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including 

  











  

if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of cvs health and aetna within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of our common stock may be adversely affected 

  

we and aetna have operated and until completion of the merger will continue to operate independently and there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key cvs health or aetna employees the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of aetna and cvs health in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined business performs as expected include among other things 

  



























  

in addition at times the attention of certain members of each company’s management and each company’s resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company 

  

we have limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry which may hinder our ability to achieve the combined company’s objectives 

  

we have limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business and will rely in large part on the existing management of aetna to continue to manage the aetna business following the merger however there is no 

 

assurance that we will be able to retain the services of such management if we fail to retain the existing management of aetna our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction may be adversely affected 

  

we and aetna may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger 

  

as we will be operating in industry sectors for which our existing management team has little or no experience our success after the transaction will depend in part on our ability to retain key executives and other employees of aetna uncertainty about the effect of the merger on cvs health and aetna employees may have an adverse effect on each of us and aetna separately and consequently the combined business this uncertainty may impair our andor aetna’s ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger as employees of cvs health and aetna may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business 

  

additionally aetna’s officers and employees may hold aetna common shares as well as aetna stock appreciation rights aetna restricted stock units “aetna rsus” and aetna performance stock units “aetna psus” that are subject to accelerated vesting on a change in control and if the merger is completed these officers and employees may be entitled to cash andor the consideration payable under the merger agreement in respect of such aetna common shares stock appreciation rights aetna rsus and aetna psus these payouts could also make retention of these officers and employees more difficult additionally pursuant to employment agreements andor other agreements or arrangements with aetna certain key employees of aetna are entitled to receive severance payments upon a termination without cause andor a resignation for “good reason” following completion of the merger under these agreements certain key employees of aetna potentially could resign from his or her employment following specified circumstances set forth in his or her applicable agreement including an adverse change in his or her title authority or responsibilities compensation and benefits or primary office location 

  

furthermore if key employees of cvs health or aetna depart or are at risk of departing including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business we may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of aetna and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be materially and adversely affected accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees of aetna to the same extent that aetna has been able to attract or retain employees in the past 

  

our and aetna’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger 

  

parties with which we or aetna do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to current or future business relationships with us aetna or the combined business our and aetna’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers providers vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us aetna or the combined business these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of cvs health aetna andor the combined business including a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger the risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

  

the merger agreement contains provisions that may make it more difficult for us and aetna to pursue alternatives to the merger 

  

the merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for aetna to sell its business to a party other than us or for us to sell its business these provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal further there are only limited exceptions to each party’s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement in the case of aetna or the approval of the stock issuance in our case and the other party generally has a right to match any acquisition proposal that may be made however at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by aetna shareholders in the case of aetna or the approval of the stock issuance by cvs health stockholders in our case such party’s board of directors is permitted to take certain of 

 

these actions if it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law 

  

while we believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers these restrictions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either aetna or cvs health from considering or proposing that acquisition even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher pershare value than the currently proposed merger consideration in the case of aetna or that party were prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to us or our stockholders in our case furthermore the termination fees described below may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower pershare price to acquire the applicable party than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by such party in certain circumstances 

  

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

  

if the merger is not completed for any reason including as a result of aetna shareholders failing to approve and adopt the merger agreement or cvs health stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger we would be subject to a number of risks including the following 

  











  

there can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize if any of those risks materialize they may materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition financial results ratings stock prices andor bond prices 

  

in addition we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our obligation to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if the merger is not completed these risks may materialize and may materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition financial results ratings stock prices andor bond prices 

  

we and aetna may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the merger from being completed 

  

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements even if the lawsuits are without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources an adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on our and aetna’s respective liquidity and financial condition additionally if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed which may adversely affect our and aetna’s respective business financial position and results of operation since the filing with the sec of the preliminary joint proxy statementprospectus relating to the proposed merger a number of class action lawsuits in connection with the merger have been filed against us aetna and aetna’s 

 

directors and officers neither we nor aetna presently believe that there is any merit to any such lawsuit we and aetna intend to defend them vigorously 

  

our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of cvs health and aetna existing prior to the announcement of the transaction this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and operating results 

  

in order to complete the merger we expect to incur acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 450 billion and assume aetna’s existing indebtedness of approximately 82 billion our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that of cvs health prior to the merger will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the indebtedness of cvs health or aetna individually prior to the merger the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available to fund our efforts to combine our business with aetna and realize expected benefits of the merger andor engage in investments in product development capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

  

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and as a result our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or following completion of the merger obligations to the combined company’s insureds each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future following the announcement of the merger agreement each of standard  poor’s and moody’s placed certain of our debt financial strength and other credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade following the announcement of the merger agreement standard  poor’s am best and fitch placed aetna’s debt financial strength and other credit ratings under review with negative implications downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and operating results in addition if the merger is completed and in certain circumstances aetna’s debt securities are rated below investment grade this may constitute a change of control triggering event under the indentures governing such debt upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event aetna as the surviving corporation of the merger would be required to offer to repurchase most of aetna’s outstanding notes at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the date of repurchase however it is possible that aetna or us would not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in other debt instruments would not allow such repurchases we cannot provide any assurance that there will be sufficient funds available for aetna or us to make any required repurchases of the notes upon a change of control triggering event 

  

we will incur significant transaction and integrationrelated costs in connection with the merger 

  

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies we will incur significant transaction costs related to the merger including with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid to aetna shareholders we also will incur significant integrationrelated fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

  

 

the merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

  

we currently project that the merger will result in a number of benefits including enhanced competitive positioning and a platform from which to accelerate growth and that it will be accretive to earnings per share in the second full year after the close of the transaction this projection is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change in addition future events and conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integrationrelated costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger any dilution of decrease in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

  

the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following completion of the merger 

  

following completion of the merger the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either our or aetna’s respective businesses the combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and its ability to manage a combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger

retail pharmacy network   management   we maintain a national network of more than 68000  retail pharmacies consisting of approximately 41000  chain pharmacies which includes our cvs pharmacy locations and 27000  independent pharmacies in the united states puerto rico district of columbia guam and the virgin islands when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription we are also able to build clientspecific networks and narrow networks to further drive savings for our clients 

  

prescription management systems   we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail order or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies described above all prescriptions processed through our systems whether they are filled through one of our mail order or specialty dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems provide essential features and functionality to allow a plan member to use their prescription drug benefit these systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists by enhancing review of various items through automation including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

  

clinical services   we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote good health outcomes and to help target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management quality assurance adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies 

  

disease management programs   our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties our accordant ® programs include integrated rare disease management programs which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis parkinson’s disease seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance “ncqa” a private notforprofit organization that evaluates accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations they have also been awarded case management accreditation from urac 

medical pharmacy management   we offer a technology platform novologix ®  an online preauthorization tool that helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs and helps to ensure appropriate clinical use of these drugs 

  

pharmacy services information systems   we currently operate and support a small number of claim adjudication platforms to support our pharmacy services segment however the majority of our clients have migrated to one platform these information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to our pbm clients our health engagement engine tm   technology and proprietary clinical algorithms help enable our mail and specialty pharmacists provide quality care and our 

enterprise digital strategy and integrated digital offerings help patients seamlessly manage mail specialty and retail prescriptions 

  

pharmacy services clients   our clients are primarily employers insurance companies unions government employee groups health plans medicare part d plans managed medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems among other things to help perform safety checks drug interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients in 2016 net revenues from aetna accounted for approximately 112 of our consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 2014 no single pbm client accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues 

pharmacy services seasonality   the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature however our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a members cumulative annual outofpocket costs the benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year as a result the pdp plan pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses 

pharmacy services competition   we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers as well as to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks ii the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies including the development and utilization of preferred formularies iii the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients and be responsive to clients’ needs and the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members as well as operational excellence in delivering services the pharmacy services segment has a significant number of competitors offering pbm services including large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms eg express scripts optumrx humana prime therapeutics and medimpact

retail pharmacy business strategy   our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and 

recommending more cost effective drug therapies we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we are leveraging digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime anywhere we are introducing digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives in 2016 we rolled out cvs pay tm nationwide an endtoend mobile payment solution that integrates payment prescription pickup and our extracare ®  loyalty program into one spot at checkout we believe that continuing to innovate with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

  

retailltc products and services   a typical retail store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics personal care products convenience foods photo finishing services seasonal merchandise and greeting cards the pharmacies within target stores sell prescription drugs and overthecounter drugs that are required to be held behind the counter the ltc operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals and related consulting and ancillary services we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business our clinics offer a variety of health care services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants 

retailltc net revenues by major product group are as follows 



   

pharmacy   pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2016 2015 and 2014 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to industry demographics eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the introduction of new pharmaceutical products and medicare part d we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans pbms and providers given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology and ready when promised consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program maintenance choice ®  a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order pharmacy advisor ®  our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions specialty connect ®  our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities providing members with diseasestate specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a cvs pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies as well as scriptsync ®  a service that enables patients with multiple medications to pick up their eligible maintenance prescriptions in a single monthly cvs pharmacy visit  maintenance choice pharmacy advisor specialty connect and scriptsync are all programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies rxconnect our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review our prescription refill program readyfill ®  and our online retail businesses cvscom navarrocom and onofrecombr in december 2015 we expanded our pharmacy offering with the 

acquisition of the pharmacies within target stores now that the system integration is complete we will offer all the same pharmacy services available in our retail drugstores and online at our pharmacies within target stores 

  

front store   front store revenues benefited from our strategy to innovate with new and unique products and services using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits we continue to launch and enhance new and exclusive brands to create unmatched offerings in beauty another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs pharmacy ® and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvs pharmacy stores we currently carry approximately 7000 cvs pharmacy and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 226 of our front store revenues during 2016 these products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins furthermore we are tailoring certain groups of stores such as suburban area stores to better meet the needs of our customers this includes the launch of cvs curbside in late 2016 developed in partnership with industry leader curbside customers can use the cvs pharmacy app to have front store purchases delivered to their car when they pull up to our store

retail pharmacy drugstore development   the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a key role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites during 2016 we opened 130 new and acquired retail stores relocated 50 stores and closed 46 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1100 new and relocated stores and acquired 1841 stores including the pharmacies acquired from target we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers

retailltc customers   the success of our retail drugstore and longterm care businesses is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers and other payors on acceptable terms pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs commercial employers and other third party payors accounted for 989 of our 2016 pharmacy revenues no single retailltc payor accounts for 10 or more of our annual consolidated net revenues 

  

retailltc seasonality   the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however retail front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season in addition both pharmacy and retail front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season for additional information we refer you to “risks related to the seasonality of our business” in item 1a risk factors 

  

retailltc competition   the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in the markets we serve we compete with other drugstore chains eg walgreens and rite aid supermarkets discount retailers eg walmart independent pharmacies restrictive pharmacy networks membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics including urgent care centers as well as other mail order pharmacies 

ltc pharmaceutical services are highly regional or local in nature and within a given geographic area of operation highly competitive our largest competitor nationally is pharmerica we also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by longterm care facilities and local retail pharmacies some states have enacted “freedom of choice” or “any willing provider” requirements as part of their state medicaid programs or in separate legislation which may increase the competition that we face in providing services to longterm care facility residents in these states

government regulation 

  

overview   much of our business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations in addition many of our pbm clients and our payors in the retailltc segment including insurers medicare part d plans managed medicaid plans and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor similarly our ltc clients such as skilled nursing facilities are subject to government regulations including many of the same government regulations to which we are subject the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty further there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted we are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations as summarized below or any adverse applications of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results andor financial condition see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

although we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our various business lines we cannot give any assurances that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business the pharmacy services retail pharmacy longterm care or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services retail pharmacy longterm care or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam  lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam  lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services retail pharmacy longterm care or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally 

laws and regulations related to each operating segment of our business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs   we are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties multiples damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act “fca” the federal antikickback statute various state false claims acts and antikickback statutes the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the fca prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs as part of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “aca” the federal antikickback statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the fca where it results from a 

violation of the antikickback statute most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the fca and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam  or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government further the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

the 21st century cures act “cures act” enacted in december 2016 among other things shifted payment for medicare part b durable medical equipment “dme” infused drugs from one pricing benchmark to another as of january 1 2017 this change depending upon the particular drug is expected to cause both increases and decreases in reimbursement although the overall impact is expected to be negative in addition the change in presidential administration has caused uncertainty regarding the implementation of the cures act meaning that the full impact of this new law on the company is uncertain 

antiremuneration laws   federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs 

  

antitrust and unfair competition   the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvs pharmacy or cvs specialty plays a unique or expanded role in a pbm product offering our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements   many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit   credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi it also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

  

finally the health insurance marketplaces formerly known as the “exchanges” are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the health insurance marketplace has implemented for itself or nonhealth insurance marketplace entities which include insurers offering plans through the health insurance marketplaces and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws   the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the ftca the federal postal service act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws these laws have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing 

of loyalty programs and health care services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected 

government agreements and mandates   the company andor its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees settlement agreements corrective action plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices controlled substances medicare part d prescription drug plans expired products environmental and safety matters marketing and advertising practices pbm long term care and pharmacy operations and various other business practices these agreements may contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company failure to meet the company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies financial penalties administrative remedies andor exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 

environmental and safety regulation   our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment public health and employee safety including for example regulations governing the management of hazardous substances the cleaning up of contaminated sites and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores distribution centers and other facilities governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

health reform legislation   passed in 2010 aca affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients as a result these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices some significant aca provisions are still being finalized eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage and all or parts of aca may be repealed or replaced so the full impact of aca on our company is still uncertain 

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation   we are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs operation of retail specialty infusion ltc and mail order pharmacies licensure of facilities and professionals including pharmacists technicians and nurses registration of facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances packaging storing shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals repackaging of drug products labeling medication guides and other consumer disclosures interactions with prescribers and health care professionals compounding of prescription medications dispensing of controlled and noncontrolled substances counseling of patients transfers of prescriptions advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services security inventory control recordkeeping reporting to boards of pharmacy the united states food and drug administration “fda” the consumer product safety commission the dea and related state agencies and other elements of pharmacy practice pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local state and federal agencies with various powers to investigate inspect audit or solicit information including boards of pharmacy and nursing the dea the fda the united states department of justice the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and others many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers conduct audits on a regular basis can impose substantial fines and penalties and may revoke the license registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts   certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc federal communications commission “fcc” and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions 

laws and regulations related to our pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole we are subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation   legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm mail or specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

medicare part d   the medicare part d program which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible medicare beneficiaries through private insurers regulates all aspects of the provision of medicare drug coverage including enrollment formularies pharmacy networks marketing and claims processing the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve cms has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect medicare part d beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for noncompliance 

network access legislation   medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers for example certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability and the health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment these laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits lastly several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs “mac” for generic prescription drugs mac methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors including cms to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively impact our ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

contract audits   we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our pbm network contracts our contracts relating to medicare part d and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with other payors because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

federal employee health benefits program   we have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the federal employee health benefits program such as the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the federal employees health benefits act “fehba” and as part of the federal employees health benefits program these arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of fehba and other federal regulations such as the federal employees health benefits acquisition regulation that otherwise are not applicable to us 

state insurance laws   pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however state 

departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of pbm activities due to legislation passing in several states requiring pbms to register or obtain a license with the department rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a few states with the areas of focus on licensure requirements pharmacy reimbursement for generics mac reimbursement and pharmacy audits  most of which fall under the state insurance code additionally some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 

as a pdp silverscript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency in addition pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

erisa regulation   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan and with respect to the contraceptive coverage mandate one of the health reforms presently included in aca 

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

formulary and plan design regulation   a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state exchanges additionally naic and health care accreditation agencies like ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

managed care reform   in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

disease management services regulation   we provide disease management programs to pbm plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws   many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs 

laws and regulations related to our retailltc segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole we are subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our retailltc segment specifically among these are the following 

specific fda regulation   the fda generally has authority to among other things regulate the manufacture distribution sale and labeling of many products sold through retail pharmacies including prescription drugs overthecounter medications medical devices including mobile medical devices cosmetics dietary supplements and certain food items 

  

retail clinics   states regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industries 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices increased revenue sharing enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive in addition changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to use mac lists and collect transmission fees could adversely impact our profitability 

our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operations have also been affected by the margin pressures described above including client demands for lower prices generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive a shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our margins including the shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day prescriptions at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions 

finally the margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements these actions could also adversely affect the margins of our ltc business 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbms government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are continuing at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices for example we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers including ltc facilities and pharmacies a change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant parts of aca could also impact our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effects will be 

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs this change has negatively affected our reimbursement in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

a highly competitive business environment 

each of our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy retail health clinic and pharmacy services operations currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment 

the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business as well as our specialty pharmacy operations with noncaremark payors is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks as a pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets online and other discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs convenience stores and mass merchants some of which are aggressively expanding into markets we serve we also face competition from other retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms competition may also come from other sources in the future changes in market dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted networks could materially and adversely impact us 

we could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy operations focuses on complex and highcost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories 

the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operations is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations in the geographic regions we serve we compete with pharmerica corporation our largest 

competitor as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by ltc facilities and local retail pharmacies 

the competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts optumrx prime therapeutics medimpact and humana include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other sources in the future in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer strong competition in the pbm marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

changes in us policy laws and regulations including reform of the united states health care system 

the results of the november 2016 elections have generated uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take including through the use of executive orders specific proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations include but are not limited to immigration policies the repeal of all or part of aca and other significant changes to health care system legislation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries 

the repeal of all or part of the aca significant changes to medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the health insurance marketplaces could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage even if aca remains significant provisions of aca have not yet been finalized eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized we cannot predict the effect if any a repeal of all or part of aca the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of aca or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and pharmacy services operations 

in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacies and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united states in most cases the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us as a result significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to suppliers depress economic activity and have a material impact on our business liquidity and results of operations in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes as well as any negative sentiments towards the united states in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade regulations could adversely affect our business 

finally comprehensive tax reform is likely to be considered in the current political environment we expect that tax reform if enacted could have a significant impact on the company current proposals aim to lower the us corporate tax rate from 35 to as low as 15 or 20 but generally broaden the base to which the lower tax rate would apply many aspects of tax reform plans remain unknown though and no proposed legislation has been filed we cannot say with certainty if tax reform will be enacted or how it would impact the company 

risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework   

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business  government regulation” in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels further uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business in addition it is possible that all or certain provision of the current health care reform legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to 

implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties significant fines or monetary penalties suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of registrations or licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards financial disclosure securities laws and regulations federal antitrust laws tax laws and regulations and their possible reform laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and laws and regulations of the ftc the fcc and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell such as boards of pharmacy the fda dea and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states’ controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations in addition our business interests outside of the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations we are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates including those described in the government regulation section in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative regulatory action and enforcement activity including without limitation any one or more of the following 



 

the possibility of client losses andor the failure to win new business 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract our clients are generally well informed and organized can easily move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could negatively affect our business these factors together with the impact of competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to attract new clients retain existing clients and crosssell additional services further the pbm industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business with respect to our ltc business reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities the termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

additionally with respect to our retail and ltc pharmacy businesses reimbursement under medicare part d as well as reimbursement from certain private thirdparty payors is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives the loss of those agreements or a material change in the terms of those agreements could negatively impact the company in addition restricted networks that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacies negatively impact those businesses 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products as the sale of generic alternatives normally yield higher gross margins than brand name equivalents in addition inflation in the price of the brand name drugs can affect utilization particularly given the increase in high deductible health plans accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives as well as the pricing of brand name drugs 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

our business is affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general including various economic factors inflation and changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns it is possible that an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause a decline in drug and health care services utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms these changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results this could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health plan designs favoring coinsurance over copayments 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of   sensitive customer and business information 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing extracare customer loyalty program finance human resource and other processes throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches coordinated cyber attacks vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities including ones from a cyber security standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payors and vendors 

if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail ltc specialty and mailorder pharmacies and through our pbm’s network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced 

additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

further we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers our agreements with these suppliers are often shortterm and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages 

a disruption in our business operations could occur as a result of contamination of drugs a failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage conditions errors in mail order processing the unavailability of prescription drugs provided by suppliers labor disruptions or other unanticipated disruptions at our mail order facilities call centers data centers or corporate facilities among other factors such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our customers 

in the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if congress acts to reduce reinsurance thresholds from 80 to 20 if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be negatively impacted 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price “awp” or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs “ffs medicaid” are expected to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost “aac” by april 1 2017 this move to an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies a failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services including propriety brands 

the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores and online sites and to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in our markets an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the 

failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty 

moreover customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to engage with our retail customers not only facetoface in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media our customers are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation if we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected 

finally our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients as a result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards mobile payments and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these companies are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets as well as internal controls into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company may also be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 



 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation furthermore these acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or geographic markets and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could among other things limit our ability to make incremental investments in our business 

our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may dampen incremental investments in our business and limit our   flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions in addition our debt level and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any required future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes moreover we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital markets for any reason whether due to market conditions or otherwise these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to the seasonality of our business 

although the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well this could lead to lost sales as well as increased snow removal and other costs thereby negatively affecting our shortterm results of operations in addition both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year and our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership see “business  pharmacy services seasonality” 

risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

pharmacy services retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries we are currently subject to various litigation matters investigations audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and legal proceedings litigation and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation is often expensive and disruptive further under the qui tam  or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state health care programs including medicare and medicaid litigation related to our provision of professional services in our pharmacies specialty pharmacies clinics and ltc facilities has also increased as we expand our services along the continuum of health care we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be required to materially change our business practices as a result of such proceedings we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information

retail pharmacy network   management   we maintain a national network of more than 68000  retail pharmacies consisting of approximately 41000  chain pharmacies which includes our cvs pharmacy stores and 27000  independent pharmacies in the united states puerto rico district of columbia guam and the virgin islands when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

  

prescription management systems   we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail order or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies described above all prescriptions processed through our systems whether they are filled through one of our mail order or specialty dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems provide essential features and functionality to allow a plan member to apply their prescription drug benefit these systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists by automating review of various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

  

clinical services   we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote safety and to help target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management quality assurance adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies 

  

disease management programs   our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties our accordant ® programs include integrated rare disease management programs which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis parkinson’s disease seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance “ncqa” a private notforprofit organization that evaluates accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations they have also been awarded case management accreditation from urac 

medical pharmacy management   we offer a technology platform that helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs and helps to ensure appropriate clinical use of these drugs 

  

pharmacy services information systems   we currently operate and support a small number of claim adjudication platforms to support our pharmacy services segment however the majority of our clients have migrated to one destination platform these information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to our pbm clients 

  

pharmacy services clients   our clients are primarily employers insurance companies unions government employee groups health plans managed medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems among other things to help perform safety checks drug 

interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients no single pbm client accounts for 10 or more of our annual consolidated revenues 

  

pharmacy services seasonality   the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature however our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a members cumulative annual outofpocket costs the benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year as a result the pdp plan pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses 

pharmacy services competition   we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred formularies vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members and ix operational excellence in delivering services the pharmacy services segment has a significant number of competitors offering pbm services including large national pbm companies eg express scripts pbms owned by large national health plans eg optumrx and smaller standalone pbms eg prime therapeutics and medimpact

retail pharmacy business strategy   our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including 

flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and recommending more cost effective drug therapies in addition personalization is central to our retail strategy our customerdriven personalization through extracare ®  extracare beauty club ®  and myweeklyad tm  are designed to help us connect directly with individual consumers to deliver a personalized experience we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we are leveraging digital to empower our customers and patients by making the full breadth of health care and pharmacy services available to them anytime anywhere we are introducing digital tools to make it easier for people to save time and money and to live healthier lives we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction

retailltc net revenues by major product group are as follows 



   

pharmacy   pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2015 2014 and 2013 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the impact of expanded health insurance coverage through the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “aca” the introduction of new pharmaceutical products and medicare part d we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans pbms and providers given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology and ready when promised consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program maintenance choice ®  a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order and pharmacy advisor ®  our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions specialty connect tm  our integrated specialty pharmacy offering which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities providing members with diseasestate specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a cvs pharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies as well as scriptsync™ a new pharmacy service introduced in 2015 that enables patients with multiple medications to pick up their eligible maintenance prescriptions in a single monthly cvs pharmacy visit  maintenance choice pharmacy advisor specialty connect and scriptsync are all programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies 

our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review rxconnect our prescription refill program readyfill ®  and our online retail businesses cvscom navarrocom and onofrecombr in december 2015 we expanded our pharmacy offering with the acquisition of the pharmacies within target stores once the system integration is complete we will offer all the same pharmacy services offered in our retail drugstores and online at our pharmacies within target stores 

  

front store   front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits similar to extracare is the beauty club another program that rewards our loyal customers with sales prices and customized coupons we continue to launch and enhance new and exclusive brands like nuance salma hayek tm  makeup academy tm  and nyx ®  to create unmatched offerings in beauty another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs pharmacy ® and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvs pharmacy stores we currently carry over 6400 cvs pharmacy and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 213 of our front store revenues during 2015 these products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins furthermore we are tailoring certain groups of stores such as suburban area stores to better meet the needs of our customers

onsite pharmacies   we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites typically under the careplus ®  careplus cvs pharmacy tm  or cvs pharmacy ® name which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

  

retail pharmacy drugstore development   the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a key role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites during 2015 we opened 161 new retail pharmacy stores acquired 1672 pharmacies within target stores and 14 other locations relocated 58 stores and closed 31 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1100 new and relocated stores and acquired 1832 stores including the pharmacies acquired from target we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers

retailltc customers   managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 988 of our 2015 pharmacy revenues the loss of any one payor would not have a material effect on our business no single retailltc payor accounts for 10 or more of our annual consolidated revenues however the success of our retail drugstore and longterm care businesses is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms 

  

retailltc seasonality   the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however retail front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season in addition both pharmacy and retail front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season for additional information we refer you to “risks related to the seasonality of our business” in item 1a risk factors 

  

retailltc competition   the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in the markets we serve we compete with other drugstore chains eg walgreens and rite aid supermarkets discount retailers eg walmart independent pharmacies restrictive pharmacy networks membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms ltc pharmaceutical services are highly regional or local in nature and within a given geographic area of operation highly competitive our largest competitor nationally is pharmerica we also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by longterm care facilities and local retail pharmacies some states have enacted “freedom of choice” or “any willing provider” requirements as part of their state medicaid programs or in separate legislation which may increase the competition that we face in providing services to longterm care facility residents in these states

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi it also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

  

finally the health insurance marketplaces formerly known as the “exchanges” are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the health insurance marketplace has implemented for itself or nonhealth insurance marketplace entities which include insurers offering plans through the health insurance marketplaces and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws   the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the ftca the federal postal service act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws these laws have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected 

government agreements and mandates   the company andor its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees settlement agreements and corporate integrity agreements with various federal state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices pseudoephedrine products medicare part d prescription drug plans expired products environmental and safety matters marketing and advertising practices pbm and pharmacy operations and various other business practices these agreements contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company failure to meet the company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies financial penalties administrative remedies andor exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 

environmental and safety regulation   our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment public health and employee safety including for example regulations governing the management of hazardous substances the cleaning up of contaminated sites and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores distribution centers and other facilities governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail and healthcare sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

health reform legislation   passed in 2010 aca affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients as a result these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices some significant aca provisions are still being finalized eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage so the full impact of aca on our company is still uncertain 

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation   we are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs operation of retail specialty infusion ltc and mail order pharmacies licensure of facilities and professionals including pharmacists technicians and nurses registration of facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances packaging storing shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals repackaging of drug products labeling medication guides and other consumer disclosures interactions with prescribers and healthcare professionals compounding of prescription medications dispensing of controlled and noncontrolled substances counseling of patients transfers of prescriptions advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services security inventory control recordkeeping reporting to boards of pharmacy the united states food and drug administration “fda” the consumer product safety commission the dea and related state agencies and other elements of pharmacy practice pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local state and federal agencies with various powers to investigate inspect audit or solicit information including boards of pharmacy and nursing the dea the fda the united states department of justice the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and others many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers conduct audits on a regular basis can impose substantial fines and penalties and may revoke the license registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts   certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc federal communications commission “fcc” and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions 

laws and regulations related to our pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole we are subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation   legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as the ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

medicare part d   the medicare part d program which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible medicare beneficiaries through private insurers regulates all aspects of the provision of medicare drug coverage including enrollment formularies pharmacy networks marketing and claims processing the medicare part d program has undergone significant 

legislative and regulatory changes since its inception and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve cms has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect medicare part d beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for noncompliance 

network access legislation   medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability and the health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment these laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits lastly several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs “mac” mac methodology is a common cost management practice used to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs including private and public payors mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively impact our ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

contract audits   we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our contracts relating to medicare part d and the agreements our pharmacies enter into with payors because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

federal employee health benefits program   we have a contractual arrangement with carriers for the federal employee health benefits program fehbp such as the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the federal employees health benefits act “fehba” and as part of the federal employees health benefits program these arrangements subjects us to certain aspects of fehba and other federal regulations such as the federal employees health benefits acquisition regulation that otherwise are not applicable to us 

state insurance laws   pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however as a pdp silverscript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency in addition pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepting material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits may be subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

  

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application 

erisa regulation   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan and with respect to the contraceptive coverage mandate one of the health reforms included in aca 

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

formulary and plan design regulation   a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state exchanges additionally the naic and health care accreditation agencies like the ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

managed care reform   in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

disease management services regulation   we provide disease management programs to pbm plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws   many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs 

laws and regulations related to our retailltc segment

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industries 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive in addition changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to collect transmission fees could adversely impact our profitability 

both our retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy businesses have also been affected by the margin pressures described above including client demands for lower prices generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive finally the margins of our ltc business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangements these actions could also adversely affect the margins of our ltc business 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbms government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail ltc and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are continuing at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices for example we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems payment methodologies and operational requirements for health care providers including ltc facilities and pharmacies a change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability 

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement 

formula for multisource ie generic drugs this change will affect our reimbursement in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

a highly competitive business environment 

each of our retail pharmacy business ltc pharmacy business retail health clinic business and pharmacy services business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment 

the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms as a pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets online and other discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies convenience stores and mass merchants many of which are expanding into markets we serve we also face competition from other retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms competition may also come from other sources in the future 

the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy business is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operations in the geographic regions we serve we compete with pharmerica corporation our largest competitor as well as with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies pharmacies owned by ltc facilities and local retail pharmacies 

the competitive success of our pharmacy services business is impacted by its ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts optumrx catamaran prime therapeutics medimpact and humana include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other sources in the future in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

competitors in each of our business areas may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive 

risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework   

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business  government regulation” in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of registrations or licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards securities laws and regulations tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and laws and regulations of the ftc the fcc and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell such as boards of pharmacy the fda dea and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations in addition our business interests outside of the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations we are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates including those described in the government regulation section in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new 

government legislative regulatory action and enforcement activity including without limitation any one or more of the following 

 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause a decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms these changes in conditions could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

the possibility of client losses andor the failure to win new business 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base further the pbm industry has been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and 

retaining or renewing our existing pbm business there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

additionally with respect to our ltc pharmacy business reimbursement under medicare part d as well as reimbursement from certain private thirdparty payors is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives likewise reimbursement from skilled nursing facilities for prescriptions we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreements with those skilled nursing facilities the termination of these agreements generally causes our ability to provide services to any of the residents of that facility to cease resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of   sensitive customer and business information 

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing extracare customer loyalty program finance human resource and other processes throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card information breaches vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities including ones from a cybersecurity standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties 

if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail ltc and mailorder pharmacies and through our pbm’s network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced 

additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

further we acquire a substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacies’ prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers our agreements with these suppliers are often shortterm and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreements may limit our ability to provide services for competing drugs during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than ours certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels a termination or modification to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover many products distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages in the event any products we distribute are in limited supply for significant periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and puts pressure on pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be negatively impacted 

reform of the united states health care system 

congressional efforts to reform the united states health care system came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of aca which resulted in significant structural changes to the health insurance system see “business  government regulation” 

although many of the changes enacted by aca have been implemented some significant provisions have not yet been finalized eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage therefore uncertainty remains as to the full impact of aca on our business while these provisions may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact our services and business practices we cannot predict the effect if any the remaining aca changes may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses and it is possible that other unanticipated legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system could also occur 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally 

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price “awp” or wholesale acquisition cost “wac” which are the pricing references used for many of our pbm and ltc client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments future changes to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death product liability or 

personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customers and the demand for our products and services including propriety brands 

the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty 

moreover customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our retail customers not only facetoface in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media our customers are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation if we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected 

finally our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients as a result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit cards debit cards gift cards and potentially other technologies in the future acceptance of these payment methods subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment options including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and various other forms of electronic payment if these companies are unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised our operations could be disrupted the payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses in the payment systems if we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements or if data relating to our payment systems is compromised due to a breach or misuse we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reduced sales and adverse effects on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully integrate companies acquired by us 

upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the products services and related assets into our business operations if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business its products services and related assets into our company may also be complex and timeconsuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of an acquisition furthermore these acquisitions even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products services or geographic markets and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them 

our outstanding debt and associated payment obligations could among other things limit our ability to make incremental investments in our business 

our current debt service costs associated with our increased debt levels may dampen incremental investments in our business and limit our   flexibility to respond to industry changes and market conditions in addition our debt level and related debt service obligations could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any required future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to the seasonality of our business 

although the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well this could lead to lost sales as well as increased snow removal and other costs thereby negatively affecting our shortterm results of operations in addition both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year 

risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

pharmacy services retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries we are currently subject to various litigation matters investigations audits inspections government inquiries and regulatory and legal proceedings litigation and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation is often expensive and disruptive further under the qui tam  or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state health care programs including medicare and medicaid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be required to materially change our business practices as a result of such proceedings we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

the foregoing is not a comprehensive listing of all possible risks and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business as such we refer you to “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes our “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” at the end of such section of our annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2015 which section is incorporated by reference herein

clinical services   we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote safety and to help target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management quality assurance adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies 

  

disease management programs   our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties our accordant ® programs include integrated rare disease management programs which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis parkinson’s disease seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance “ncqa” a private notforprofit organization that evaluates accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations they have also been awarded case management accreditation from urac

pharmacy services seasonality   the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature however our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d standard benefit design results in coverage that varies with a members cumulative annual outofpocket costs the benefit design generally results in plan sponsors sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early part of the year as a result the pdp plan pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating profit generally increases as the year progresses 

pharmacy services competition   we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred formularies vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members and ix operational excellence in delivering services the pharmacy services segment has a significant number of competitors offering pbm services eg express scripts optumrx catamaran prime therapeutics medimpact and humana including large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms

retail pharmacy business strategy   our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and recommending more cost effective drug therapies in addition personalization is central to our retail strategy our customerdriven personalization through extracare ®  extracare beauty club ®  and myweeklyad tm  are designed to help us connect directly with individual consumers to deliver a personalized experience we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction

retail pharmacy segment net revenues by major product group are as follows 



   

pharmacy   pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the impact of expanded health insurance coverage through the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “aca” the introduction of new pharmaceutical products and medicare part d we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology as well as our innovative partnerships with health plans pbms and providers given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology and ready when promised consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program maintenance choice ®  a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order and pharmacy advisor ®  our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions as well as specialty connect tm  our integrated specialty pharmacy offering that began in 2014 which integrates specialty mail and retail capabilities providing members with diseasestate specific counseling from our experienced specialty pharmacists and the choice to bring their specialty prescriptions to a cvspharmacy location or submit it through our specialty mail order pharmacies maintenance choice pharmacy advisor and specialty connect are all programs that demonstrate our ability to enhance the customer experience through our integrated enterprise products and services further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that helps check for harmful interactions between prescription drugs and patient identified overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our proprietary pharmacy system that integrates our product delivery and clinical workflows as well as advanced patient safety functionality such as drug utilization review rx connect our prescription refill program readyfill ®  and our online retail businesses cvscom navarrocom and onofrecombr 

  

front store   front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative personalized marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits similar to extracare is the beauty club another program that rewards our loyal customers with sales prices and customized coupons we continue to launch new and exclusive brands like salma hayek nuance tm  makeup academy tm  and nyx ®  to create unmatched offerings in beauty another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvspharmacy ® and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvspharmacy stores we currently carry over 5200 cvspharmacy and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 195 of our front store revenues during 2014 these products include expanded offerings of healthy foods and vitamins furthermore we are tailoring certain groups of stores such as suburban area stores to better meet the needs of our customers 

minuteclinic   as of december 31 2014 we operated 971  minuteclinic ® locations in 31 states and the district of columbia of which 963  were located in cvspharmacy stores we opened 175 new clinics during 2014 minuteclinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to diagnose and treat minor health conditions perform health screenings monitor chronic conditions provide wellness services and deliver vaccinations insurers value minuteclinic because it provides convenient highquality costeffective care in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care as a result visits paid for by employers health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 85 of minuteclinic’s total revenues in 2014 minuteclinic is collaborating with our pharmacy services segment to help meet the needs of cvscaremark’s client plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs minuteclinic is now affiliated with 49 major health systems and continues to build a platform that supports primary care 

  

onsite pharmacies   we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites under the careplus ®  careplus cvspharmacy ®  cvspharmacy ® or wellness works pharmacy name which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

  

retail pharmacy store development   the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a key role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient sites during 2014 we opened 151 new retail pharmacy 

stores acquired 33 stores relocated 60 stores and closed 22 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1200 new and relocated stores and acquired 125 stores during 2015 we expect square footage growth of approximately 2 we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in more accessible markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position given the changing health care landscape and to meet the increasing needs of our customers

retail pharmacy customers   managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 986 of our 2014 pharmacy revenues the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single retail payor accounts for 10 or more of our annual consolidated revenues however the success of our retail drugstore business is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms 

  

retail pharmacy seasonality   the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season in addition both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season for additional information we refer you to “risks related to the seasonality of our business” in item 1a risk factors 

  

retail pharmacy competition   the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in the markets we serve we compete with other drugstore chains eg walgreens and rite aid supermarkets discount retailers eg walmart and target independent pharmacies restrictive pharmacy networks membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms

laws and regulations related to each operating segment of our business 

laws related to reimbursement by government programs   we are subject to various state and federal laws concerning our submission of claims for reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties multiples damages and exclusion from participation in government health care programs such laws include the federal false claims act “fca” various state false claims acts the federal “stark law” and related state laws in particular the fca prohibits intentionally submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs as part of aca the federal antikickback statute was amended in 2010 to provide that any claim for government reimbursement violates the fca where it results from a violation of the antikickback statute most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the fca and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam  or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government further the federal stark law generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services including outpatient prescription drugs to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship the stark law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral various states have enacted similar laws 

antiremuneration laws   federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs 

  

antitrust and unfair competition   the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or cvspharmacy plays a unique or expanded role in a pbm product offering our business arrangements and uses of confidential information may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties 

privacy and confidentiality requirements   many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes when permitted additionally there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit   credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have recently incorporated these requirements into state laws 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 amended hipaa to impose additional restrictions on thirdparty funded communications using phi and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for phi it also extended hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates in addition to hipaa state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

  

finally the health insurance marketplaces formerly known as the “exchanges” are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to pii and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of pii as those the health insurance marketplace has implemented for itself or nonhealth insurance marketplace entities which include insurers 

offering plans through the health insurance marketplaces and their designated downstream entities including pbms and other business associates these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

consumer protection laws   the federal government has many consumer protection laws such as the ftca the federal postal service act and the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule most states also have similar consumer protection laws these laws have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services pricing accuracy expired front store products financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected 

government agreements and mandates   the company andor its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees settlement agreements and corporate integrity agreements with various federal state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices pseudoephedrine products medicare part d prescription drug plans expired products environmental and safety matters marketing and advertising practices pbm and pharmacy operations and various other business practices these agreements contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company failure to meet the company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies financial penalties administrative remedies andor exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 

environmental and safety regulation   our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment public health and employee safety including for example regulations governing the management of hazardous substances the cleaning up of contaminated sites and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores distribution centers and other facilities governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail and healthcare sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

health reform legislation   passed in 2010 aca affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients as a result these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices given that many of the regulations implementing aca are still being finalized and that subregulatory guidance is still being issued the full impact of aca on our company is uncertain 

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation   we are subject to a variety of intersecting state and federal statutes and regulations that govern the wholesale distribution of drugs operation of retail specialty infusion and mail order pharmacies licensure of facilities and professionals including pharmacists technicians and nurses registration of facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” and analogous state agencies that regulate controlled substances packaging storing and shipping of pharmaceuticals repackaging of drug products labeling medication guides and other consumer disclosures interactions with prescribers and healthcare professionals compounding of prescription medications dispensing of controlled and noncontrolled substances counseling of patients transfers of prescriptions advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services security inventory control recordkeeping reporting to boards of pharmacy the united states food and drug administration “fda” the consumer product safety commission the dea and related state agencies and other elements of pharmacy practice pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with a wide variety of local state and federal agencies with various powers to investigate audit or solicit information including boards of pharmacy and nursing the dea the fda the united states department of justice the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and others many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers conduct audits on a regular basis can impose substantial fines and penalties and may revoke the license registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional 

telemarketing and other outbound contacts   certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act give the ftc federal communications commission “fcc” and state attorneys general the ability to regulate and bring enforcement actions relating to telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails under certain circumstances these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions 

laws and regulations related to our pharmacy services segment 

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect our business as a whole we are subject to federal state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation of our pharmacy services segment specifically among these are the following 

pbm laws and regulation   legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as the ncqa and urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

medicare part d   the medicare part d program which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible medicare beneficiaries through private insurers regulates all aspects of the provision of medicare drug coverage including enrollment formularies pharmacy networks marketing and claims processing the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception and continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve cms has imposed restrictions and issued new requirements to protect medicare part d beneficiaries and has used its authority to sanction and impose civil monetary penalties on plans for noncompliance 

network access legislation   medicare part d and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

also a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability and the health plans’ ability to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to us for payment these laws could negatively impact our ability to recover overpayments in health care payments stemming from pharmacy audits lastly several states have passed legislation regulating our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs “mac” mac methodology is a common cost management practice used to pay pharmacies for dispensing generic prescription drugs including private and public payors mac prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a pbm for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is available from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices state legislation can regulate the disclosure of mac prices and mac price methodologies the kinds of drugs that a pbm can pay at a mac price and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a mac price established by a pbm these laws could negatively impact our ability to establish mac prices for generic drugs 

contract audits   we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our contracts relating to medicare part d and the agreement our pharmacies enter into with payors because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations 

federal employee health benefits program   we have a contractual arrangement with the bluecross blueshield association to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the federal employees health benefits act “fehba” and as part of the federal employees health benefits program this arrangement subjects us to fehba and other federal regulations such as the federal employees health benefits acquisition regulation that otherwise are not applicable to us 

state insurance laws   pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however as a pdp silverscript is subject to state insurance laws limited to licensure and solvency in addition pbm offerings of prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepting material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits may be 

subject to laws and regulations in various states such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

  

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application 

erisa regulation   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan and with respect to the contraceptive coverage mandate one of the health reforms included in aca 

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

formulary and plan design regulation   a number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits hhs regulates how medicare part d formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions under aca cms imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits including plans offered through federal or state exchanges additionally the naic and health care accreditation agencies like the ncqa and urac have developed model acts and standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions for insurers mcos and medicaid managed care plans the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies networks and other plan design features on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients similarly some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features this regulation could limit or preclude i limited networks ii a requirement to use particular providers iii copayment differentials among providers and iv formulary tiering practices 

managed care reform   in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

disease management services regulation   we provide disease management programs to pbm plan members for rare medical conditions and arrange for them to receive disease management programs for common medical conditions state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of disease management services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm and retail pharmacy 

  

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive in addition changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing including our ability to collect transmission fees could adversely impact our profitability 

our retail pharmacy segment has also been impacted by the margin pressures described above including client demands for lower prices generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive in addition many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues any negative impact in our retail pharmacy could outweigh an increase in our own mail order business andor an increase in participation in our maintenance choice program 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

  

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are continuing at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices a change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability 

  

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price a pricing element common to most payment formulas and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

a highly competitive business environment 

  

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pharmacy services business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment our competitive success is impacted by the ability of our retail pharmacy business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms and by the ability of our pharmacy services business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

  

as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies convenience stores and mass merchants many of which are expanding into markets we serve we also face competition from retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future 

  

competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts optumrx catamaran prime therapeutics medimpact and humana include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing industry we may be unable to remain competitive in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

risks related to compliance with a broad and complex regulatory framework 

  

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business  government regulation” in addition during the past several years the united states health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of registrations or licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards securities laws and regulations tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and laws and regulations of the ftc the fcc and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell such as boards of pharmacy the fda dea and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations in addition our business interests outside of the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations we are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates including those described in the government regulation section in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative regulatory action and enforcement activity including without limitation any one or more of the following 

  

 

   

   

 

   

 

 

 

 

   

   

 

   

 

   

   

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

  

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns although an economic recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause a decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms these circumstances could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business 

  

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base further the pbm industry has been impacted by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect 

on our business and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

  

the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents 

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of   sensitive customer and business information 

  

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems we rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claims processing extracare customer loyalty program finance human resource and other processes throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card information breaches vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities including ones from a cybersecurity standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties 

if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 

  

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

  

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail and mailorder pharmacies and through our pbm’s network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced for example on october 6 2014 the final dea rule moving hydrocodone combination products from schedule iii to schedule ii became effective 

additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

  

since its inception in 2006 medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures further as a result of aca and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this 

occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if changes to the regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be negatively impacted 

  

reform of the united states health care system 

  

congressional efforts to reform the united states health care system finally came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of aca which is resulting in significant structural changes to the health insurance system see “business  government regulation” 

although many of the structural changes enacted by aca were implemented in 2014 some of the applicable regulations and subregulatory guidance have not yet been issued andor finalized therefore there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of aca on our business while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including plan designs that include limited networks a requirement to use mail service pharmacies for certain medications or formulary tiering as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices we cannot predict what effect if any all of the aca changes may have on our retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses and it is possible that other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that we cannot anticipate could also occur 

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks 

  

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price “awp” which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

product liability product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage 

the products that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our business involves the provision of professional services including by pharmacists nurses and nurse practitioners that exposes us to professional liability claims should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

relationship with our retail customers and the demand for our products and services including propriety brands 

the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services 

we offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites the sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source market and sell privatelabel products any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships our ability to locate qualified economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other things that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty 

finally customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our retail customers not only facetoface in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media our customers are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation if we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected 

risks related to the seasonality of our business 

although the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact consumer shopping patterns as well this could lead to lost sales as well as increased snow removal and other costs thereby negatively affecting our shortterm results of operations in addition both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which is susceptible to large fluctuations from year to year 

risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

  

pharmacy services and retail pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries we are currently subject to various litigation matters investigations audits government inquiries regulatory and legal proceedings litigation and particularly securities and collective or class action litigation is often expensive and disruptive we cannot predict the outcome of such matters and the costs incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be required to materially change our business practices as a result of such proceedings we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information

discounted drug purchase arrangements   we negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to clients that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for volume discounts andor the payment by the pharmaceutical companies of retroactive discounts or rebates from established list prices for certain products that are purchased by our pharmacies we receive discounts at the time of purchase andor discounts for prompt payment of invoices we also receive various purchase discounts under our wholesale contracts which may include retroactive discounts or rebates if we exceed contractuallydefined purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues

united states including puerto rico and the district of columbia when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility while also performing a drug utilization review to evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

  

prescription management systems   we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail service or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service dispensing pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating review of various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

  

clinical services   we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote safety and to target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact member health and client pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management quality assurance adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies

pharmacy services seasonality   the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature 

pharmacy services competition   we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members the pharmacy services segment has a significant number of competitors offering pbm services eg express scripts optumrx catamaran and prime therapeutics including large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms 

  

retail pharmacy segment 

  

as of december 31 2013 the retail pharmacy segment included 7660  retail drugstores of which 7603  operated a pharmacy our online retail pharmacy websites cvscom and onofrecombr 17  onsite pharmacy stores and our retail health care clinics 

the retail drugstores are located in 43  states the district of columbia puerto rico and brazil operating primarily under the cvspharmacy ®  longs drugs ®  and drogaria onofre ®  names we currently operate in 95 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 86 of these markets cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of overthecounter and personal care products beauty and cosmetic products and general merchandise which we refer to as “front store” products existing retail stores range in size from approximately 5000 to 30000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 8000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during 2013 we filled 734 million retail prescriptions or approximately 21 of the us retail pharmacy market 

  

as of december 31 2013 we operated 800  retail health care clinics in 28 states and the district of columbia under the minuteclinic ® name 792  of which were located within cvspharmacy stores 

  

retail pharmacy business strategy   our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and more cost effective drug therapies in addition personalization is core to our retail strategy we have a number of initiatives underway such as extracare and a weekly individually tailored circular that acts as a personal shopper for the customer that are designed to help us connect directly with individual consumers to deliver a personalized experience we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

  

retail pharmacy products and services   a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on the business 

retail pharmacy segment net revenues by major product group are as follows 

  



   

pharmacy   pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the impact of expanded health insurance coverage through the affordable care act the introduction of new pharmaceutical products medicare part d and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology and ready when promised consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program maintenance choice ®  a program where eligible client plan members can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores for the same price as mail order and pharmacy advisor ®  our program that facilitates pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating 

plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect our prescription refill program readyfill ®  and our online business cvscom ®  

  

front store   front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states in addition the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvspharmacy ® and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvspharmacy stores we currently carry over 4300 cvspharmacy and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 18 of our front store revenues during 2013 furthermore we are tailoring certain groups of stores such as our urban cluster stores to better meet the needs of our customers 

minuteclinic   as of december 31 2013 we operated 800  minuteclinic ® locations in 28 states and the district of columbia of which 792  were located in cvspharmacy stores minuteclinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions perform health screenings monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations many locations have also begun treating a variety of chronic conditions insurers value minuteclinic because it provides convenient highquality costeffective care in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care as a result visits paid for by employers health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 85 of minuteclinic’s total revenues in 2013 we anticipate opening up approximately 150 new clinics in cvspharmacy stores during 2014 minuteclinic is collaborating with our pharmacy services segment to help meet the needs of cvs caremark’s client plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs minuteclinic is now affiliated with 30 major health systems 

  

onsite pharmacies   we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites under the careplus cvspharmacy ® or cvspharmacy ® name which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

  

retail pharmacy store development   the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2013 we opened 169 new retail pharmacy stores relocated 78 stores and closed 13 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1300 new and relocated stores and acquired 82 stores during 2014 we expect square footage growth of between 2 to 3 we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current health care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

  

retail pharmacy information systems   we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver exceptional customer service enhance safety and quality and expand our patient care services while lowering operating costs in 2012 we completed the rollout of our proprietary wecare workflow to all retail pharmacy locations wecare workflow is an integrated suite of enhancements to our rxconnect fulfillment system pharmacy pos terminals and phone system to support our pharmacy colleagues and customers by seamlessly integrating and prioritizing prescription fulfillment prescriber contact management customer service actions and patient care interventions into a cohesive workflow in the near term this solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances the customer experience longer term the solution provides a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of our clinical programs our consumer engagement engine ®  technology and proprietary clinical algorithms enable us to identify opportunities for our pharmacists to deliver facetoface counseling regarding patient health and safety matters including adherence issues gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions our digital strategy empowers the consumer to navigate their pharmacy experience and manage their condition through our online and mobile tools that offer utility and convenience cvscom gained a new look and added new tools such as access to worldclass drug information and personalization of pharmacy services we experienced strong adoption of our digital solutions with our mobile app receiving critical acclaim for ease of use and our text message program experiencing unprecedented growth 

  

retail pharmacy customers   managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 979 of our 

2013 pharmacy revenues the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single retail payor accounts for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues however the success of our retail drugstore business is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms our contracts with commercial payors and governmentfunded programs are subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates see “government regulation — reimbursement” and item 1a “risk factors — efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices” 

  

retail pharmacy seasonality   the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to note 16 “quarterly financial information” in our annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2013 which section is incorporated by reference herein 

  

retail pharmacy competition   the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in the markets we serve we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms

environmental regulation   our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent 

years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities 

  

erisa regulation   the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan and with respect to the contraceptive coverage mandate one of the health reforms included in aca we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are similar but not identical to the health care antiremuneration statutes discussed above although erisa lacks the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions incorporated into the health care statutes similar to these health care statutes the corresponding provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

  

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

  

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes   a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act “fca” which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 “fera” implemented substantial changes to the fca which expands the scope of fca liability provides for new investigative tools and makes it easier for qui tam  relators often referred to as “whistleblowers” to bring and maintain fca suits on behalf of the government aca further eased the burden for whistleblowers to bring and maintain fca suits by modifying the “public disclosure” and “original source” provisions of the fca most states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state government authorities have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws and they have conducted numerous investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

fda regulation   the united states food and drug administration “fda” generally has authority to regulate drugs drug classifications and drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer the fda also has the regulatory authority i over many of the products sold through retail pharmacies including certain food items cosmetics dietary supplements and overthecounter “otc” medications and ii to require the submission and implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy “rems” if the fda determines that a rems is necessary for the safe and effective marketing of a drug to the extent we dispense products subject to rems requirements or provide rems services to pharmaceutical manufacturers we are subject to audit by the fda and the pharmaceutical manufacturer the fda also has regulatory authority over medical devices such as otc genetic tests and genetic tests conducted by medical laboratories and the fda continues to evaluate the need for further regulation of such tests 

  

federal employee health benefits program   we have a contractual arrangement with the bluecross blueshield association “bcbsa” to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the federal employees health benefits act “fehba” and as part of the federal employees health benefits program “fehbp” this arrangement subjects us to fehba and other federal regulations such as the federal employees health benefits acquisition regulation that otherwise are not applicable to us 

formulary regulation   a number of states regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits additionally the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation medicare part d regulates how formularies are developed and administered including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories subject to limited exceptions on a medicare part d plans formulary acas essential health benefits rule also imposes minimum drug coverage 

requirement for health plans subject to these requirements including plans offered through the federal or state exchanges the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients 

  

government agreements and mandates   in march 2008 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government and a number of states related to the dispensing of the generic drug ranitidine at its retail pharmacies at the same time the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig for a period of five years applicable to certain retail and mail service operations of the company this 2008 corporate integrity agreement requires among other things maintenance of our compliance program employee training specific reviews by an independent review organization and various government reporting obligations in april 2011 we entered into an amendment of the corporate integrity agreement in connection with the previously announced settlement of a federal and state government investigation of certain retail pharmacy billing practices with respect to “dual eligible” customers having both medicaid coverage and other thirdparty insurance coverage this amendment requires the company to comply with the corporate integrity agreement as amended for a period of three years and further requires among other things additional employee training obligations additional reporting obligations and periodic medicaid billing reviews by an independent review organization failure to meet our obligations under this corporate integrity agreement as amended could result in stipulated financial penalties and failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our applicable business from participation in federal health care programs 

in january 2009 we entered into separate settlement agreements with the ftc and the hhs office for civil rights “ocr” resolving a joint investigation of disposal of patient information at a limited number of cvspharmacy locations as part of the ftc settlement we agreed to maintain an appropriate enterprisewide information security program during the twentyyear term of the agreement with biennial compliance monitoring by an external assessor as part of the ocr settlement we agreed to maintain confidential waste disposal policies and procedures training and employee sanctions at our retail stores the ocr settlement provided for annual compliance monitoring by an external assessor in june 2013 we received from the ocr a closure letter that noted we were in material compliance with our ocr settlement agreement and we had significantly improved our retail store processes surrounding protected health information and that our mandatory monitoring and reporting obligations were satisfied 

  

in october 2010 the company entered into a nonprosecution agreement and civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice “doj” and various united states attorneys’ offices relating to the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine products at certain cvspharmacy stores primarily in california and nevada the company also entered into a related memorandum of agreement with the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the nonprosecution agreement and the memorandum of agreement contain certain ongoing compliance requirements for the company and failure to comply with the terms of these documents could lead to civil or criminal remedies financial penalties andor administrative remedies against the dea registrations for our retail pharmacies and distribution centers the term of the nonprosecution agreement was three years and ended in october 2013 the term of the memorandum of agreement is five years 

  

in may 2012 a previously announced proposed consent order between the ftc and the company became final and concluded an ftc investigation of the company that commenced in 2009 the final consent order prohibits the company from misrepresenting the price or cost of medicare part d prescription drugs or other prices or costs associated with medicare part d prescription drug plans 

  

on october 12 2012 the dea administrator published its final decision and order revoking the dea license registrations for dispensing controlled substances at two of our retail pharmacy stores in sanford florida the license revocations for the two stores formally became effective on november 13 2012 the pharmacies had voluntarily suspended dispensing controlled substances since april 2012 and have continued operating in that manner in compliance with the dea order 

  

in addition to the government agreements described above the company andor its various affiliates are subject to other consent decrees or settlement agreements with various federal state and local authorities that may contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company these agreements relate to such matters as privacy practices waste disposal practices selling expired products environmental and safety matters tobacco sales marketing and advertising practices pharmacy operations and various other business practices 

  

health reform legislation   congress passed major health reform legislation in 2010 referred to in this document as aca this legislation affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage beginning in 2014 aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms while not all of these reforms affect our business directly many affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result these reforms could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices and in many other cases directly impact our services and business practices given that many of the regulations implementing aca 

are still being finalized and that ongoing subregulatory guidance is still being issued there is considerable uncertainty as to its full impact on our company 

  

managed care reform   in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

medicare part d   the medicare part d program which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible medicare beneficiaries through private insurers regulates all aspects of the provision of medicare drug coverage including enrollment formularies pharmacy networks marketing and claims processing the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception including changes made by aca 

in april 2012 cms issued a rule that requires coverage other than basic prescription drug coverage offered through medicare part d employer group waiver plans “egwps” to be included in the definition of “other health or prescription drug coverage” starting january 1 2014 cms has clarified that because the supplemental benefits primarily reduce cost sharing on claims covered under the basic benefit they will continue as a practical matter to be subject to the medicare part d rules 

  

medicare part d continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve cms sanctions for noncompliance may include suspension of enrollment and even termination from the program cms has imposed restrictions and consent requirements for automatic prescription delivery programs further limited the circumstances under which medicare part d plans may recoup payments to pharmacies for claims that are subsequently determined not payable under medicare part d and is expected to issue a proposed regulation that may limit the ability of medicare part d plans to establish preferred pharmacy networks accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments and regulatory oversight could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

  

network access legislation   a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our clients or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm clients such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

  

pbm laws and regulation   legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that may impact our company to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the naic have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as the national committee for quality assurance and the urac may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation   we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies the transfer of prescriptions repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substance and listed chemical products and medical and controlled substance waste disposal federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and some state regulations require compliance with standards established by the united states pharmacopeia with respect to the packaging storing and shipping of pharmaceuticals federal and state controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and distribution centers with the dea and state controlled substances agencies and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control personnel and labeling standards in order to 

possess and dispense controlled substances and listed chemical products we undergo audits by these regulatory bodies on a regular basis 

  

plan design legislation   some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our clients and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

  

privacy and confidentiality requirements   many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy protections and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” hipaa also gives individuals certain rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain the individual’s written authorization criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards in january 2013 hhs issued a rule implementing the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 among other things the rule expands the circumstances under which authorizations are required to send communications to individuals that are funded by third parties and extends hipaa privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates of covered entities 

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

  

hhs has also issued regulations requiring federal and state exchanges to impose privacy and security standards on nonexchange entities to protect pii obtained through the exchanges beginning in 2014 in proposed regulations hhs has defined the term “nonexchange entities” to include insurers offering plans through the exchanges and would require that these entities in turn impose the same or more stringent privacy and security standards on their “downstream entities” if this rule is finalized as proposed unless hipaacovered entities are able to negotiate with an exchange to accept compliance with hipaa privacy and security standards as a substitute for complying with the exchange privacy and security standards insurers offering plans through the exchanges and their business associates could potentially be subject to additional privacy and security standards in addition to hipaa and existing more stringent state laws 

  

reimbursement   a significant portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state reimbursement laws and regulatory requirements antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws see the “selfreferral laws” section below for explanation of the stark law sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

changes in reporting of average wholesale price “awp” average manufacturer price “amp” or average sales price which are pricing elements common to most payment formulas or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors andor could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail and mail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

  

reimportation   the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts 

to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new or pending health legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

  

retail clinics   states regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics 

  

safety regulations   the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated under osha and various record keeping reporting and procedural requirements many of these osha standards as well as various state and local laws and regulations pertaining to employee safety and health including some that apply specifically to healthcare employees apply to our operations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

  

selfreferral laws   the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors 

violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

  

state insurance laws   pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans the company offers a pdp through silverscript which is subject to state insurance laws regarding licensure and solvency 

  

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our clients or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

  

telemarketing and other outbound contacts   certain federal and state laws such as the telephone consumer protection act tcpa give the ftc federal communications commission fcc and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails these laws may among other things impose registration requirements require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when where and how consumers may be contacted require consumer consent prior to being contacted require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services require the establishment of certain policies and training of personnel and require the retention of specific business records in october 2013 new fcc rules went into effect aimed at better aligning the fcc’s regulatory response under the tcpa with the ftc’s response as well as requiring written prior consent for calls using an automatic telephone dialing system call to a mobile number or an artificial or prerecorded 

voice call to a residential or mobile number the company’s use of telemarketing and other outbound contacts could be impacted by these laws and regulations 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws   many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

  

whistleblower statutes   certain federal and state laws including the fca contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam  or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation because a qui tam  lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

although we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our various business lines we cannot give any assurances that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam  lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam  lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

  

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns although an economic recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause a decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms these circumstances could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

  

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this dynamic may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs 

  

in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices 

  

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of amp and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

  

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business 

  

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract in addition the reputational impact of a servicerelated incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base further the pbm industry has been impacted by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm clients is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business these circumstances either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results therefore we continually face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms 

  

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

  

the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents 

  

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

  

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail and mailorder pharmacies and through our pbms network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur or drugs become subject to greater restrictions as controlled substances physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such regulatory rulings or market changes 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

  

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard we maintain contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and financial results could be adversely affected further competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused our pbm and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive our retail pharmacy segment has also been impacted by the margin pressures described above 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

  

since its inception in 2006 medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of aca and changes to medicare part d such as the elimination in 2013 of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restrictions that may be imposed by cms if we fail to effectively integrate and operate the medicare part d businesses we have acquired or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be impacted 

  

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks 

  

it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

  

an extremely competitive business environment 

  

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pharmacy services business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment our competitive success is impacted by the ability of our retail pharmacy business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms and by the ability of our pharmacy services business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

  

as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance 

medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues any negative impact in our retail pharmacy could outweigh an increase in our own mail order business andor an increase in participation in our maintenance choice program in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future 

  

competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts optumrx catamaran and prime therapeutics include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings particularly in a rapidly changing industry we may be unable to remain competitive in addition changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could adversely affect our claims volume andor our competitiveness generally 

relationship with our retail customers and the demand for our products and services 

the success of our retail business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our proprietary brands failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns an inability to expand the products being purchased by our customers or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services 

reform of the us health care system 

  

congressional efforts to reform the us health care system finally came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of aca which is resulting in significant structural changes to the health insurance system see “business  government regulation” 

many of the structural changes enacted by aca are being implemented in 2014 and some of the applicable regulations and subregulatory guidance have not yet been issued andor finalized therefore there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of aca on our business while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices we cannot predict what effect if any the aca changes may have on our retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses and it is possible that other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that we cannot anticipate could also occur 

  

the failure or disruption of our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of   sensitive customer and business information 

  

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including personally identifiable information that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card information breaches vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities including ones from a cybersecurity standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations moreover a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes

we make recommendations to our clients encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug we believe that we help our clients control costs by recommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our clients also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists 

  

formulary management  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for members and clients we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug lists and generic equivalent products as well as our clinical programs many of our clients choose to adopt our drug lists as part of their plan design 

  

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to clients that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for volume discounts andor the payment by the pharmaceutical companies of retroactive discounts or rebates from established list prices for certain products that are purchased by our pharmacies we receive discounts at the time of purchase andor discounts for prompt payment of invoices we also receive various purchase discounts under our wholesale contracts which may include retroactive discounts or rebates if we exceed contractuallydefined purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues

generic substitution therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to reduce cost and improve quality of treatment

retail pharmacy business strategy  our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and more cost effective drug therapies in addition we seek to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our strategy is to have convenientlylocated stores many of which are open extendedhours or 24hours per day and to offer drivethrough pharmacy services where practicable we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction

pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2012 2011 and 2010 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the impact of health care reform the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products medicare part d and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program our customer savings initiative which educates customers about cost savings opportunities maintenance choice pharmacy advisor our program that uses our consumer engagement engine technology to facilitate pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions and the extracare health card program further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill ®  and our online business cvscom ®

retail pharmacy customers  managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 975 of our 2012 pharmacy revenues the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single retail payor accounts for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues however the success of our retail drugstore business is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms during 2012 express scripts completed a merger with medco health solutions thereby creating the largest pbm in the nation in 2012 express scripts accounted for approximately 18 of our retail pharmacy segment revenues our contracts with commercial payors and governmentfunded programs are subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates see “government regulation — reimbursement” and item 1a “risk factors — efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices ”

electronic prescribing  the federal government has implemented different programs to promote electronic prescribing including the erx incentive program established under the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 which provides a combination of incentive payments and payment adjustments through 2014 to eligible professionals who are successful electronic prescribers while this program sunsets after 2014 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” established an incentive program for eligible professionals and hospitals participating in the medicare or medicaid program that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health records “ehr” technology beginning in 2011 arra also provides for downward payment adjustments beginning in 2015 for eligible professionals in the medicare program that fail to adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr technology such as electronic prescribing a final rule implementing the stage 1 criteria that eligible professionals must meet in order to qualify for medicare andor medicaid ehr incentive payments was issued in july 2010 and requires that at least 40 of permissible prescriptions be sent electronically in order to qualify for the incentive payments the final rule specifying the stage 2 criteria was issued in september 2012 which among other things requires that more than 50 percent of all permissible prescriptions written by an eligible professional be queried for a drug formulary and transmitted electronically using a certified ehr technology in march 2010 the us drug enforcement administration “dea” issued an interim final rule allowing electronic prescribing of controlled substances beginning june 1 2010 these changes together with the requirement for medicare part d plans to support electronic prescribing should result in a growing number of prescribers adopting electronic prescribing 

  

environmental regulation  our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities there is also an increased interest by regulators in better managing photo processing as well as pharmaceutical and other wastes our retail pharmacies have been subject to various state environmental agency enforcement actions and we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies 

  

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

  

  

erisa fiduciaries may be held personally liable for entering into service contracts or arrangements like pbm contracts on behalf of erisa plans if the terms of the contract are not reasonable or if the service provider receives more than reasonable compensation for the services provided in such cases the service provider may also be required to disgorge any unreasonable compensation received and may be subject to civil penalties imposed by the us department of labor “dol” 

  

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are similar but not identical to the health care antiremuneration statutes discussed above although erisa lacks the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions incorporated into the health care statutes similar to these health care statutes the corresponding provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

  

most pension and welfare plans subject to erisa are required to report to the dol compensation paid to service providers in addition the dol announced a project in 2009 to promulgate regulations under erisa that could require service providers including pbms to provide detailed disclosure regarding all direct and indirect compensation to be received in connection with the services provided as well as potential conflicts of interest the dol issued supplemental “frequently asked questions” in 2010 that specifically addressed pbm disclosure of certain compensation including i fees for services such as dispensing fees and administrative fees which are reportable as direct compensation and ii discounts and rebates received by pbms from pharmaceutical companies which pending further guidance from the dol generally do not need to be treated as reportable indirect compensation in february 2012 the dol issued final regulations that impose numerous disclosure requirements on service providers and provide that contracts or arrangements with service providers will not be considered “reasonable” under erisa unless the required disclosures are made the required disclosures must be timely made to plan fiduciaries and must include among other things a description of the services provided a description of direct and indirect compensation for the services and a description of the compensation expected to be received upon termination of the contract or arrangement 

  

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

  

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the fca which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 “fera” implemented substantial changes to the fca which expand the scope of fca liability provide for new investigative tools and make it easier for qui tam relators often referred to as “whistleblowers” to bring and maintain fca suits on behalf of the government aca further eased the burden for whistleblowers to bring and maintain fca suits by modifying the “public disclosure” and “original source” provisions of the fca some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws fera also expanded the fca to cover improperly avoiding an obligation to pay money to the government and aca clarified that the retention of overpayments beyond the repayment deadline is a violation of the fca in addition aca provides that a violation of the federal antiremuneration law constitutes a false or fraudulent act under the fca and expands the jurisdiction of the fca to the health insurance exchanges to be created under aca aca also provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made any false or fraudulent record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment under a governmentsponsored program for knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment and for false statements in provider enrollment applications the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section in recent years federal and state government authorities have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws and they have conducted numerous investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

  

fda regulation  the united states food and drug administration “fda” generally has authority to regulate drugs drug classifications and drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer the fda also has the regulatory authority over many of the products sold through retail pharmacies including certain food items cosmetics dietary supplements and overthecounter “otc” medications we previously operated a fdaregulated repackaging facility where we repackaged certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies but we closed this repackaging facility in april 2010 the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs or other fdaregulated products as well as procedures to comply with food safety regulations in addition the fda has authority to require the submission and implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy “rems” if the fda determines that that a rems is necessary for the safe and effective marketing of a drug to the extent we dispense products subject to rems requirements or provide rems services to pharmaceutical manufacturers we are subject to audit by the fda and the pharmaceutical manufacturer the fda also has regulatory authority over medical devices such as otc genetic tests and genetic tests conducted by medical laboratories and the fda continues to evaluate the need for further regulation of such tests

formulary regulation  a number of states regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of medicare part d in july 2008 congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act which requires the secretary for hhs to identify certain classes and categories of drugs for which subject to certain exceptions all the drugs in any such class or category must be included in a medicare part d plan’s formulary aca’s essential health benefits rule will also regulate how prescription drugs are covered and how formularies are developed for and administered by statebased or federal health insurance exchanges established pursuant to aca these exchanges must begin enrolling consumers into coverage on october 1 2013 and become fully operational on january 1 2014 the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients

on october 12 2012 the dea administrator published its final decision and order revoking the dea license registrations for dispensing controlled substances at two of our retail pharmacy stores in sanford florida the license revocations for the two stores formally became effective on november 13 2012 the pharmacies previously had voluntarily suspended dispensing controlled substances since april 2012 and have continued operating in that manner in compliance with the dea order 

  

in addition to the government agreements described above the company andor its various affiliates are subject to other consent decrees or settlement agreements with various federal state and local authorities that may contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company these agreements relate to such matters as privacy practices waste disposal practices selling expired products environmental and safety matters tobacco sales marketing and advertising practices pharmacy operations and various other business practices 

  

health reform legislation  congress passed major health reform legislation in 2010 known as aca this legislation affects the entire health insurance system and virtually every aspect of health care in the country although many provisions of aca were not effective immediately in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage beginning in 2014 aca enacted a number of significant health care reforms while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices given that many of the regulations implementing aca are still being finalized and that ongoing subregulatory guidance is still being issued there is considerable uncertainty as to its full impact 

  

among the more significant aca provisions is the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees the mlr requires insurers to break out clinical quality improvement and administrative costs hhs issued an interim final regulation on the mlr in december 2010 that includes an example that could be interpreted to suggest that the differential between the drug price charged by pbms to health plans and the amount reimbursed to retail pharmacies commonly referred to as “differential” or “spread” should be excluded from claims costs subsequent subregulatory guidance remained consistent with this interpretation although it made clear that clinical services performed by a pbm could be included in claims costs health plan clients that are subject to the mlr requirements may request pricing modifications include requests to contract with our pbm using passthrough retail network pricing 

  

another aca provision requires pbms that contract with a medicare part d plan or a qualified health plan offered through a health insurance exchange to disclose certain information to hhs the medicare part d plan or the health insurance exchange among the information that must be disclosed is the generic dispensing rate for different types of pharmacies the aggregate amount and types of rebates and other discounts negotiated on behalf of and passed through to the plan and the aggregate amount of any differential a final rule requiring this reporting for medicare part d was issued in april 2012 and reporting for qualified health plans is expected in 2014 upon the implementation of the health insurance exchanges to be established under aca aca also increases the obligations of part d plan sponsors to report rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to enable calculation of new annual fees being imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers related to branded drug sales aca also made significant changes to the 

  

  

medicare and medicaid programs fraud and abuse laws and tax provisions some of which are discussed elsewhere in this government regulation section 

  

managed care reform  in addition to health reforms enacted by aca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

medicare part d  the mma created medicare part d the medicare drug benefit program in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for drug coverage under medicare part d regulations implementing medicare part d included requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks marketing of medicare part d plans processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception including changes made by aca effective for the 2010 plan year cms issued a regulation requiring that any “differential” or “spread” be reported as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost of the plan sponsor for purposes of calculating certain government subsidy payments and the drug price to be charged to enrollees this change resulted in medicare part d plan sponsors contracting for passthrough pricing for their retail networks rather than pricing that included the use of retail network “differential” or “spread” 

  

aca expanded the medicare part d benefit effective for the 2011 plan year by implementing the coverage gap discount program under which participating manufacturers fund discounts of 50 on brand drugs obtained during the coverage gap or “donut hole” and starting the phaseout of the coverage gap for generic drugs which is to be completed by 2020 

  

aca also requires the secretary of hhs to develop rules for shorter dispensing periods for enrollees in longterm care facilities in order to reduce waste several of the aca changes will require significant adjudication and reporting systems modifications in april 2012 cms issued a final rule on medicare part d that among other things would establish a daily cost sharing rate as a form of drug utilization management and certain fraud waste and abuse controls the rule also permits cms to terminate a medicare part d sponsor’s contract if it fails to achieve at least a 3star plan rating for three consecutive years finally the rule provides that beginning on january 1 2013 employer group waiver plan “egwp” supplemental benefits to basic medicare part d coverage must be treated as other health or prescription drug coverage and a nonmedicare benefit cms has since announced that it is delaying the implementation of this change in the definition of medicare part d supplemental benefits until 2014 in order to develop guidance to address the policy implications of this change including the applicability of other state and federal laws 

  

medicare part d continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

  

mental health parity legislation  the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 and its implementing regulations require group health plans that provide both medicalsurgical benefits and mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits to ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations that apply to the mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits are no more restrictive than those that apply to the medicalsurgical benefits while the implementing regulations contain a special rule allowing for “multitiered prescription drug benefits” that meet certain conditions there is considerable uncertainty regarding the application of this rule this has caused some group health plans to consider dropping mental health benefits including drugs that treat these conditions to avoid being found in violation of the regulation 

  

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in medicare part d and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d sponsor for each type of pharmacy in its network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our clients or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm clients such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

  

  

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may i prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network andor ii impact how we conduct audits of network pharmacies and recover audit discrepancies except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment or other pricing differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a medicare part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail network pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

  

pbm laws and regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to clients and plan members ii require pbms to disclose andor remit to clients or their plan members certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to clients and their plan members andor v impose licensing or registration requirements to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the naic have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as the national committee for quality assurance and the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities for example urac has issued pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark is currently accredited as a pbm by urac while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment 

  

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies the transfer of prescriptions repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substance and listed chemical products and medical and controlled substance waste disposal federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and some state regulations require compliance with standards established by the united states pharmacopeia with respect to the packaging storing and shipping of pharmaceuticals federal and state controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and distribution centers with the dea and state controlled substances agencies and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control personnel and labeling standards in order to possess and dispense controlled substances and listed chemical products 

  

we also are subject to regulation by the dea and state pharmacy boards in connection with our online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods numerous state laws also exist affecting our receipt and processing of electronic prescription drug orders 

  

certain violations of the federal controlled substances laws can subject the company its pharmacies and distribution centers and individual pharmacy personnel to criminal and civil penalties and can also result in administrative action by the dea including suspension or revocation of a pharmacy’s or distribution center’s registration to distribute controlled substances andor listed chemical products state authorities and state boards of pharmacy similarly have the authority to impose both monetary penalties and disciplinary sanctions including revocation of a pharmacy’s or individual pharmacist’s license to dispense controlled substances and these penalties and sanctions are in addition to sanctions imposed under the federal controlled substances laws certain violations of these federal and state legal requirements can also trigger other consequences for the company’s business and could potentially impact our eligibility to participate in federal health care programs 

  

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the ftc requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service and the department of transportation each has regulatory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail or in commerce and state licensing authorities may restrict the types of personnel who may work in mail service operations 

  

our pharmacists technicians and certain other health care professionals are subject to state regulation of their profession and our employees who are engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing or registration requirements and comply with applicable professional standards in addition they must comply with any applicable federal or state requirements for participation in governmentsponsored health care programs failure to comply with these requirements could subject us and our 

  

  

employees to disciplinary action including fines penalties or sanctions could impact our ability to obtain or retain reimbursement for services provided to participants of governmentsponsored health care programs andor could cause our licenses and permits and our employees’ licenses to be suspended or revoked 

  

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan member may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic interchange requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and aca requires the coverage of certain preventive services at no cost sharing such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our clients generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies or for use of certain health care providers legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our clients and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

  

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy protections and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” hipaa also gives individuals certain rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain the individual’s written authorization criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

  

in january 2013 hhs issued a final omnibus rule to covered the rulemaking required by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” enacted as part of arra to address significant changes to the hipaa privacy and security rules the rule addresses restrictions on the use of phi without an individual’s written authorization requirements to update a covered entity’s notice of privacy practices a requirement to account for routine disclosures of phi held in an electronic health record a requirement to notify individuals of breaches to their phi requirements limiting how a covered entity may receive financial remuneration to make communications to patients requirements to enforce hipaa privacy and security rules on business associates and their subcontractors enforcement rights of state attorneys general extension of the federal privacy and security law provisions and penalties to business associates of covered entities and increased penalties for violation of the law the effective date of this new rule is march 26 2013 and covered entities and business associates must comply with the applicable requirements by september 23 2013 this rule did not address changes to the requirements surrounding the accounting of disclosures to an individual of all internal uses and disclosures of electronic phi which were previously addressed in the may 2011 notice of proposed rulemaking “nprm” if hhs adopts the nprm as currently written it could generate substantial burdens and costs for the company and our business associates to implement fully nevertheless since the omnibus rule has just been issued and the nprm is not in final form we cannot at this time determine the full extent to which these changes may apply to or impact our business 

  

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa most states have also enacted legislation and regulations governing the security of pii and specifying notification requirements for any security breaches involving pii 

  

the genetic information nondiscrimination act “gina” was signed into law in may 2008 and proposed and interim final regulations were issued under it in 2009 and 2010 gina prohibits discrimination based on genetic information in health coverage title i and employment title ii under gina health plans are not permitted to use or disclose genetic information for underwriting purposes which includes eligibility determinations they also may not collect genetic information such as by requiring genetic testing except in very limited circumstances 

  

in march 2012 the ftc issued a final report setting forth best practices for businesses to protect the privacy of consumers and to give them greater control over the collection and use of pii in this report the ftc recommends that companies handling consumer data implement measures to increase the security of pii to enable consumers to choose how their pii is shared and to promote transparency 

  

  

about how pii is collected and used the report also recommends that congress enact additional privacyrelated legislation even though it has not yet done so 

  

reimbursement  a significant portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state reimbursement laws and regulatory requirements antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws see the “selfreferral laws” section below for explanation of the stark law sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs as well as employers and other entities that qualify for the medicare part d drug subsidy andor the early retiree reinsurance program created under aca some of these federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on our pbm and our retail pharmacies to coordinate benefits among private health plans and governmentsponsored health care programs when a customer or plan member has benefits coverage through more than one insurance company or other payor in addition our pbm has contractual agreements to process on behalf of pbm clients reimbursement claims submitted by or on behalf of federal and state government agencies following payment by the government agencies of claims that should have been submitted by members to private health plans as the primary source of benefits coverage these claims are commonly known as “pay and chase” claims and we and our pbm clients are subject to federal and state laws and regulations impacting how these claims are processed and reimbursed see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark in conjunction with a class action settlement implemented in september 2009 involving first databank “fdb” and medispan two entities that publish the awp of pharmaceuticals the methodology used to calculate awp was modified in a manner that reduced awp for many brand drugs and some generic drugs we have reached understandings with most of our pbm clients and other third party payors to adjust reimbursements to account for this change in methodology but most state medicaid programs that utilize awp as a pricing reference have not taken action to make similar adjustments as a result we have experienced reduced medicaid reimbursement for certain products since the settlement was implemented in addition fdb discontinued the publishing of awp in september 2011 although medispan continues to publish awp it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp we will continue to work with our pbm clients and other payors to anticipate and mitigate the impact of possible future changes to applicable references for pricing pharmaceuticals awp has already been replaced by average sales price “asp” as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b 

  

the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs investigations have commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether the best price available to essentially any client other than the medicaid program or “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers aca increased the amount of rebates required to be paid by manufacturers under the medicaid program and also imposes certain annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers we do not anticipate the increased medicaid rebate levels or the annual fees to impact the discounts we obtain from pharmaceutical companies 

  

aca made several other significant changes to the medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these was to revise the definition of average manufacturer price “amp” and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs which is based on federal upper limits “ful” established by cms in february 2012 cms issued a proposed rule to interpret and implement these changes cms is proposing to set the ful for multisource drug reimbursement at 175 of amp the ful would be established for each multisource drug for which the fda has rated three or more products therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent and would be based on the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly amps for such products among other things the proposed cms rule also proposes changes to medicaid drug reimbursement payment methodologies and to medicaid best price regulations it is uncertain as to what extent these proposed changes may impact medicaid reimbursement rates cms has stated that it intends to issue a final rule in 2013 because of the proposed status of the rule we cannot yet predict the impact of the proposed rule on the company cms issued and solicited comments on a draft ampbased ful and draft threemonth rolling average ful files and has stated that after it considers comments on these draft files and certain other draft drug pricing it will release these data files in final form and post updated files on at least a monthly basis these finalized files may then be used by states depending on the 

  

  

approved state plan to develop a pharmacy reimbursement methodology that will allow their pharmacy payments to remain within the ful in the aggregate cms has not provided guidance on when the final ful will be published 

  

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor and some states have enacted legislation and regulations impacting the definition of a pharmacy’s “usual and customary” price uc including whether pricing offered by pharmacies pursuant to discount card or similar programs should be considered in determining uc these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

  

changes in reporting of awp amp asp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors andor could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail and mail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

  

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us congress then expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new or pending health legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

  

retail clinics  states regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics 

  

retiree drug subsidy  the mma created a drug subsidy program available to certain employer union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to medicare part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to medicare part d coverage the subsidy is equal to 28 of drug costs and is currently taxfree however for plan years beginning in 2013 aca eliminates the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans this may cause some employers to transition their retirees to employersponsored medicare part d plans 

  

safety regulations  the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated under osha and various record keeping reporting and procedural requirements many of these osha standards as well as various state and local laws and regulations pertaining to employee safety and health including some that apply specifically to healthcare employees apply to our operations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

  

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid 

  

  

program exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

  

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

  

state insurance laws  feeforservice pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

  

during 2012 the company offered pdps through its silverscript and pennsylvania life insurance subsidiaries these insurance subsidiaries each must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under applicable state laws or they must have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms each of these subsidiaries is licensed in all states in which they offer pdps and do not operate under any medicare part d waivers as licensed insurance companies they are subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial licensing and operational reports pursuant to the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps but the application of other state laws to medicare part d is generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

  

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our clients or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

  

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that supplement medicare part d payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner medicare part d plans are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps with state authorization have also received permission from cms to enroll members who do not choose their own medicare part d plans into pdps 

  

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails these laws may among other things impose registration requirements require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when where and how consumers may be contacted require consumer consent prior to being contacted require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services require the establishment of certain policies and training of personnel and require the retention of specific business records 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

  

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the fca contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable 

  

  

federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

  

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns these changes could affect drug utilization trends as well as the financial health and number of covered lives of our pbm clients resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

although a recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms 

  

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

  

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by the company’s efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this dynamic may enhance 

  

  

the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish the ability of the company to negotiate reduced acquisition costs 

  

in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices 

  

aca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of amp and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs in february 2012 cms issued a proposed rule to interpret and implement these changes among other things the proposed cms rule also proposes changes to medicaid drug reimbursement payment methodologies and to medicaid best price regulations and the extent to which these proposed changes may impact medicaid reimbursement rates remains uncertain cms has stated that it intends to issue a final rule in 2013 because of the proposed status of the rule we cannot yet predict its impact on the company in addition aca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum mlr to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these aca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

  

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business 

  

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract therefore we face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing pbm business none of our pbm clients represented more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2012 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms 

  

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

  

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents 

  

risks relating to the market availability suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell 

  

we dispense significant volumes of brandname and generic drugs from our retail and mailorder pharmacies and through our network of retail pharmacies when increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing or other supply issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs occur physicians may cease writing prescriptions for these drugs or the utilization of these drugs may be otherwise reduced additionally adverse publicity regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs on occasion products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to overthecounter products which can result in changes in prescription utilization in addition future fda rulings could restrict the supply or increase the cost of products sold to our customers our volumes net revenues profitability and cash flows may decline as a result of such market changes 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

  

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused the company’s pbm and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive our retail pharmacy segment has also been impacted by the margin pressures described above 

  

  

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

  

since its inception in 2006 medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of medicare part d and as a result of the expected elimination in 2013 of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes sanctions or other restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measures sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable sanctions or other restrictions that may be imposed by cms if we fail to effectively integrate and operate the medicare part d businesses we have acquired or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be impacted 

  

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks 

  

implementation of the fdb and medispan settlements described in the government regulation section have resulted in changes in the methodology used to calculate awp which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors following these settlements fdb discontinued the publishing of awp in september 2011 although medispan continues to publish awp it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

  

an extremely competitive business environment 

  

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pharmacy services business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment our competitive success is impacted by the ability of our retail pharmacy business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms and by the ability of our pharmacy services business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies in an environment where some pbm clients are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks 

  

as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business andor an increase in participation in our maintenance choice program in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future 

  

competitors in the pbm industry eg express scripts catamaran optumrx and prime therapeutics include large national pbm companies pbms owned by large national health plans and smaller standalone pbms some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future 

  

  

reform of the us health care system 

  

congressional efforts to reform the us health care system finally came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of aca which is resulting in significant structural changes to the health insurance system many of the structural changes enacted by aca are not scheduled to be implemented until 2014 and many of the applicable regulations and subregulatory guidance have not yet been issued andor finalized therefore there is considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of aca on our business while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices the company cannot predict what effect if any the aca changes may have on its retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses and it is possible that other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that the company cannot anticipate could also occur 

  

the failure to properly maintain our information technology systems our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information 

  

many aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected processed stored and handled by these systems throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including personal information that our customers and clients provide to purchase products or services enroll in programs or services register on our websites interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us in addition for these operations we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches vandalism catastrophic events and human error although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect confidential information against security breaches a compromise of our information security controls or those of businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties if our information systems are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claims adjudication platforms we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical information customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions in addition compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes

we make recommendations to our clients encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug we believe that we help our clients control costs by recommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our clients also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists 

  

formulary management  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for members and clients we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug lists and generic equivalent products as well as our clinical programs many of our clients choose to adopt our drug lists as part of their plan design 

  

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to clients that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for volume discounts andor the payment by the pharmaceutical companies of retroactive discounts or rebates from established list prices for certain products that are purchased by our pharmacies we receive discounts at the time of purchase andor discounts for prompt payment of invoices we also receive various purchase discounts under our wholesale contracts which may include retroactive discounts or rebates if we exceed contractuallydefined purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues

retail pharmacy network management  we maintain a national network of approximately 65000 retail pharmacies including cvspharmacy stores when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility while also performing a drug utilization review to evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

  

prescription management systems  we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail service or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating review of various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

  

clinical services  we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote safety and to target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact members’ health and the client’s pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management quality assurance adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies

pharmacy services information systems  we currently operate multiple information systems platforms to support our pharmacy services segment these information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other pbm clients’ service contracts as part of our streamlining initiative we are consolidating our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced capabilities 

  

pharmacy services clients  our clients are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans employers unions government employee groups insurance companies and managed care organizations and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems among other things to perform safety checks drug interaction screening and generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients no single pbm client accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues in 2011 our client agreements are subject to renegotiation of terms see “risk factors — efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices” and “ risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry” during the year ended december 31 2011 our pbm filled or managed approximately 775 million prescriptions 

  

seasonality  the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature 

  

  

pharmacy services competition  we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members the pharmacy services segment competes with a number of large national pbm companies including express scripts inc “esi” and medco health solutions inc “medco” as well as many smaller local or regional pbms in 2011 esi and medco announced plans to merge their businesses subject to various closing conditions and regulatory approvals it remains unclear whether the merger will be completed we also compete with several large health insurersmanaged care plans eg united healthcare and cigna which have their own pbm capabilities as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours 

  

retail pharmacy segment 

  

as of december 31 2011 the retail pharmacy segment included 7327 retail drugstores of which 7271 operated a pharmacy our online retail pharmacy website cvscom 30 onsite pharmacy stores and our retail health care clinics the retail drugstores are located in 41 states puerto rico and the district of columbia operating primarily under the cvspharmacy ® name we currently operate in 92 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 73 of these markets cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise which we refer to as “front store” products existing retail stores range in size from approximately 5000 to 25000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 8000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during 2011 we filled approximately 658 million retail prescriptions or approximately 20 of the us retail pharmacy market 

  

as of december 31 2011 we operated 657 retail health care clinics in 25 states and the district of columbia under the minuteclinic ® name of which 648 were located within cvspharmacy stores 

  

retail pharmacy business strategy  our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and more cost effective drug therapies in addition we seek to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our strategy is to have convenientlylocated stores many of which are open extended —hours or 24hours per day and to offer drivethrough pharmacy services where practicable we also provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

  

retail pharmacy products and services  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business 

  

  

consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows 

  

   

1   percentages are estimates based on store pointofsale data 

  

pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2011 2010 and 2009 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the impact of health care reform the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products medicare part d and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program our customer savings initiative which educates customers about cost savings opportunities maintenance choice a flexible fulfillment option that affords eligible pbm plan members the convenient choice of filling their 90day supply of maintenance medications at any cvspharmacy store or obtaining them through mail order in either case at the cost of mail which is typically lower for both the plan member and payor pharmacy advisor our program that uses our consumer engagement engine technology to facilitate pharmacist counseling both facetoface and over the telephone to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions and the extracare health card program further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  and our online business cvscom 

  

front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states in addition the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvspharmacy ® and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvspharmacy stores we currently carry over 4400 cvspharmacy and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 18 of our front store revenues during 2011 furthermore we are tailoring certain groups of stores to better meet the needs of our customers such as our urban cluster stores 

  

  

minuteclinic  as of december 31 2011 we operated 657 minuteclinic ® locations in 25 states and the district of columbia of which 648 were located in cvspharmacy stores minuteclinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions perform health screenings monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations many locations have also begun treating a variety of chronic conditions insurers value minuteclinic because it provides convenient highquality costeffective care in many cases offering an attractive alternative to the far more expensive emergency room as a result visits paid for by employers health insurers or other third parties accounted for approximately 84 of minuteclinic’s total revenues in 2011 we anticipate opening up approximately 100 new clinics in cvspharmacy stores during 2012 minuteclinic is collaborating with our pharmacy services segment to help meet the needs of cvs caremark plan members by offering programs that can improve member health and lower costs 

  

onsite pharmacies  we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites under the careplus cvspharmacy ®  careplus tm or cvspharmacy ® name which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

  

retail pharmacy store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2011 we opened 161 new retail pharmacy stores relocated 86 stores and closed 16 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1400 new and relocated stores and acquired approximately 500 stores during 2012 we expect to open between 225 and 250 new or relocated stores and close approximately 20 stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

  

retail pharmacy information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency in 2010 we completed the rollout of rx connect which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions our consumer engagement engine technology enables us to message pharmacists at the point of care which facilitates facetoface counseling regarding patient health and safety matters including adherence issues gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chainwide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone we continue to enhance our visible improvement in profits execution and results “viper” system a transactionmonitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to transactions processed through our pointofsale systems in addition we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking 

  

retail pharmacy customers  managed care organizations governmentfunded health care programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 978 of our 2011 pharmacy revenues the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single retail payor accounts for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues however the success of our retail drugstore business is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms in 2011 two of the nation’s largest pbms medco and esi together accounted for approximately 22 of our retail pharmacy segment revenues during 2011 medco and esi announced plans to merge their businesses subject to various closing conditions and regulatory approvals it remains unclear whether the merger will occur and we cannot predict the impact of the proposed merger if completed on the competitive landscape see item 1a “risk factors — an extremely competitive business environment ” our contracts with commercial payors and governmentfunded programs are subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates see “government regulation — reimbursement” and item 1a “risk factors — efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices ”

government regulation 

  

overview  as a participant in the health care industry our retail and pharmacy services businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern the purchase sale and distribution of prescription drugs and related services including administration and management of prescription drug benefits many of our pbm clients including insurers and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted we are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or any adverse applications of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results andor financial condition 

  

  

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds state laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs the federal antiremuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts the office of inspector general the “oig” within the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and administrative bodies a broad interpretation of the federal antiremuneration law is supported by the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “ppaca” which codified a reduced standard of “knowingly and willfully” by stating that this standard does not require that a person have actual knowledge of the federal antiremuneration law or specific intent to violate this law ppaca also provides that a violation of the federal antiremuneration law constitutes a false or fraudulent act under the federal false claims act “fca” because of the federal statute’s broad scope hhs established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers certain personal services arrangements certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians and certain other transactions and relationships a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by hhs in addition as part of ppaca additional statutory exceptions have been created to permit the provision of certain incentives to federal health care program beneficiaries including retailer coupons rebates or other rewards and incentives offered to promote access to care also waivers have been granted by the oig and cms to allow affordable care organization “aco” providers to give certain free items and services to beneficiaries that encourage adherence to clinical goals such as a drug regimen as long as such items or services do not encourage the beneficiary to seek care from an aco provider see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

antitrust and unfair competition  the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” relief under the ftca can encompass equitable relief and consumer redress in addition numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms and retail pharmacies to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

compliance programs  ppaca requires that health care providers enrolled in medicare and medicaid must establish and maintain compliance programs that satisfy core requirements to be established by the secretary of hhs in consultation with the oig the secretary of hhs has not yet published information concerning these compliance programs or the timeframe for implementation in addition certain state government health care programs have compliance program requirements and we are subject to various government agreements described under “government agreements” below that also contain requirements relating to the maintenance of compliance programs 

  

consumer protection laws  the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services and financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs in addition the ftca bars unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce the federal postal service act generally prohibits the mailing of and billing for unordered merchandise the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule also imposes extensive requirements and restrictions in connection with telemarketing of plans or programs that encourage the purchase of goods or services by consumers see the telemarketing and other outbound contacts section below for further disclosures 

  

  

contract audits  we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our pharmacy provider agreements and our contracts relating to medicare part d audits are typically conducted pursuant to certain provisions in our pbm contracts and provider agreements that grant audit rights and set forth applicable audit procedures because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate medicaid fee for service plans managed medicaid plans medicare part d plans or medicare advantage organizations the audits generally focus on among other things compliance with the applicable terms of our contracts and applicable legal requirements 

  

disease management services regulation  we provide or arrange for pbm plan members to receive clinical services in the form of disease management programs for common and rare medical conditions nurses pharmacists and other clinicians as needed develop and implement these programs state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing and clinicians engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

  

electronic prescribing  the federal government has implemented different programs to promote electronic prescribing including the erx incentive program established under the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 which provides a combination of incentive payments and payment adjustments through 2014 to eligible professionals who are successful electronic prescribers while this program sunsets after 2014 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” established an incentive program for eligible professionals and hospitals participating in the medicare or medicaid program that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health records “ehr” technology beginning in 2011 arra also provides for downward payment adjustments beginning in 2015 for eligible professionals in the medicare program that fail to adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr technology such as electronic prescribing a final rule implementing the ehr incentive program was issued in july 2010 which requires that at least 40 of permissible prescriptions be sent electronically in order to qualify for the incentive payments in march 2010 the us drug enforcement administration “dea” issued an interim final rule allowing electronic prescribing of controlled substances beginning june 1 2010 these changes together with the requirement for medicare part d plans to support electronic prescribing should result in a growing number of prescribers adopting electronic prescribing 

  

environmental regulation  our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities there is also an increased interest by regulators in better managing photo processing as well as pharmaceutical and other wastes our retail pharmacies have been subject to various state environmental agency enforcement actions and we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies 

  

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

  

  

erisa fiduciaries may be held personally liable for entering into service contracts or arrangements like pbm contracts on behalf of erisa plans if the terms of the contract are not reasonable or if the service provider receives more than reasonable compensation for the services provided in such cases the service provider may also be required to disgorge any unreasonable compensation received and may be subject to civil penalties imposed by the us department of labor “dol” 

  

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received these provisions of erisa are similar but not identical to the health care antiremuneration statutes discussed above although erisa lacks the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions incorporated into the health care statutes similar to these health care statutes the corresponding provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain 

  

most pension and welfare plans subject to erisa are required to report to the dol compensation paid to service providers in addition the dol announced a project in 2009 to promulgate regulations under erisa that could require service providers including pbms to provide detailed disclosure regarding all direct and indirect compensation to be received in connection with the services provided as well as potential conflicts of interest the dol issued supplemental “frequently asked questions” in 2010 that specifically addressed pbm disclosure of certain compensation including i fees for services such as dispensing fees and administrative fees which are reportable as direct compensation and ii discounts and rebates received by pbms from pharmaceutical companies which pending further guidance from the dol generally do not need to be treated as reportable indirect compensation further guidance is expected from the dol and we cannot be certain of the extent to which possible future disclosure regulations may impact our business 

  

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

  

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the fca which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 “fera” implemented substantial changes to the fca which expand the scope of fca liability provide for new investigative tools and make it easier for qui tam relators often referred to as “whistleblowers” to bring and maintain fca suits on behalf of the government ppaca further eased the burden for whistleblowers to bring and maintain fca suits by modifying the “public disclosure” and “original source” provisions of the fca some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws fera also expanded the fca to cover improperly avoiding an obligation to pay money to the government and ppaca clarified that the retention of overpayments beyond the repayment deadline is a violation of the fca in addition ppaca provides that a violation of the federal antiremuneration law constitutes a false or fraudulent act under the fca and expands the jurisdiction of the fca to the health insurance exchanges to be created under ppaca ppaca also provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made any false or fraudulent record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment under a governmentsponsored program for knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment and for false statements in provider enrollment applications the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section in recent years federal and state government authorities have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws and they have conducted numerous investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

  

fda regulation  the united states food and drug administration “fda” generally has authority to regulate drugs drug classifications and drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer the fda also has the regulatory authority over many of the products sold through retail pharmacies including certain food items cosmetics dietary supplements and otc medications we previously operated a fdaregulated repackaging facility where we repackaged certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies but we closed this repackaging facility in april 2010 the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs or other fdaregulated products as well as procedures to comply with food safety regulations in addition the fda has authority to require the submission and implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy “rems” if the fda determines that that a rems is necessary for the safe and effective marketing of a drug to the extent we dispense products subject to rems requirements or provide rems services to pharmaceutical manufacturers we are subject to audit by the fda and the pharmaceutical manufacturer the fda also has regulatory authority over medical devices such as otc genetic tests and genetic tests conducted by medical laboratories and the fda continues to evaluate the need for further regulation of such tests 

  

federal employee health benefits program  we have a contractual arrangement with the bluecross blueshield association “bcbsa” to provide pharmacy services to federal employees postal workers annuitants and their dependents under the governmentwide service benefit plan as authorized by the federal employees health benefits act “fehba” and as part of the federal employees health benefits program “fehbp” this arrangement subjects us to fehba fehba regulations including the federal employees health benefits acquisition regulation the office of personnel management guidelines and certain federal acquisition regulations these laws regulations and guidelines govern the process by which the federal government contracts with health insurance carriers such as bcbsa that participate in the fehbp and obligate such health insurance carriers to impose various contractual requirements on their contract vendors including among other things requirements relating to transparency performance standards drug interchanges patient safety consumer access coordination of benefits pricing adjustments recordkeeping and audits 

  

formulary regulation  a number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of medicare part d in july 2008 congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act which requires the secretary for hhs to identify certain classes and categories of drugs for which subject to certain exceptions all the drugs in any such class or category must be included in a medicare part d plan’s formulary the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients 

  

government agreements  our pbm business is subject to the terms of a 2008 consent order entered into with a number of states impacting certain of our pbm business practices including matters relating to our relationships with clients pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies plan members prescribers and pharmacists 

  

in march 2008 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government and a number of states related to the dispensing of the generic drug ranitidine at its retail pharmacies at the same time the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig for a period of five years applicable to certain retail and mail service operations of the company this 2008 corporate integrity agreement requires among other things maintenance of our compliance program employee training specific reviews by an independent review organization and various government reporting obligations in april 2011 we entered into an amendment of the corporate integrity agreement in connection with the previously announced settlement of a federal and state government investigation of certain retail pharmacy billing practices with respect to “dual eligible” customers having both medicaid coverage and other thirdparty insurance coverage this amendment requires the company to comply with the corporate integrity agreement as amended for a period of three years and further requires among other things additional employee training obligations additional reporting obligations and periodic medicaid billing reviews by an independent review organization failure to meet our obligations under this corporate integrity agreement as amended could result in stipulated financial penalties and failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our applicable business from participation in federal health care programs 

  

in january 2009 we entered into separate settlement agreements with the ftc and the hhs office for civil rights “ocr” resolving a joint investigation prompted by 2006 media reports of disposal of patient information in dumpsters at a limited number of cvspharmacy locations as part of the ftc settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate enterprisewide information security policies and procedures during the twentyyear term of the agreement the ftc settlement also provides for periodic compliance 

  

  

monitoring by an external assessor as part of the ocr settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate waste disposal policies and procedures training and employee sanctions at our retail stores the ocr settlement has a threeyear term and provides for annual compliance monitoring by an external assessor 

  

in october 2010 the company entered into a nonprosecution agreement and civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice “doj” and various united states attorneys’ offices relating to the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine products at certain cvspharmacy stores primarily in california and nevada the company also entered into a related memorandum of agreement with the dea the nonprosecution agreement and the memorandum of agreement contain certain ongoing compliance requirements for the company and failure to comply with the terms of these documents could lead to civil or criminal remedies financial penalties andor administrative remedies against the dea registrations for our retail pharmacies and distribution centers 

  

in january 2012 the company announced an agreement with the ftc to enter into a proposed consent order that would prohibit the company from misrepresenting the prices or costs of medicare part d prescription drugs or other prices or costs associated with medicare part d prescription drug plans this proposed consent order has been accepted by the ftc for public comment and remains subject to final approval 

  

in addition to the government agreements described above the company andor its various affiliates are subject to other consent decrees or settlement agreements with various federal state and local authorities that may contain certain ongoing reporting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company these agreements relate to such matters as privacy practices waste disposal practices selling expired products environmental and safety matters tobacco sales marketing and advertising practices pharmacy operations and various other business practices 

  

health reform legislation  congress passed major health reform legislation in 2010 known as ppaca this legislation affects the entire health insurance system and virtually every aspect of health care in the country although many provisions of ppaca were not effective immediately given that many of the regulations implementing ppaca are still being finalized and that ongoing subregulatory guidance is still being issued there is considerable uncertainty as to its full impact further aspects of the legislation are being challenged in lawsuits across the country and some in congress are seeking to repeal the law or portions of it there have already been a number of conflicting court rulings calling into question the constitutionality of all or certain portions of ppaca and additional judicial review including review by the united states supreme court is expected in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage beginning in 2014 ppaca enacted a number of significant health care reforms while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices 

  

among the more significant ppaca provisions is the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees the mlr requires insurers to break out clinical quality improvement and administrative costs hhs issued an interim final regulation on the mlr in december 2010 that includes an example that could be interpreted to suggest that the differential between the drug price charged by pbms to health plans and the amount reimbursed to retail pharmacies commonly referred to as “differential” or “spread” should be excluded from claims costs subsequent subregulatory guidance remained consistent with this interpretation although it made clear that clinical services performed by a pbm could be included in claims costs health plan clients that are subject to the mlr requirements may request pricing modifications include requests to contract with our pbm using passthrough retail network pricing 

  

another ppaca provision requires pbms that contract with a medicare part d plan or a qualified health plan offered through a health insurance exchange to disclose certain information to hhs the medicare part d plan or the health insurance exchange among the information that must be disclosed is the generic dispensing rate for different types of pharmacies the aggregate amount and types of rebates and other discounts negotiated on behalf of and passed through to the plan and the aggregate amount of any differential although some of these items such as differential were required to be reported for part d in 2011 per cms guidance the full reporting will be required for medicare part d upon the issuance of a final rule implementing the requirements which is expected in 2012 and for qualified health plans in 2014 upon the implementation of the health insurance exchanges to be established under ppaca ppaca also increases the obligations of part d plan sponsors to report rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to enable calculation of new annual fees being imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers related to branded drug sales ppaca also made significant changes to the medicare and medicaid programs fraud and abuse laws and tax provisions some of which are discussed elsewhere in this government regulation section 

  

managed care reform  in addition to health reforms enacted by ppaca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals 

  

  

considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

  

medicare part d  the mma created medicare part d the medicare drug benefit program in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for drug coverage under medicare part d regulations implementing medicare part d included requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks marketing of medicare part d plans processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception including changes made by ppaca effective for the 2010 plan year cms issued a regulation requiring that any “differential” or “spread” be reported as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost of the plan sponsor for purposes of calculating certain government subsidy payments and the drug price to be charged to enrollees this change resulted in medicare part d plan sponsors contracting for passthrough pricing for their retail networks rather than pricing that included the use of retail network “differential” or “spread” 

  

ppaca expanded the medicare part d benefit effective for the 2011 plan year by implementing the coverage gap discount program under which participating manufacturers fund discounts of 50 on brand drugs obtained during the coverage gap or “donut hole” and starting the phaseout of the coverage gap for generic drugs which is to be completed by 2020 

  

ppaca also requires the secretary of hhs to develop rules for shorter dispensing periods for enrollees in longterm care facilities in order to reduce waste several of the ppaca changes will require significant adjudication and reporting systems modifications in october 2011 cms issued a proposed rule on part d that among other things would establish a daily cost sharing rate as a form of drug utilization management and certain fraud waste and abuse controls the proposed rule also permits cms to terminate a part d sponsor’s contract if it performs poorly against cms performance criteria known as “star ratings” for three consecutive years 

  

medicare part d continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

  

mental health parity legislation  the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 and its implementing regulations require group health plans that provide both medicalsurgical benefits and mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits to ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations that apply to the mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits are no more restrictive than those that apply to the medicalsurgical benefits while the implementing regulations contain a special rule allowing for “multitiered prescription drug benefits” that meet certain conditions there is considerable uncertainty regarding the application of this rule this has caused some group health plans to consider dropping mental health benefits including drugs that treat these conditions to avoid being found in violation of the regulation 

  

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in medicare part d and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d sponsor for each type of pharmacy in its network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our clients or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm clients such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

  

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may i prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network andor ii impact how we conduct audits of network pharmacies and recover audit discrepancies except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment or other pricing differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail network pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

  

pbm laws and regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to clients and plan members ii require pbms to disclose andor remit to clients or their plan members certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to clients and their plan members andor v impose licensing or registration requirements to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their 

  

  

enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

  

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the naic have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as the national committee for quality assurance and the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities for example urac has issued pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark is currently accredited as a pbm by urac while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

  

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment 

  

pharmacy and professional licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substance and listed chemical products and medical and controlled substance waste disposal federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and some state regulations require compliance with standards established by the united states pharmacopeia with respect to the packaging storing and shipping of pharmaceuticals federal and state controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and distribution centers with the dea and state controlled substances agencies and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control personnel and labeling standards in order to possess and dispense controlled substances and listed chemical products 

  

we also are subject to regulation by the dea and state pharmacy boards in connection with our online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods numerous state laws also exist affecting our receipt and processing of electronic prescription drug orders 

  

certain violations of the federal controlled substances laws can subject the company its pharmacies and distribution centers and individual pharmacy personnel to criminal and civil penalties and can also result in administrative action by the dea including suspension or revocation of a pharmacy’s or distribution center’s registration to distribute controlled substances andor listed chemical products state authorities and state boards of pharmacy similarly have the authority to impose both monetary penalties and disciplinary sanctions including revocation of a pharmacy’s or individual pharmacist’s license to dispense controlled substances and these penalties and sanctions are in addition to sanctions imposed under the federal controlled substances laws certain violations of these federal and state legal requirements can also trigger other consequences for the company’s business and could potentially impact our eligibility to participate in federal health care programs 

  

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the ftc requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service and the department of transportation each has regulatory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail or in commerce and state licensing authorities may restrict the types of personnel who may work in mail service operations 

  

our pharmacists technicians and certain other health care professionals are subject to state regulation of their profession and our employees who are engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing or registration requirements and comply with applicable professional standards in addition they must comply with any applicable federal or state requirements for participation in governmentsponsored health care programs failure to comply with these requirements could subject us and our employees to disciplinary action including fines penalties or sanctions could impact our ability to obtain or retain reimbursement for services provided to participants of governmentsponsored health care programs andor could cause our licenses and permits and our employees’ licenses to be suspended or revoked 

  

  

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan member may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic interchange requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and ppaca requires the coverage of certain preventive services at no cost sharing such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our clients generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies or for use of certain health care providers legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our clients and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

  

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy protections and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” hipaa also gives individuals certain rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain the individual’s written authorization criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

  

during 2011 ocr continued to promulgate new and updated nonfinal regulations in response to the 2010 health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” as part of arra which contained significant legislative changes to the hipaa privacy and security rules these changes included restrictions on the use of phi without an individual’s written authorization a requirement to account for routine disclosures of phi held in an electronic health record a requirement to notify individuals of breaches to their phi enforcement rights of state attorneys general extension of the federal privacy and security law provisions and penalties to business associates of covered entities and increased penalties for violation of the law while some of the provisions of the hitech act are already in effect final regulations regarding the hipaa privacy security enforcement and data breach rules are yet to be issued in may 2011 hhs published a notice of proposed rulemaking “nprm” to address changes to the requirements surrounding the accounting of disclosures that included a new requirement that a hipaacovered entity report to an individual all internal uses and disclosures of electronic phi if hhs adopts the nprm as currently written it could generate substantial burdens and costs for the company and our business associates to implement fully nevertheless since the rules implementing this proposal and much of the hitech act have not yet been finalized we cannot at this time determine the extent to which these changes may apply to or impact our business 

  

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa most states have also enacted legislation and regulations governing the security of pii and specifying notification requirements for any security breaches involving pii 

  

in addition to hipaa and hitech the genetic information nondiscrimination act “gina” was signed into law in may 2008 and proposed and interim final regulations were issued under it in 2009 and 2010 gina prohibits discrimination based on genetic information in health coverage title i and employment title ii under gina health plans are not permitted to use or disclose genetic information for underwriting purposes which includes eligibility determinations they also may not collect genetic information such as by requiring genetic testing except in very limited circumstances 

  

reimbursement  a significant portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state reimbursement laws and regulatory requirements antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs as well as employers and other entities that qualify for the medicare part d drug subsidy andor the early retiree reinsurance program created under ppaca some of these federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on our pbm and our retail pharmacies to coordinate benefits among private health plans and 

  

  

governmentsponsored health care programs when a customer or plan member has benefits coverage through more than one insurance company or other payor in addition our pbm has contractual agreements to process on behalf of pbm clients reimbursement claims submitted by or on behalf of federal and state government agencies following payment by the government agencies of claims that should have been submitted by members to private health plans as the primary source of benefits coverage these claims are commonly known as “pay and chase” claims and we and our pbm clients are subject to federal and state laws and regulations impacting how these claims are processed and reimbursed see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark in conjunction with a class action settlement implemented in september 2009 involving first databank “fdb” and medispan two entities that publish the awp of pharmaceuticals the methodology used to calculate awp was modified in a manner that reduced awp for many brand drugs and some generic drugs we have reached understandings with most of our pbm clients and other third party payors to adjust reimbursements to account for this change in methodology but most state medicaid programs that utilize awp as a pricing reference have not taken action to make similar adjustments as a result we have experienced reduced medicaid reimbursement for certain products since the settlement was implemented in addition fdb discontinued the publishing of awp in september 2011 although medispan continues to publish awp it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp we will continue to work with our pbm clients and other payors to anticipate and mitigate the impact of possible future changes to applicable references for pricing pharmaceuticals awp has already been replaced by average sales price “asp” as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs investigations have commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether the best price available to essentially any client other than the medicaid program or “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers ppaca increased the amount of rebates required to be paid by manufacturers under the medicaid program and also imposes certain annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers we do not anticipate the increased medicaid rebate levels or the annual fees to impact the discounts we obtain from pharmaceutical companies 

  

ppaca made several other significant changes to the medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these was to revise the definition of average manufacturer price “amp” and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs which is based on federal upper limits “ful” established by cms on january 27 2012 cms released a proposed rule to interpret and implement these changes cms is proposing to set the ful for multisource drug reimbursement at 175 of amp the ful would be established for each multisource drug for which the fda has rated three or more products therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent and would be based on the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly amps for such products among other things the proposed cms rule also proposes changes to medicaid drug reimbursement payment methodologies and to medicaid best price regulations it is uncertain as to what extent these proposed changes may impact medicaid reimbursement rates cms is seeking comments on the proposed rule through april 2 2012 and has stated that it intends to issue a final rule in 2013 because of the proposed status of the rule we cannot yet predict the impact of the proposed rule on the company cms has also issued a “draft affordable care act ful methodology and data elements guide” together with draft files of fuls cms is seeking comment prior to publishing the final fuls the final fuls will take effect without regard to whether or not final regulations have been promulgated cms has not provided guidance on when the final fuls will be published 

  

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor and some states have enacted legislation and regulations impacting the definition of a pharmacy’s “usual and customary” price uc including whether pricing offered by pharmacies pursuant to discount card or similar programs should be considered in determining uc these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

  

  

changes in reporting of awp amp asp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors andor could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail and mail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

  

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us congress then expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new or pending health legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

  

retail clinics  states also regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics 

  

retiree drug subsidy  the mma created a drug subsidy program available to certain employer union and other group plans that provides retiree coverage to medicare part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to medicare part d coverage the subsidy is equal to 28 of drug costs and is currently taxfree however for plan years beginning in 2013 ppaca eliminates the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans this may cause some employers to transition their retirees to employersponsored medicare part d plans as part of ppaca congress established a new temporary early retiree reinsurance program providing reimbursement to employer and union sponsors of participating employmentbased plans for a portion of the cost of health benefits for early retirees aged 55 to 64 and their spouses surviving spouses and dependents the program reimburses sponsors for certain claims between 15000 and 90000 congress appropriated funding of 5 billion for this temporary program which became effective june 1 2010 the program ends when the funding is exhausted but no later than january 1 2014 

  

safety regulation  the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated under osha and various record keeping reporting and procedural requirements many of these osha standards as well as various state and local laws and regulations pertaining to employee safety and health apply to our operations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities 

  

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid program exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

  

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

  

  

state insurance laws  feeforservice pdps and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guarantees or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

  

during 2011 the company offered pdps through its silverscript and accendo insurance subsidiaries and through pennsylvania life the insurance subsidiary acquired as part of the uam medicare part d business in april 2011 these insurance subsidiaries each must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under applicable state laws or they must have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms each of these subsidiaries is licensed in all states in which they offer pdps and do not operate under any medicare part d waivers as licensed insurance companies they are subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial licensing and operational reports pursuant to the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps but the application of other state laws to medicare part d is generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

  

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our clients or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

  

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that supplement medicare part d payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner medicare part d plans are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps with state authorization have also received permission from cms to enroll members who do not choose their own medicare part d plans into pdps 

  

telemarketing and other outbound contacts  certain federal and state laws give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls texts or emails these laws may among other things impose registration requirements require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when where and how consumers may be contacted require consumer consent prior to being contacted require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services require the establishment of certain policies and training of personnel and require the retention of specific business records 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

  

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the fca contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance 

  

we can give no assurance however that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or to the health care industry generally iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or of the health care industry generally iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services retail pharmacy or retail clinic industry or the health care industry generally

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factors and by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve 

  

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns these changes could affect drug utilization trends as well as the financial health and number of covered lives of our pbm clients resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

in that regard the economic recession resulted in declining drug utilization trends which continued in 2011 although a recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause further decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores further interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms 

  

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices 

  

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability has been mitigated by the company’s efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers however in recent years there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturer industry and it is possible that this dynamic may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish the ability of the company to negotiate reduced acquisition costs 

  

  

in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices 

  

ppaca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and to reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of amp and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs cms has recently issued a proposed rule to interpret and implement these changes and the proposed rule also proposes changes to medicaid drug reimbursement payment methodologies and to medicaid best price regulations cms is seeking comments on the proposed rule through april 2 2012 and has stated that it intends to issue a final rule in 2013 because of the proposed status of the rule we cannot yet predict its impact on the company in addition ppaca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum mlr to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these ppaca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

  

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business 

  

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract therefore we face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing pbm business none of our pbm clients represented more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2011 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms 

  

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

  

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly our business could be impacted by a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

  

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused caremark and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive 

  

  

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d 

  

since its inception in 2006 medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of medicare part d and as a result of the expected elimination in 2013 of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into medicare part d may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our medicare part d business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes sanctions or other restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions if we fail to effectively integrate and operate the medicare part d businesses we have acquired or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be impacted 

  

possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks 

  

implementation of the fdb and medispan settlements described in the government regulation section have resulted in changes in the methodology used to calculate awp which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors following these settlements fdb discontinued the publishing of awp in september 2011 although medispan continues to publish awp it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

  

an extremely competitive business environment 

  

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pbm business currently operates in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment our competitive success is impacted by the ability of our retail pharmacy business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pbms and other payors on acceptable terms and by the ability of our pbm business to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies on acceptable terms 

  

as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business andor an increase in participation in our maintenance choice program in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future 

  

competitors in the pbm industry include large national pbm companies such as medco and esi as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg united healthcare and cigna which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future in 2011 medco and esi announced plans to merge their businesses subject to various closing conditions and regulatory approvals it remains unclear whether the merger will occur and we cannot predict the impact of the proposed merger if completed on the competitive landscape 

  

  

reform of the us health care system 

  

congressional efforts to reform the us health care system finally came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of ppaca which will bring about the most significant structural changes to the health insurance system in decades while the bulk of the structural changes enacted by ppaca will not be implemented until 2014 and some of the key changes such as the individual mandate are already being challenged at the judicial and legislative levels it is expected that there will be increased government regulation and involvement in health care while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices the company cannot predict what effect if any the ppaca changes may have on its retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses and it is possible that other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that the company cannot anticipate could also occur

pharmacy services business strategy  our business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality client service in order to enhance clinical outcomes for our clients’ health benefit plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall healthcare costs we produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core pbm services including as described more fully below plan design and administration formulary management drug purchasing arrangements mail order services specialty pharmacy services retail pharmacy network management services medicare part d services and a broad array of clinical services 

in addition as a fully integrated pharmacy services company we are able to offer our clients and their plan members a variety of new programs and plan designs that benefit from our integrated information systems and the ability of our more than 25000 pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the many plan members who shop our stores every day through our multiple member touch points retail stores mail order and specialty pharmacies retail clinics call centers and proprietary websites we seek to engage plan members in behaviors that lower cost and improve healthcare outcomes examples of these programs and services include maintenance choice ®  a program where eligible members in plans sponsored by pharmacy services clients can elect to fill their maintenance prescriptions at our retail pharmacy stores instead of receiving them through the mail pharmacy advisor tm  a new program that uses our consumer engagement engine tm technology to facilitate facetoface counseling by our pharmacists to plan members of participating 

  

pbm clients concerning health and safety matters including adherence issues gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions new compliance and persistency programs designed to ensure that patients take their medications in the proper manner enhanced disease management programs that are targeted at managing chronic disease states and an extracare ® health card program which offers discounts to eligible plan members on certain overthecounter healthcare products sold in our cvspharmacy stores in addition we are working with our clients to i decrease unnecessary and expensive emergency room visits by encouraging plan members to use minuteclinic locations for everyday common ailments and ii create pilot programs that offer convenient unique services available at minuteclinic such as injection training for specialty pharmacy services 

while certain of these programs and services have already been adopted by many of our clients others are in the formative stage and require additional information system enhancements andor changes in work processes accordingly there can be no assurance as to timing or benefits associated with certain of these programs 

pbm services  the pbm services we provide for our clients involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the cost and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use these services are described more fully below 

plan design and administration  our clients sponsor pharmacy benefit plans that facilitate the ability of eligible members in these plans to receive medications prescribed by their physicians we assist our clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that minimize the costs to the client while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the clients’ members we also administer these benefit plans for our clients and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent informal communications as well as through a formal annual client review 

we make recommendations to our clients encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug we believe that we help our clients control costs by recommending plans that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our clients also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists 

formulary management  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for members and clients we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug lists and generic equivalent products as well as our clinical programs many of our clients choose to adopt our drug lists as part of their plan design 

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to clients that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for the payment by the pharmaceutical companies of retroactive discounts or rebates from established list prices for certain products that are purchased by our pharmacies we receive discounts at the time of purchase andor discounts for prompt payment of invoices we also receive various purchase discounts under our wholesale contracts which may include retroactive discounts or rebates if we exceed contractuallydefined purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues 

prescription management systems  we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail service or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed 

  

processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating review of various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

mail pharmacy program  as of december 31 2010 we operated four large automated mail service pharmacies in the continental united states plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refill requests primarily for maintenance medications to these pharmacies via mail telephone fax eprescribing or the internet we also operate a network of smaller mail service specialty pharmacies described below our staff pharmacists review mail service prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems this review may involve communications with the prescriber and with the prescriber’s approval can result in generic substitution therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to reduce cost and improve quality of treatment 

specialty pharmacy  our specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies as of december 31 2010 our specialty pharmacies were comprised of 18 specialty mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states and are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders substantially all of these pharmacies have been accredited by the joint commission which is an independent notforprofit organization that accredits and certifies more than 18000 health care organizations and programs in the united states as of december 31 2010 the company operated a network of 44 retail specialty pharmacy stores which operate under the careplus cvspharmacy name these stores average 2000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications homeopathic remedies and vitamins through our theracom subsidiary we provide new product launch and other services for manufacturers of specialty drugs 

onsite pharmacies  we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites under the careplus cvspharmacy or cvspharmacy name which provide members with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

retail pharmacy network  we maintain a national network of approximately 65000 retail pharmacies including cvspharmacy stores when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility while also performing a drug utilization review to evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

medicare part d services  we participate in the administration of the drug benefit added to the medicare program under part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” “medicare part d” through the provision of pbm services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as medicare part d prescription drug plans “pdp” we also participate i by offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits through our subsidiaries silverscript and accendo which have 

been approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” as pdps and ii by assisting employer union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility andor drug cost data to cms in order for them to obtain the subsidy in december 2010 the company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the medicare part d business of universal american corp “uac” for approximately 125 billion the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including necessary regulatory approvals as well as approval by uac shareholders the company currently expects that the transaction will close by the end of the second quarter of 2011 

clinical services  we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to promote safety and 

  

to target inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact members’ health and the client’s pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies 

disease management programs  our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties our accordantcare health management programs include integrated rare disease management programs which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis parkinson’s disease seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance “ncqa” a private notforprofit organization that evaluates accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations in addition we have entered into a strategic alliance with alere llc for the management of our common disease management program offerings which cover such chronic diseases as asthma diabetes congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease 

quality assurance  we have adopted and implemented clinical quality assurance procedures as well as policies and procedures to help ensure regulatory compliance under our quality assurance programs each new mail service prescription undergoes a sequence of safety and accuracy checks and is reviewed and verified by a registered pharmacist before shipment we also analyze drugrelated outcomes to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care 

pharmacogenomic services  in the fourth quarter of 2009 we acquired a majority interest in generation health inc a genetic benefit management company that will allow us to expand our offering of pharmacogenomic clinical and testing services to our pbm clients pharmacogenomics is the study of how genetic makeup affects an individual’s response to drug therapies through genetic testing doctors are able to evaluate a patient’s genetic makeup to determine the effectiveness of specific drugs drug dosages and drug combinations through this relationship we expect to use genetic testing to apply greater precision to client prescription management with the goal of improving individual health outcomes and reducing overall medical costs we began to offer these services on a limited pilot basis to clients during 2010 and plan to roll out these services to clients on a broader basis during 2011 

pharmacy services information systems  we currently operate multiple information systems platforms to support our pharmacy services segment these information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other pbm clients’ service contracts 

pharmacy services clients  our clients are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans employers unions government employee groups insurance companies and managed care organizations and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems among other things to perform safety checks drug interaction screening and generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients no single pbm client accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2010 our client agreements are subject to renegotiation of terms see “risk factors – efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our business” and “ risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry” during the year ended december 31 2010 our pbm filled or managed approximately 585 million prescriptions 

seasonality  the majority of our pharmacy services segment revenues are not seasonal in nature 

pharmacy services competition  we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts 

  

from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members the pharmacy services segment competes with a number of large national pbm companies including medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many smaller local or regional pbms we also compete with several large health insurersmanaged care plans eg united healthcare and cigna and retail pharmacies which have their own pbm capabilities as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours 

retail pharmacy segment 

as of december 31 2010 the retail pharmacy segment included 7182 retail drugstores of which 7123 operated a pharmacy our online retail website cvscom and our retail health care clinics the retail drugstores are located in 41 states puerto rico and the district of columbia operating primarily under the cvspharmacy name we currently operate in 92 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 72 of these markets cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise which we refer to as “front store” products existing retail stores range in size from approximately 8000 to 25000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 10000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during 2010 we filled approximately 636 million retail prescriptions or approximately 18 of the us retail pharmacy market 

as of december 31 2010 we operated 560 retail health care clinics in 26 states and the district of columbia under the minuteclinic name of which 550 were located within cvspharmacy stores the clinics utilize nationally recognized medical protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions perform health screenings monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations the clinics are staffed by boardcertified nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide access to affordable care without appointment 

retail pharmacy business strategy  our integrated pharmacy services model has enhanced the ability of our retail pharmacy stores to expand customer access to care while helping to lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes in that regard the role of our retail pharmacist is shifting from primarily dispensing prescriptions to also providing services including flu vaccinations as well as facetoface patient counseling with respect to adherence to drug therapies closing gaps in care and more cost effective drug therapies in addition we seek to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

retail pharmacy products and services  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business 

  

consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows 

 

  

 front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states in addition the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 4400 cvs brand and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 17 of our front store revenues during 2010 

pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in each of 2010 2009 and 2008 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the impact of health care reform the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products medicare part d and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology consumers need medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our customers with these needs we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging them in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include our patient care initiative an enhanced medication adherence program our customer savings initiative which educates customers about cost savings opportunities maintenance choice a flexible fulfillment option that affords eligible pbm plan members the convenient choice of filling their 90day supply of maintenance medications at any cvspharmacy store or obtaining them through mail order in either case at the cost of mail which is typically lower for both the plan member and payor pharmacy advisor our new program that uses our consumer engagement engine technology to facilitate facetoface pharmacist counseling to plan members of participating pbm clients concerning health and safety matters including adherence issues gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions and the extracare health card program further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our new pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect tm  our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  and our online business cvscom 

minuteclinic  as of december 31 2010 we operated 560 minuteclinics in 26 states and the district of columbia 550 of which were located in cvspharmacy stores minuteclinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health 

  

conditions perform health screenings monitor chronic conditions and deliver vaccinations many locations have also begun treating a variety of chronic conditions insurers value minuteclinic because it provides an excellent quality of care at an affordable price in many cases offering an attractive alternative to the far more expensive emergency room as a result visits paid for by employers health insurers or other third parties accounted for more than 80 of minuteclinics’ total revenues in 2010 we anticipate opening up 100 new clinics in cvspharmacy stores during 2011 

retail pharmacy store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2010 we opened 179 new retail pharmacy stores relocated 106 stores and closed 22 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1400 new and relocated stores and acquired approximately 1200 stores during 2011 we expect to open between 225 and 250 new or relocated stores and close approximately 15 stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

retail pharmacy information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency in 2009 we began the rollout of rx connect which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions the rollout of rx connect was completed in september 2010 our new consumer engagement engine technology enables us to message pharmacists at the point of care which facilitates facetoface counseling by our pharmacies regarding patient health and safety matters including adherence issues gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone we continue to enhance our visible improvement in profits execution and results “viper” system a transactionmonitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to transactions processed through our pointofsale systems in addition we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking 

retail pharmacy customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 974 of our 2010 pharmacy revenues since our revenues relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single commercial retail payor accounts for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues we also fill prescriptions for many government funded programs including state medicaid plans and federal medicare part d drug plans our contracts with commercial payors and government funded programs are subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates see “government regulation – reimbursement” and item 1a “risk factors – efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses ” 

retail pharmacy seasonality  the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 80 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 which section is incorporated by reference herein 

retail pharmacy competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent 

  

and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs health clinics and internet pharmacies 

corporate segment 

our corporate segment provides management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the company the corporate segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management corporate relations legal compliance human resources corporate information technology and finance departments

government regulation 

overview  as a participant in the health care industry our retail and pharmacy services businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern the purchase sale and distribution of prescription drugs and related services including administration and management of prescription drug benefits many of our pbm clients including insurers and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted we are unable to predict what federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or any adverse applications of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

ppaca  congress passed major health reform legislation in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively “ppaca” which were signed into law by the president on march 23 2010 and march 30 2010 respectively this legislation affects the entire health insurance system and virtually every aspect of health care in the country although many provisions of the ppaca are not effective immediately given that many of the regulations implementing ppaca have not yet been issued or finalized and there is ongoing subregulatory guidance being issued there is still considerable uncertainty as to its full impact further aspects of the legislation are being challenged in lawsuits across the country and some in congress are seeking to repeal the law or portions of it there have already been a number of conflicting court rulings calling into question the constitutionality of all or certain portions of ppaca in addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage beginning in 2014 ppaca enacted a number of significant health care reforms while these reforms may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients as a result they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices 

among the more significant ppaca provisions is the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio “mlr” to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees the mlr requires insurers to break out clinical quality improvement and administrative costs the united states department of health and human services “hhs” issued an interim final regulation on the mlr in december 2010 that includes an example that could be interpreted to suggest that the differential between the drug price charged by pbms to health plans and the amount reimbursed to retail pharmacies commonly referred to as “differential” or “spread” should be excluded from claims costs depending on if and how this example is clarified in final regulations health plan clients that are subject to the mlr requirements may request pricing modifications include requests to contract using passthrough retail network pricing 

another ppaca provision requires pbms that contract with a medicare part d plan or a qualified health plan offered through a health insurance exchange to disclose certain information to hhs the medicare part d plan or the health insurance exchange among the information that must be disclosed is the generic dispensing rates for different types of pharmacies the aggregate amount and types of rebates and other discounts negotiated on behalf of and passed through to the plan and the aggregate amount of any differential it is anticipated that this reporting will be required for medicare part d in 2012 and for qualified health plans in 2014 upon the implementation of the health insurance exchanges to be established under ppaca ppaca also made significant changes to the medicare and medicaid programs fraud and abuse laws and tax provisions some of the relevant changes are discussed in other sections below 

in addition to ppaca among the existing federal and state laws and regulations that affect aspects of our business are the following 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds state laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs the federal antiremuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts the office of inspector general the “oig” within the hhs and administrative bodies a broad interpretation of the federal antiremuneration law is supported by ppaca which codified a reduced standard of “knowingly and willfully” by stating that this standard does not require that a person have actual knowledge of the federal antiremuneration law or specific intent to violate this law because of the federal statute’s broad scope hhs established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers 

  

certain personal services arrangements certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians and certain other transactions and relationships a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by hhs in addition as part of ppaca additional statutory exceptions have been created to permit the provision of certain incentives to federal healthcare program beneficiaries including retailer coupons rebates or other rewards and incentives offered to promote access to care 

in april 2003 the oig issued compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the “oig guidance” in the oig guidance the oig identifies potential risk areas for pharmaceutical manufacturers and also discusses a number of traditional relationships between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms such as discount payments service offerings and data sales and recommends that such relationships be structured wherever possible to fit within an applicable safe harbor 

antitrust and unfair competition  the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” relief under the ftca can encompass equitable relief and consumer redress in addition numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufactures andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

compliance programs  ppaca requires that providers enrolled in medicare and medicaid must establish and maintain compliance programs that satisfy core requirements to be established by the secretary of hhs in consultation with the oig the secretary of hhs has not yet published information concerning these compliance programs or the timeframe for implementation in addition certain state government health care programs have compliance program requirements and we are subject to various government agreements described under “government agreements” below that also contain requirements relating to the maintenance of compliance programs 

consumer protection laws  the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services and financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs in addition the ftca bars unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce the federal postal service act generally prohibits the mailing of and billing for unordered merchandise the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule also imposes extensive requirements and restrictions in connection with telemarketing which applies to plans or programs to induce the purchase of goods or services by consumers see the telemarketing and other outbound calls section below for further disclosures 

contract audits  we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pbm rebate contracts our pharmacy provider agreements and our contracts relating to medicare part d audits are typically conducted pursuant to certain provisions in our contracts that grant audit rights and set forth applicable audit procedures because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate pdps or medicare advantage organizations under the mma the audits generally focus on among other things compliance with the applicable terms of our contracts and applicable legal requirements 

disease management services regulation  we provide or arrange for pbm plan members to receive clinical services in the form of disease management programs for common and rare medical conditions nurses 

  

pharmacists and other clinicians as needed develop and implement these programs state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing and clinicians engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

electronic prescribing  the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” which was signed into law in february 2009 amended the social security act to establish incentive payments to eligible professionals and hospitals participating in the medicare or medicaid program that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health records “ehr” technology beginning in 2011 arra also provides for downward payment adjustments beginning in 2015 for providers in the medicare program that fail to adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr technology among the measures of meaningful use is the use of electronic prescribing a final rule implementing the ehr incentive program was issued in july 2010 which requires that at least 40 of permissible prescriptions be sent electronically in order to qualify for the incentive payments in march 2010 the us drug enforcement administration “dea” issued an interim final rule allowing electronic prescribing of controlled substances beginning june 1 2010 these changes together with the requirement for medicare part d plans to support electronic prescribing should result in a growing number of prescribers adopting electronic prescribing 

environmental regulation  our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities there is also an increased interest by regulators in better managing photo processing as well as pharmaceutical and other wastes we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency 

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

erisa fiduciaries may be held personally liable for entering into service contracts or arrangements like pbm contracts on behalf of erisa plans if the terms of the contract are not reasonable or if the service provider receives more than reasonable compensation for the services provided in such cases the service provider may also be required to disgorge any unreasonable compensation received and may be subject to civil penalties imposed by the us department of labor “dol” 

in november 2007 the dol announced final revisions to form 5500 and its related schedules effective for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2009 the revised form 5500 which most pension and welfare plans subject to erisa are required to file includes modifications to schedule c on which plans are required to report compensation paid to service providers 

in december 2009 the dol also announced a new project to promulgate regulations under section 408b2 of erisa the regulations which were previously issued in proposed form could require service providers including pbms to provide detailed disclosure regarding all direct and indirect compensation to be received in connection with the services to be provided as well as potential conflicts of interest 

  

we cannot be certain the extent to which newly issued disclosure regulations may apply to our business as the dol has provided very little final guidance regarding what constitutes reportable compensation under a pbm agreement 

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act “fca” which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 “fera” implemented substantial changes to the fca which expand the scope of fca liability provide for new investigative tools and make it easier for qui tam relators often referred to as “whistleblowers” to bring and maintain fca suits on behalf of the government ppaca further eased the burden for whistleblowers to bring and maintain fca suits by modifying the “public disclosure” and “original source” provisions of the fca some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws fera also expanded the fca to cover improperly avoiding an obligation 

to pay money to the government and ppaca clarified that the retention of overpayments beyond the repayment deadline is a violation of the fca in addition ppaca provides that a violation of the federal antiremuneration law constitutes a false or fraudulent act under the fca and expands the jurisdiction of the fca to the health insurance exchanges to be created under ppaca ppaca also provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made any false or fraudulent record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment under a governmentsponsored program for knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment and for false statements in provider enrollment applications the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section 

in addition federal and state governments have commenced numerous investigations of various pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers in recent years with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters the federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the fca by i improperly marketing and pricing drugs ii overstating the average wholesale prices of products iii paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs andor iv failing to accurately report “best price” under the medicaid program 

fda regulation  the united states food and drug administration “fda” generally has authority to regulate drugs drug classifications and drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer we previously operated a fdaregulated repackaging facility where we repackaged certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies but we closed this repackaging facility in april 2010 the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs in addition the fda has authority to require the submission and implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy “rems” if the fda determines that that a rems is necessary for the safe and effective marketing of a drug to the extent we dispense products subject to rems requirements or provide rems services to pharmaceutical manufacturers we are subject to audit by the fda and the pharmaceutical manufacturer the fda also has 

  

regulatory authority over medical devices such as otc genetic tests and genetic tests conducted by medical laboratories and the fda continues to evaluate the need for further regulation of such tests 

formulary regulation  a number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the naic has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of medicare part d in july 2008 congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act which requires the secretary for hhs to identify certain classes and categories of drugs for which subject to certain exceptions all the drugs in any such class or category must be included in a medicare part d plan’s formulary the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients 

government agreements  in september 2005 caremark’s subsidiary advancepcs now known as caremarkpcs llc entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government relating to certain alleged pbm business practices pursuant to which advancepcs agreed among other things to adhere to certain business practices pursuant to a consent order and to maintain a compliance program in accordance with a corporate integrity agreement entered into with the oig for a period of five years this corporate integrity agreement expired by its terms in september 2010 however our pbm business remains subject to the terms of a consent order entered into with a number of states in the first quarter of 2008 relating to certain of our pbm business practices 

in march 2008 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government and a number of states related to the dispensing of the generic drug ranitidine at its retail pharmacies at the same time the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig for a period of five years applicable to certain retail and mail service operations of the company this 2008 corporate integrity agreement requires among other things maintenance of our compliance program employee training specific reviews by an independent review organization and various government reporting obligations failure to meet our obligations under this corporate integrity agreement could result in stipulated financial penalties and failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our applicable business from participation in federal health care programs 

in january 2009 we entered into separate settlement agreements with the ftc and the hhs office for civil rights “ocr” resolving a joint investigation prompted by 2006 media reports of disposal of patient information in dumpsters at a limited number of cvspharmacy locations as part of the ftc settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate enterprisewide information security policies and procedures during the twenty year term of the agreement the ftc settlement also provides for periodic compliance monitoring by an external assessor as part of the ocr settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate waste disposal policies and procedures training and employee sanctions at our retail stores the ocr settlement has a three year term and provides for annual compliance monitoring by an external assessor 

in october 2010 the company entered into a nonprosecution agreement and civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice “doj” and various united states attorneys’ offices relating to the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine products at certain cvspharmacy stores primarily in california and nevada 

  

the company also entered into a related memorandum of agreement with the dea the nonprosecution agreement and the memorandum of agreement contain certain ongoing compliance requirements for the company and failure to comply with the terms of these documents could lead to civil or criminal remedies financial penalties andor administrative remedies against the dea registrations for our retail pharmacies and distribution centers 

in addition to the government agreements described above the company andor its various affiliates are subject to other consent decrees or settlement agreements with various federal state and local authorities that may contain certain ongoing repotting monitoring or other compliance requirements for the company these agreements relate to such matters as privacy practices waste disposal practices selling expired products environmental and safety matters tobacco sales marketing and advertising practices pharmacy operations and various other business practices 

managed care reform  in addition to health reforms enacted by ppaca proposed legislation has been considered at the state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

medicare part d  the mma created medicare part d the medicare drug benefit program in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for drug coverage under medicare part d regulations implementing medicare part d included requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks marketing of medicare part d plans processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards the medicare part d program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception including changes made by ppaca effective for the 2010 plan year cms issued a regulation requiring that any “differential” or “spread” be reported as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost of the plan sponsor for purposes of calculating certain government subsidy payments and the drug price to be charged to enrollees this change resulted in medicare part d plan sponsors contracting for passthrough pricing for their retail networks rather than pricing that included the use of retail network “differential” or “spread” this regulatory change has reduced the profitability of our medicare part d business other regulatory changes effective for the 2010 plan year include requiring that any rebates retained by the pbm reduce the medicare part d sponsor’s drug costs reported to the government regardless of the terms of the contract between the pbm and medicare part d sponsor requiring that clean claims from pharmacies be paid within 14 days for electronic claims or 30 days for nonelectronic claims and that substantially all drugs in certain clinical classes be included on formularies 

regulatory changes effective for the 2011 plan year include giving cms greater latitude to limit the number of medicare part d plans available by allowing it to eliminate plans with persistently low enrollment and plans that it views as poor performers based on certain cms performance criteria shortening the period for medicare part d sponsors that acquire other medicare part d plans to merge the plans or otherwise change them so that their plan offerings remain substantially different and limiting the period for coordination of benefits to three years for all payers ppaca changes to the medicare part d benefit that are effective for the 2011 plan year include the implementation of the gap discount program under which participating manufacturers fund discounts of 50 on brand drugs obtained during the coverage gap or “donut hole” starting the phaseout of the coverage gap for generic drugs to be completed by 2020 allowing medicare part d plans that bid a “ de minimis ” amount above the lowincome subsidy “lis” benchmark to absorb the cost of the difference between their bid and the lis benchmark in order to avoid reassignment of their lis enrollees simplification of election periods for medicare 

  

parts c and d reducing the premium subsidy for higherincome beneficiaries extending complaint tracking and reporting and simplifying the appeals process for enrollees ppaca also requires the secretary of hhs to develop rules for shorter dispensing periods for enrollees in longterm care “ltc” facilities in order to reduce waste beginning in 2012 and new disclosure requirements are expected to be implemented in 2012 hhs issued proposed regulations in november 2010 that would among other things require dispensing of brand medications to enrollees in ltc facilities in no greater than 7day increments at a time and require additional reporting by medicare part d plans on dispensing methodologies and unused prescriptions returned to stock by ltc pharmacies several of the ppaca changes will require significant adjudication and reporting systems modifications 

medicare part d continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

mental health parity legislation  the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 was signed into law on october 3 2008 and an interim final rule implementing the law was issued on february 2 2010 compliance is required for plan years beginning on or after july 1 2010 the law requires group health plans that provide both medicalsurgical benefits and mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits to ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations that apply to the mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits are no more restrictive than those that apply to the medicalsurgical benefits while the regulation contains a special rule allowing for “multitiered prescription drug benefits” that meet certain conditions there is considerable uncertainty regarding the application of the rule this has caused some group health plans to consider dropping mental health benefits including drugs that treat these conditions to avoid being found in violation of the regulation 

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in medicare part d and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d sponsor for each type of pharmacy in its network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our clients or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm clients such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may i prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network andor ii impact how we conduct audits of network pharmacies and recover audit discrepancies except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

pbm laws and regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to clients and plan members ii require pbms to remit to clients or their plan members certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to clients and their plan members andor v impose licensing or registration requirements to the extent states or 

  

other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm or specialty pharmacy activities for example urac has issued pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark is currently accredited as a pbm by urac while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm or specialty pharmacy services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment 

pharmacy licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substance and listed chemical products and medical and controlled substance waste disposal federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances federal and state controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and distribution centers with the dea and state controlled substances agencies and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control personnel and labeling standards in order to possess and dispense controlled substances and listed chemical products 

we also are subject to regulation by the dea and state pharmacy boards in connection with our online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods numerous state laws also exist affecting our receipt and processing of electronic prescription drug orders 

certain violations of the federal controlled substances laws can subject the company its pharmacies and distribution centers and individual pharmacy personnel to criminal and civil penalties and can also result in administrative action by the dea including suspension or revocation of a pharmacy’s or distribution center’s registration to distribute controlled substances andor listed chemical products state authorities and state boards of pharmacy similarly have the authority to impose both monetary penalties and disciplinary sanctions including revocation of a pharmacy’s or individual pharmacist’s license to dispense controlled substances and these penalties and sanctions are in addition to sanctions imposed under the federal controlled substances laws certain violations of these federal and state legal requirements can also trigger other consequences for the company’s business and could potentially impact our eligibility to participate in federal health care programs see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the ftc requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail and state licensing authorities may restrict the types of personnel who may work in mail service operations 

our pharmacists and technicians are subject to state regulation of the profession of pharmacy and our employees who are engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing or registration requirements and 

  

comply with applicable professional standards failure to comply with these regulations could subject us and our employees to disciplinary action including fines and could cause our licenses and permits and our employees licenses to be suspended or revoked 

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan member may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic interchange requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and ppaca requires the coverage of certain preventive services at no cost sharing such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our clients generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies or for use of certain health care providers legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our clients and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information “pii” as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws which require organizations to provide appropriate privacy protections and security safeguards for such information in addition to pii we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” hipaa also gives individuals certain rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain the individual’s written authorization criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

in february 2009 congress enacted the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” as part of arra during 2010 ocr promulgated new and updated nonfinal regulations in response to the hitech act the hitech act contains significant changes to the hipaa privacy and security rules which these regulations began to address these include new restrictions on the use of phi without an individual’s written authorization a new requirement to account for routine disclosures of phi held in an electronic health record a requirement to notify individuals of breaches to their phi new enforcement rights of state attorneys general extension of the federal privacy and security law provisions and penalties to business associates of covered entities and increased penalties for violation of the law while some of the provision of the hitech act are already in effect final regulations regarding the hipaa privacy security enforcement and data breach rules are expected to be issued by ocr early in 2011 since the rules implementing much of the hitech act have not yet been finalized we cannot at this time determine the extent to which these changes may apply to or impact our business 

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa most states have also enacted legislation and regulations governing the security of pii and specifying notification requirements for any security breaches invoicing pii 

  

in addition to hipaa and hitech the genetic information nondiscrimination act “gina” was signed into law on may 21 2008 and proposed and interim final regulations were issued under it in 2009 and 2010 gina prohibits discrimination based on genetic information in health coverage title i and employment title ii under gina health plans are not permitted to use or disclose genetic information for underwriting purposes which includes eligibility determinations they also may not collect genetic information such as by requiring genetic testing except in very limited circumstances 

reimbursement  a significant portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state reimbursement laws and regulatory requirements antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs as well as employers and other entities that qualify for the medicare part d drug subsidy andor the early retiree reinsurance program created under ppaca 

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark in conjunction with a class action settlement implemented in september 2009 involving first databank “fdb” and medispan two entities that publish the awp of pharmaceuticals the methodology used to calculate awp was modified in a manner that reduced awp for many brand drugs and some generic drugs we have reached understandings with most of our pbm clients and other third party payors to adjust reimbursements to account for this change in methodology but most state medicaid programs that utilize awp as a pricing reference have not taken action to make similar adjustments as a result we have experienced reduced medicaid reimbursement for certain products since the settlement was implemented in addition fdb has indicated that it intends to discontinue the publishing of awp altogether in september 2011 although medispan has indicated that it intends to continue publishing awp we believe the pharmaceutical industry will be evaluating andor developing an alternative pricing reference to replace awp we will continue to work with our pbm clients and other payors to anticipate and mitigate the impact of possible future changes to applicable references for pricing pharmaceuticals awp has already been replaced by average sales price as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs investigations have commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether the best price available to essentially any client other than the medicaid program or “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers ppaca increased the amount of rebates required to be paid by manufacturers under the medicaid program and also imposes certain annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers we do not anticipate the increased medicaid rebate levels or the annual fees to impact the discounts we obtain from pharmaceutical companies 

ppaca made several other significant changes to the medicaid rebates and reimbursement one of these was to revise the definition of amp and the reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs cms has not 

  

yet issued regulations implementing these changes therefore we cannot predict the effect of these changes on medicaid reimbursement or their impact on the company another significant ppaca change was to require brand and generic manufacturers to pay rebates for product dispensed to beneficiaries enrolled in medicaid mcos similar to the way rebates are now required for medicaid feeforservice “ffs” beneficiaries beginning in 2010 medicaid mcos are not prohibited from negotiating with manufacturers for rebates above medicaid’s statutory rebates however the expansion of the federal medicaid rebate program to medicaid mcos has generally resulted in a reduction of the rebates that manufacturers are willing to pay to the medicaid mcos and a reduction of the rebates we receive under our rebate agreements on behalf of our medicaid mco clients 

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

changes in reporting of awp amp asp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors andor could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us congress then expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new or pending health legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

retail clinics  states also regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation and expansion of our owned and managed retail clinics 

  

retiree drug subsidy  the mma created a drug subsidy program available to certain employer union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to medicare part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to medicare part d coverage the subsidy is equal to 28 of drug costs and is currently taxfree however for plan years beginning in 2013 ppaca eliminates the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans this may cause some employers to transition their retirees to employersponsored medicare part d plans as part of ppaca congress established a new temporary early retiree reinsurance program providing reimbursement to employer and union sponsors of participating employmentbased plans for a portion of the cost of health benefits for early retirees aged 55 to 64 and their spouses surviving spouses and dependents the program reimburses sponsors for certain claims between 15000 and 90000 congress appropriated funding of 5 billion for this temporary program which became effective june 1 2010 the program ends when the funding is exhausted but no later than january 1 2014 

safety regulation  the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended “osha” establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury compliance with standards promulgated under osha and various record keeping reporting and procedural requirements many of these osha standards as well as various state and local laws and regulations pertaining to employee safety and health apply to our operations any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities 

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid program exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark 

law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

state insurance laws  feeforservice prescription drug plans and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guaranties or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

our silverscript and accendo pdps each must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under applicable state laws or they must have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms both silverscript and accendo are licensed in all states in which they offer pdps and do not operate under any medicare part d waivers as licensed insurance companies silverscript and accendo and their agents are subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial licensing and operational reports pursuant to 

  

the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps but the application of other state laws to medicare part d are generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our clients or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that supplement medicare part d payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner medicare part d plans are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps have also received permission from cms to autoassign their enrollees that do not choose their own medicare part d plans into pdps 

telemarketing and other outbound calls  certain federal and state laws give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound calls these laws may require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when consumers may be called require consumer consent prior to being called require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services and require the retention of specific business records 

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the fca contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance 

we can give no assurance however that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business or the pharmacy services or retail industry iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services or retail industry iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services or retail industry

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns these changes could affect drug utilization trends as well as the financial health and number of covered lives of our pbm clients resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in that regard the economic recession resulted in declining drug utilization trends which continued into 2010 although a recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause further decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores if this were to occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

further interest rate fluctuations changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms 

  

inability to fully realize the benefits of our fully integrated pharmacy services model 

we may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated longterm strategic benefits of the march 2007 caremark merger an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock 

risks relating to the pending acquisition of uac’s medicare part d business 

in december 2010 the company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the medicare part d business of uac for approximately 125 billion the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including necessary regulatory approvals as well as approval by uac shareholders the company currently expects that the transaction will close by the end of the second quarter of 2011 in the event the closing is delayed or does not occur andor the regulatory review process materially alters the terms of the acquisition the company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the transaction 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may affect health care financing and reimbursement practices if the current health care financing and reimbursement system changes significantly the company’s business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

ppaca made several significant changes to medicaid rebates and reimbursement one of these changes was to revise the definition of amp and the reimbursement formula for multisource drugs cms has not yet issued regulations implementing these changes therefore we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on medicaid reimbursement or their impact on the company in addition ppaca made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum mlr to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees these ppaca changes may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our services andor business practices 

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract therefore we face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing pbm business although none of our pbm clients represented more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2010 our top 10 clients are expected to represent approximately 21 of such revenues in 2011 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new 

  

business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms our failure to renew or win pbm business could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused caremark and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition market dynamics and regulatory changes have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail “differential” or “spread” which could negatively impact our future profitability further changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive accordingly margin pressure in the pbm industry resulting from these trends could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d may adversely affect our business financial position and our results of operations 

since its inception in 2006 medicare part d has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of medicare part d and as a result of the elimination in 2013 of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of medicare part d may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part d exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare part d and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of medicare part d or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants if cms imposes sanctions or other restrictions on our medicare part d business as a result of audits or other regulatory actions or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under medicare part d’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be materially and adversely affected and our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

implementation of the fdb and medispan settlements described in the government regulation section have resulted in changes in the methodology used to calculate awp which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors following these settlements fdb has indicated that it intends to discontinue the publishing of awp altogether in september 2011 although medispan has indicated that it intends to continue publishing awp for the foreseeable future we believe the pharmaceutical industry will be evaluating andor developing an alternative pricing reference to replace awp 

future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pbm business currently operates in a highly competitive environment as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers independent pharmacies membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

competitors in the pbm industry include large national pbm companies such as medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg united healthcare and cigna and retail pharmacies which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

reform of the us health care system may adversely affect our financial performance and the services we provide 

congressional efforts to reform the us health care system finally came to fruition in 2010 with the passage of ppaca which will bring about the most significant structural changes to the health insurance system in decades while the bulk of the structural changes enacted by ppaca will not be implemented until 2014 and some of the key changes such as the individual mandate are already being challenged at the judicial and legislative levels it is expected that there will be increased government involvement in health care and regulation of pbm or pharmacy services this may change the way the company or its clients do business health plan sponsors may react to these changes and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the company would provide the company cannot predict what effect if any the ppaca changes may have on its retail and pharmacy services businesses other legislative or market 

  

driven changes in the health care system that the company cannot anticipate could also have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

our inability to comply with a broad and complex regulatory framework could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

the pbm business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business – government regulation” changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued 

operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and regulations of the fda the ftc the dea and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell we are also subject to the terms of the government agreements described in the government regulation section in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be affected by existing and new government legislative and regulatory action including without limitation any one or more of the following

business segments 

during the third quarter of 2009 we made changes to our reportable segments to reflect changes that were made to the way our management evaluates the performance of operations develops strategy and allocates resources this change involves recording certain administrative expenses previously recorded within the pharmacy services and retail pharmacy segments in a new corporate segment the corporate segment consists of costs primarily associated with executive management corporate relations legal compliance human resources corporate information technology and finance this change had no impact on our consolidated results of operations as a result of this change the company has three segments pharmacy services retail pharmacy and corporate our historical segment disclosures have been revised to conform to the current presentation 

during the third quarter of 2009 we also made a change to our pharmacy services segment as it relates to our intersegment activities such as the maintenance choice ® program this change impacts the gross profit and operating profit lines within the pharmacy services segment under the maintenance choice program eligible members in plans sponsored by pharmacy services clients can elect to pick up their maintenance prescriptions at retail pharmacy segment stores instead of receiving them through the mail when this occurs both the pharmacy services and retail pharmacy segments now record the revenue gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis and corresponding intersegment eliminations are made this change had no impact on our consolidated results of operations

our business strategy  our business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality client service in order to enhance clinical outcomes for our clients’ health benefit plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall healthcare costs we produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core pbm services including as described more fully below plan design and administration formulary management drug purchasing arrangements mail order services specialty pharmacy services retail pharmacy network management services medicare part d services and a broad array of clinical services 

in addition as a result of the caremark merger we are able to offer our clients and their plan members a variety of new programs and plan designs that benefit from our integrated information systems and the ability of our more than 26000 pharmacists nurse practioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the many plan members who shop our stores every day through our multiple member touch points retail stores mail order and specialty pharmacies retail clinics call centers and proprietary websites we seek to engage plan members in behaviors that lower cost and improve healthcare outcomes examples of these programs and services include maintenance choice new compliance and persistency programs designed to ensure that patients take their medications in the proper manner enhanced disease management programs that are targeted at managing chronic disease states and a new extracare health card program which offers discounts to eligible plan members on certain overthecounter healthcare products sold in our cvspharmacy stores in addition we are working with our clients to i decrease unnecessary and expensive emergency room visits by encouraging plan members to use minuteclinic locations for everyday common ailments and ii create pilot programs that offer convenient unique services available at minuteclinic such as injection training for specialty pharmacy services 

while certain of these programs and services have already been adopted by many of our clients others are in the formative stage and require additional information system enhancements andor changes in work processes accordingly there can be no assurance as to timing or benefits associated with certain of these programs 

our services  the pbm services we provide for our clients involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the cost and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use these services are described more fully below 

plan design and administration  our clients sponsor pharmacy benefit plans that facilitate the ability of eligible members in these plans to receive medications prescribed by their physicians we assist our clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that minimize the costs to the client while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the clients’ members we also administer these benefit plans for our clients and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent informal communications as well as through a formal annual client review 

we make recommendations to our clients encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug we believe that we help our clients control costs by recommending plans that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our clients also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists 

formulary management  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure member access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for members and clients we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug lists and generic equivalent products as well as of our clinical programs many of our clients choose to adopt our drug lists as part of their plan design 

  

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to clients that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for our receiving discounts from established list prices in various ways in that regard these discounts generally take the form of a direct discount at the time of purchase a discount for prompt payment of invoices or when products are indirectly purchased from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacychain a retroactive discount or rebate we also receive additional discounts under our wholesale contracts if we exceed contractuallydefined annual purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues 

prescription management systems  we dispense prescription drugs both directly through one of our mail service or specialty pharmacies or through a network of retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating tests for various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

mail pharmacy program  as of december 31 2009 we operated six large automated mail service pharmacies in the continental united states our clients or their prescribers submit prescriptions primarily for maintenance medications to these pharmacies via mail telephone fax or the internet we also operate a network of smaller mail service specialty pharmacies described below our staff pharmacists review mail service prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems this review may involve communications with the prescriber and with the prescriber’s approval can result in generic substitution therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to reduce cost or to improve quality of treatment 

specialty pharmacy  our specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies as of december 31 2009 our specialty pharmacies were comprised of 18 specialty mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states and are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders through our theracom subsidiary we provide new product launch services for manufacturers of specialty drugs substantially all of these pharmacies have been accredited by the joint commission which is an independent notforprofit organization which accredits and certifies more than 17000 health care organizations and programs in the united states as of december 31 2009 the company operated a network of 49 retail specialty pharmacy stores which operate under the careplus cvspharmacy name these stores average 2000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications homeopathic remedies and vitamins 

onsite pharmacies  we also operate a limited number of small pharmacies located at client sites under the careplus cvspharmacy cvspharmacy or careplus name which provide members with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

retail pharmacy network  we maintain a national network of approximately 64000 retail pharmacies including cvspharmacy stores when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant customer data including eligibility and member information and perform a drug utilization review to determine clinical appropriateness and safety in addition to confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

medicare part d services  we participate in the administration of the drug benefit added to the medicare program under part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” the “medicare drug benefit” through the provision of pbm services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as medicare part d prescription drug plans “pdp” we also participate i by 

  

offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits through our subsidiaries silverscript and accendo which have been approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” as pdps and ii by assisting employer union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility andor drug cost data to cms in order for them to obtain the subsidy 

clinical services  we offer multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner our programs are primarily designed to target safety inappropriate utilization and nonadherence to medication each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively impact members’ health and the client’s pharmacy and medical spend in this regard we offer various utilization management medication management adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies 

disease management programs  our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers and other third parties our accordantcare health management programs include integrated rare disease management programs which cover diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis parkinson’s disease seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance “ncqa” a private notforprofit organization that evaluates accredits and certifies a wide range of health care organizations in addition we have entered into a strategic alliance with alere llc for the management of our common disease management program offerings which cover such chronic diseases as asthma diabetes congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease 

quality assurance  we have adopted and implemented clinical quality assurance procedures as well as policies and procedures to help ensure regulatory compliance under our quality assurance programs each new mail service prescription undergoes a sequence of safety and accuracy checks and is reviewed and verified by a registered pharmacist before shipment we also analyze drugrelated outcomes to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care 

pharmacogenomic services  in december 2009 we acquired a majority interest in generation health inc a genetic benefit management company that will allow us to expand our offering of pharmacogenomic clinical and testing services to our pbm clients pharmacogenomics is the study of how genetic makeup affects an individual’s response to drug therapies through genetic testing doctors are able to evaluate a patient’s genetic makeup to determine the effectiveness of specific drugs drug dosages and drug combinations through this relationship we expect to use genetic testing to apply greater precision to client prescription management with the goal of improving individual health outcomes and reducing overall medical costs we expect to begin to offer these services to clients during 2010 

information systems  we currently operate multiple information systems platforms to support our pharmacy services segment these information systems incorporate architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other pbm clients’ service contracts 

clients  our clients are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans employers unions government employee groups insurance companies and managed care organizations and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients and utilize our information systems to perform safety checks drug interaction screening and generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by our clients during the year ended december 31 2009 we managed approximately 660 million prescriptions for individuals from over 3000 organizations 

  

competition  we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to clients’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to clients and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members the pharmacy services segment competes with a number of large national pbm companies including medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many smaller local or regional pbms we also compete with several large health insurersmanaged care plans eg unitedhealthcare aetna and cigna and retail pharmacies which have their own pbm capabilities as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours 

retail pharmacy segment 

as of december 31 2009 the retail pharmacy segment included 7025 retail drugstores of which 6964 operated a pharmacy our online retail website cvscom and our retail health care clinics the retail drugstores are located in 41 states and the district of columbia operating primarily under the cvspharmacy name we currently operate in 91 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 68 of these markets cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise which we refer to as “front store” products existing retail stores range in size from approximately 8000 to 25000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 10000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during fiscal 2009 we filled approximately 615 million retail prescriptions or approximately 18 of the us retail pharmacy market 

as of december 31 2009 we operated 569 retail health care clinics in 25 states and the district of columbia under the minuteclinic name of which 557 were located within cvspharmacy stores the clinics utilize nationally recognized medical protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions and are staffed by boardcertified nurse practitioners and physician assistants 

our business strategy  our goal is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

our products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows 

 

  

   

pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented more than twothirds of retail pharmacy revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products the medicare drug benefit and our on going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology consumers require medication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars to assist our consumers with these requirements we have introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier easier and more effective approach to engaging plan members in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples include maintenance choice a flexible fulfillment option that affords eligible plan members the convenient choice of picking up their 90day supply of maintenance medications at any cvspharmacy store or obtaining them through mail order in either case at the cost of mail which is typically lower for both the plan member and payor enhanced medication adherence programs and the extracare ® health card program further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our new pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect tm  our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  and our online business cvscom 

front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states in addition the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand and proprietary brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 4300 cvs brand and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 17 of our front store revenues during 2009 

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2009 we opened 178 new retail pharmacy stores relocated 109 stores and closed 76 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1400 new and relocated stores and acquired approximately 1200 stores during 2010 we expect to open between 250 and 300 new or relocated stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

minuteclinic  as of december 31 2009 we operated 569 minuteclinics in 25 states and the district of columbia 557 of these locations were located in cvspharmacy stores minuteclinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally recognized protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions perform health screenings and deliver vaccinations many locations have also begun treating a variety of chronic conditions insurers value minuteclinic because it provides a high level of care at a competitive price in many cases offering an attractive alternative to the far more expensive emergency room as result visits paid for by employers health insurers or other third parties accounted for more than 80 of minuteclinics’ total revenues in 2009 

  

information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency in 2009 we began the rollout of rx connect which is reengineering the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions the rollout of rx connect will be completed by the end of 2010 further we continue to enhance our assisted inventory management system which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both increases instock positions in the stores and lowers our investment in inventory we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone we continue to enhance our visible improvement in profits execution and results “viper” system a transactionmonitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to transactions processed through our pointofsale systems in addition we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking 

customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 965 of our 2009 pharmacy revenues since our revenues relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total revenues we also fill prescriptions for many government funded programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans our contracts with such government funded programs are subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates see “government regulation – reimbursement” and item 1a “risk factors – efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses ” 

seasonality  the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 71 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 which section is incorporated by reference herein 

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs health clinics and internet pharmacies 

corporate segment 

our corporate segment provides management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the company the corporate segment consists of certain aspects of our executive management corporate relations legal compliance human resources corporate information technology and finance departments

government regulation 

overview  as a participant in the health care industry our retail and pharmacy services businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern the purchase sale and distribution of prescription drugs and related services including administration and management of prescription drug benefits many of our pbm clients including insurers and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor the application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty this is especially the case today as congress considers major health reform legislation that could affect the entire health insurance system and virtually every aspect of health care in the country at the time of this writing different versions of health reform legislation had passed in the house and the senate however it remains to be seen whether any legislation will ultimately be passed and signed into law by the president and if so what it will include in addition to this major pending legislation regulation of the health care industry continues to evolve and there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels some of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted we are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on our business any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or any adverse applications of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

among the existing federal and state laws and regulations that affect aspects of our business are the following 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds state laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs the federal antiremuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts the office of inspector general the “oig” within the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and administrative bodies because of the federal statute’s broad scope hhs established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers certain personal services arrangements certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians and certain other transactions and relationships a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by hhs 

  

in april 2003 the oig issued compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the “oig guidance” in the oig guidance the oig identifies potential risk areas for pharmaceutical manufacturers and also discusses a number of traditional relationships between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms such as discount payments service offerings and data sales and recommends that such relationships be structured wherever possible to fit within an applicable safe harbor 

antitrust and unfair competition  the federal trade commission “ftc” has authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftca” to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfair methods of competition” relief under the ftca can encompass equitable relief and consumer redress in addition numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufactures andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

comprehensive pbm regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to clients and plan members ii require pbms to remit to clients or their plan members certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention andor iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to clients and their plan members to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities similarly credentialing organizations such as ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” may establish voluntary standards regarding pbm activities for example urac has issued pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark is currently accredited as a pbm by urac while the actions of these quasiregulatory or standardsetting organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for pbm services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan clients andor the services we provide to them 

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment the application of these common laws to pbms andor pbm activities could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms 

consumer protection laws  the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs in addition the ftca bars unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce the federal postal service act generally prohibits the mailing of and billing for unordered merchandise the ftc’s telemarketing sales rule also imposes extensive requirements and restrictions in connection with telemarketing which applies to plans or programs to induce the purchase of goods or services by consumers see the telemarketing and other outbound calls section below for further disclosures 

  

corporate integrity agreements  in september 2005 caremark’s subsidiary advancepcs now known as caremarkpcs llc entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government relating to certain alleged pbm business practices pursuant to which advancepcs agreed among other things to adhere to certain business practices pursuant to a consent order and to maintain a compliance program in accordance with a corporate integrity agreement entered into with the oig for a period of five years certain requirements of the advancepcs corporate integrity agreement are also applicable to our other pbm subsidiaries 

in march 2008 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government and a number of states related to the dispensing of the generic drug ranitidine at its retail pharmacies at the same time the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig for a period of five years applicable to certain retail and mail service operations of the company 

each corporate integrity agreement requires among other things maintenance of our compliance program employee training specific reviews by an independent review organization and various government reporting obligations failure to meet our obligations under these corporate integrity agreements could result in stipulated financial penalties and failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our applicable business from participation in federal health care programs 

contract audits  we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm client contracts our pharmacy provider agreements and our contracts relating to the medicare drug benefit audits are typically conducted pursuant to certain provisions in our contracts that grant audit rights and set forth applicable audit procedures because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate pdps or medicare advantage organizations under the mma the audits generally focus on among other things compliance with the applicable terms of our contracts and applicable legal requirements 

disease management services regulation  we provide or arrange for our customers to receive clinical services in the form of disease management programs for common and rare medical conditions nurses pharmacists and other clinicians as needed develop and implement these programs state laws regulate the practice of medicine the practice of pharmacy and the practice of nursing and clinicians engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

environmental regulation  our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities there is also an increased interest by regulators in better managing photo processing and pharmaceutical wastes we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency 

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

  

erisa fiduciaries may be held personally liable for entering into service contracts or arrangements like pbm contracts on behalf of erisa plans if the terms of the contract are not reasonable or if the service provider receives more than reasonable compensation for the services provided in such cases the service provider may also be required to disgorge any unreasonable compensation received and may be subject to civil penalties imposed by the us department of labor “dol” 

in november 2007 the dol announced final revisions to form 5500 and its related schedules effective for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2009 the revised form 5500 which most pension and welfare plans subject to erisa are required to file includes modifications to schedule c on which plans are required to report compensation paid to service providers 

in december 2009 the dol also announced a new project to promulgate regulations under section 408b2 of erisa the regulations which were previously issued in proposed form could require service providers including pbms to provide detailed disclosure regarding all direct and indirect compensation to be received in connection with the services to be provided as well as potential conflicts of interest 

we cannot be certain the extent to which newly issued disclosure regulations may apply to our business as the dol has provided very little final guidance regarding what constitutes reportable compensation under a pbm agreement 

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act “fca” which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 “fera” implemented substantial changes to the fca which expand the scope of fca liability provide for new investigative tools and make it easier for qui tam relators often referred to as “whistleblowers” to bring and maintain fca suits on behalf of the government some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section 

in addition federal and state governments have commenced numerous investigations of various pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers in recent years with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters the federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the fca by i improperly marketing and pricing drugs ii overstating the average wholesale prices of products iii paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs andor iv failing to accurately report “best price” under the medicaid program 

fda regulation  the united states food and drug administration “fda” generally has authority to regulate drugs drug classifications and drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer we have operated a fdaregulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed 

  

from our mail service pharmacies we intend to close this repackaging facility in april 2010 the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs 

formulary regulation  a number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the naic has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of the medicare drug benefit in july 2008 congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act which requires the secretary for hhs to identify certain classes and categories of drugs for which subject to certain exceptions all the drugs in any such class or category must be included in a part d plan’s formulary the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other clients 

managed care reform  proposed legislation has been considered on both the federal and state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan clients andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by congress and state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

medicare prescription drug benefit  the mma created the medicare drug benefit starting in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for the medicare drug benefit under medicare part d the mma also created a subsidy available to certain employer union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to part d coverage regulations implementing the medicare drug benefit include requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards other government rules and regulations which continue to evolve impact the funding available for medicare programs the marketing of part d services reporting of drug costs and administrative costs for the medicare drug benefit pbm contracting arrangements with retail pharmacies pharmaceutical manufacturers health plans or other parties related to the medicare drug benefit or retiree drug subsidy program and other terms and conditions affecting the medicare part d services we provide in january 2009 cms issued a regulation requiring that beginning in 2010 any difference between the drug price charged to medicare part d plan sponsors by a pbm and the drug price paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider commonly called “differential” or “spread” be reported as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost of the plan sponsor for purposes of calculating certain government subsidy payments and the drug price to be charged to enrollees the regulation also required that any rebates retained by the pbm must reduce the part d sponsor’s drug costs reported to the government regardless of the terms of the contract between the pbm and part d sponsor the regulation did not make either of these changes to the calculation of the plan sponsor’s drug costs under the retiree drug subsidy program which is a separate program under the mma but solicited comments on this issue cms has issued no further regulations or guidance on this issue to date however in both the house and senatepassed health reform bills currently 

  

being considered by congress the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment would be eliminated the senate bill hr 3590 would make this change effective in 2011 and the house bill hr 3962 beginning in 2013 

in october 2009 cms issued proposed regulations affecting various aspects of the part d program among other things the proposed regulations give cms greater latitude to limit the number of part d plans available by allowing it to eliminate plans with persistently low enrollment and plans that it views as poor performers based on certain cms performance criteria it also shortens the period for part d sponsors that acquire other part d plans to merge the plans or otherwise change them so that their plan offerings remain substantially different the proposed rule would also limit the period for coordination of benefits to three years for all payers currently the threeyear period applies only to coordination of benefits with medicaid plans 

the mma also requires that part d sponsors support electronic prescribing and comply with electronic prescribing standards issued by cms while electronic prescribing is voluntary for pharmacies and prescribers those pharmacies and prescribers that choose to conduct any of the electronic prescribing transactions are required to do so using the cms standards including standards for formulary and benefit transactions medication history transactions and fill status notification the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 pub l 111–5 “arra” which was signed into law in february 2009 amended the social security act to establish incentive payments to eligible professionals and hospitals participating in the medicare or medicaid program that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health records “ehr” technology beginning in 2011 arra also provides for downward payment adjustments beginning in 2015 for providers in the medicare program that fail to adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr technology among the measures of meaningful use is the use of electronic prescribing a proposed rule to implement the ehr incentive program was issued in december 2009 and requires that 75 of permissible prescriptions be sent electronically in order to qualify for the incentive payments 

the medicare drug benefit continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in the medicare drug benefit and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d sponsor for each type of pharmacy in its network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our clients or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm clients such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

pharmacy licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of 

  

controlled substances and listed chemical products and medical and controlled substance waste disposal federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies distribution centers and repackaging facility with the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control personnel and labeling standards in order to possess and dispense controlled substances and listed chemical products 

we also are subject to regulation by the dea and state pharmacy boards in connection with our online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods numerous state laws also exist affecting our receipt and processing of electronic prescription drug orders 

certain violations of the federal controlled substances laws can subject the company its pharmacies and distribution centers and individual pharmacy personnel to criminal and civil penalties and can also result in administrative action by the dea including suspension or revocation of a pharmacy’s or distribution center’s registration to distribute controlled substances andor listed chemical products state authorities and state boards of pharmacy similarly have the authority to impose both monetary penalties and disciplinary sanctions including revocation of a pharmacy’s or individual pharmacist’s license to dispense controlled substances and these penalties and sanctions are in addition to sanctions imposed under the federal controlled substances laws certain violations of these federal and state legal requirements can also trigger other consequences for the company’s business and could potentially impact our eligibility to participate in federal health care programs see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the ftc requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail and state licensing authorities may restrict the types of personnel who may work in mail service operations 

our pharmacists and technicians are subject to state regulation of the profession of pharmacy and our employees who are engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing or registration requirements and comply with applicable professional standards failure to comply with these regulations could subject our licenses and permits and our employee licenses to disciplinary action including fines suspensions andor revocations 

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan member may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic interchange requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our clients generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies or for use of certain health care providers legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our clients and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

  

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of confidential health information including disclosure of the confidential information to a member’s health benefit plan as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws in addition we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” including requirements to protect the integrity availability and confidentiality of electronic phi hipaa gives individuals the right to know how their phi is used and disclosed the right to access amend and obtain information concerning certain disclosures of phi covered entities such as pharmacies and health plans are required to provide a written notice of privacy practices to individuals that describes how the entity uses and discloses phi and how individuals may exercise their rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain a valid written individual authorization in most cases use or disclosure of phi must be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

hipaa also established national standards for conducting certain health care transactions electronically known as “standard transactions” as well as national identifiers for employers and health care providers the national provider identifier “npi” rule requires that all health care providers that conduct standard transactions obtain an npi and that the npi be used in any standard transaction where that health care provider’s identifier is required following the issuance of the npi rule certain states such as wisconsin and minnesota have enacted laws related to a prescriber’s dea number these state laws generally prohibit the use of a prescriber’s dea number for purposes other than in connection with the prescribing of a controlled substance 

in response to concerns about identity theft many states have passed security breach notification laws including laws requiring notification to consumers of security breaches involving personal information these laws generally require an entity conducting business in the state to notify consumers when their personal information has been or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person in some cases the law applies only to unencrypted computerized information but in others it applies to personal information in any form in addition to requiring notification to the affected individuals without unreasonable delay many state laws also require notification to government agencies such as the state attorney general or consumer protection agencies 

in january 2009 we entered into separate settlement agreements with the ftc and the hhs office for civil rights “ocr” resolving a joint investigation prompted by 2006 media reports of disposal of patient information in dumpsters at a limited number of cvspharmacy locations as part of the ftc settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate enterprisewide information security policies and procedures during the twenty year term of the agreement the ftc settlement also provides for periodic compliance monitoring by an external assessor as part of the ocr settlement we agree to maintain appropriate waste disposal policies and procedures training and employee sanctions at our retail stores the ocr settlement has a three year term and provides for annual compliance monitoring by an external assessor 

in february 2009 the president signed arra into law which includes provisions relating to health information technology activities such as eprescribing and electronic health records and contains revisions to existing federal privacy law the privacy law changes include new restrictions on the use of phi without an individual’s written authorization a new requirement to account for routine disclosures of phi held in an electronic health record a requirement to notify individuals of breaches to their phi new enforcement rights of state attorneys 

  

general extension of the federal privacy and security law provisions and penalties to business associates of covered entities and increased penalties for violations of the law since several of the provisions contemplate future adoption of implementing regulations we cannot at this time determine the extent to which these changes may apply to or impact our business 

reimbursement  a portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws discussed elsewhere in this section sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs as well as employers that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy 

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark in conjunction with a class action settlement implemented in september 2009 involving first databank “fdb” and medispan two entities that publish the awp of pharmaceuticals the methodology used to calculate awp was modified in a manner that reduced awp for many brand drugs and some generic drugs we have reached understandings with most of our pbm clients and other third party payors to adjust reimbursements to account for this change in methodology but most state medicaid programs that utilize awp as a pricing reference have not taken action to make similar adjustments as a result we expect reduced medicaid reimbursement levels in 2010 for certain products in addition both fdb and medispan have indicated that they intend to discontinue the publishing of awp altogether in the future most likely in september 2011 as a result we believe the pharmaceutical industry will be evaluating andor developing an alternative pricing reference to replace awp we will continue to work with our pbm clients and other payors to anticipate and mitigate the impact of possible future changes to applicable references for pricing pharmaceuticals 

under the mma the average sales price “asp” has replaced awp as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b for single source drugs the payment equals 106 percent of the lesser of i the wholesale acquisition cost “wac” of the product or ii the asp of the product asp is the weighted average of a manufacturer’s sales to all purchasers in a given quarter after certain pricing adjustments such as discounts or rebates and excluding sales to certain government and other purchasers 

further the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 151 of the average manufacturer price “amp” paid by wholesalers for products distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade or b the difference between amp and the “best price” available to essentially any client other than the medicaid program with certain exceptions investigations have been commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers 

  

in 2005 the dra was signed into law by the president the dra sought to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs these changes were expected to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing provisions under the dra regarding prescription drugs under the medicaid program among other things the rule defines amp and “best price” and specifies the items that must be included and excluded in the calculation of each the “amp rule” in october 2008 approximately ten months after the us district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing relevant portions of the amp rule cms issued a rule subject to comment which modified the definition of multiple source drugs a component of the amp calculation the proposed rule seeks to address one of the legal challenges on which the injunction was issued however opponents of this new rule have asserted that the revised definition continues to be inconsistent with the dra in the event health care reform legislation is adopted such legislation will likely include a provision to correct the definitional issues with the amp as a result of the above we cannot predict the extent or timing of implementation of the amp rule its effect on medicaid reimbursement or its impact on the company 

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

changes in reporting of awp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification in the past under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us in september 2006 congress expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new or pending health legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

retail clinics  states also regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states 

  

have implemented or proposed laws that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage third party contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation of our owned and managed retail clinics 

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid program exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

state insurance laws  feeforservice prescription drug plans and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guaranties or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

our silverscript and accendo pdps each must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under applicable state laws or they must have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms both silverscript and accendo are licensed in all states in which they offer pdps and do not operate under any part d waivers as licensed insurance companies silverscript and accendo and their agents are subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial licensing and operational reports pursuant to the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps but the application of other state laws to the medicare drug benefit are generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our clients or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that 

  

supplement the medicare drug benefit payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner part d plans are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps have also received permission from cms to autoassign their enrollees that do not choose their own medicare part d plans into pdps 

telemarketing and other outbound calls  certain federal and state laws give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound calls these laws may require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when consumers may be called require consumer consent prior to being called require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services and require the retention of specific business records 

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the fca contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance 

we can give no assurance however that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business or the pharmacy services or retail industry iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services or retail industry iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services or retail industry

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns these changes could affect drug utilization trends as well as the financial health and number of covered lives of our pbm clients resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in that regard the economic recession resulted in declining drug utilization trends during 2008 and 2009 although a recovery might be underway it is possible that a worsening of the economic environment will cause further decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores if this were to occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms 

inability to realize the benefits of the caremark merger 

we may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated longterm strategic benefits of the caremark merger an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock 

inability to realize the benefits of the acquisition of longs drug stores corporation 

we may not be able to realize the planned benefits associated with the october 2008 acquisition of the longs drug stores corporation in accordance with the expected timing 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement 

  

rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may affect health care financing and reimbursement practices if the current health care financing and reimbursement system changes significantly the company’s business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in 2005 the dra was signed into law by the president the dra sought to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs these changes were expected to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing provisions under the dra regarding prescription drugs under the medicaid program among other things the rule defines amp and “best price” and the amp rule in october 2008 approximately ten months after the us district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing relevant portions of the amp rule cms issued a rule subject to comment which modified the definition of multiple source drugs a component of the amp calculation the proposed rule seeks to address one of the legal challenges on which the injunction was issued however opponents of this new rule have asserted that the revised definition continues to be inconsistent with the dra in the event health care reform legislation is adopted such legislation will likely include a provision to correct the definitional issues with the amp as a result of the above we cannot predict the extent or timing of implementation of the amp rule its effect on medicaid reimbursement or its impact on the company 

the possibility of pbm client loss andor the failure to win new pbm business may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members pbm client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration so approximately one third of a pbm’s client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some cases however pbm clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract therefore we face challenges in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing pbm business although none of our pbm clients represented more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2009 our top 10 clients are expected to represent approximately 29 of such revenues in 2010 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms in that regard during 2009 a small number of large client accounts elected not to renew their contractual relationships with the company effective in 2010 our failure to renew or win pbm business could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products 

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our national retail network and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused caremark and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive accordingly margin pressure in the pbm industry resulting from these trends could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

regulatory and business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d may adversely affect our business financial position and our results of operations 

since its inception in 2006 the medicare drug benefit has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of the medicare drug benefit our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of the medicare drug benefit may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit in addition if the cost and complexity of the medicare drug benefit exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare drug benefit and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of the medicare drug benefit or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the medicare drug benefit’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be materially and adversely affected and our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in that regard in january 2009 cms issued a regulation requiring that beginning in 2010 any difference between the drug price charged to medicare part d plan sponsors by a pbm and the drug paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider commonly called “differential” or “spread” be reported as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost of the plan sponsor for purposes of calculating certain government subsidy payments and the drug price to be charged to enrollees these changes impact our ability to offer medicare part d plan sponsors pricing for 2010 that includes the use of retail network “differential” or “spread” and we expect these changes to reduce the profitability of our medicare part d business beginning in 2010 

changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

implementation of the fdb and medispan settlements described in the government regulation section have resulted in changes in the methodology used to calculate awp which is the pricing reference used for many of our pbm client contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in addition both fdb and medispan have indicated that they intend to discontinue the publishing of awp altogether in the future most likely in september 2011 as a result we believe the pharmaceutical industry will be evaluating andor developing an alternative pricing reference to replace awp 

  

future changes to the use of awp or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs andor other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid programs the reimbursement we receive from pbm clients and other payors andor our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers wholesalers pbms and retail pharmacies the effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time 

the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pbm business currently operates in a highly competitive environment as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

competitors in the pbm industry include large national pbm companies such as medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg unitedhealthcare aetna and cigna and retail pharmacies eg walgreens which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we even if the anticipated benefits of our merger are realized in full may not be able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

efforts to reform the us health care system may adversely affect our financial performance and the services we provide 

congress periodically considers proposals to reform the us health care system this is especially the case today as congress considers major health reform legislation that could affect the entire health insurance system and virtually every aspect of health care in the country if adopted this legislation andor other proposals may increase government involvement in health care and regulation of pbm or pharmacy services or otherwise change the way the company or its clients do business health plan sponsors may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the company would provide the company cannot predict what effect if any these proposals may have on its retail and pharmacy services businesses other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that the company cannot anticipate could also have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

existing and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the pbm business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business – government regulation” changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to 

  

the laws and regulations described in the government regulation section accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and regulations of the fda the ftc the dea and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be affected by one or more of the following

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cvs caremark corporation “cvs caremark” the “company” “we” or “us” is the largest provider of prescriptions and related health care services in the united states we fill or manage more than one billion prescriptions annually as a fully integrated pharmacy services company we drive value for our customers by effectively managing pharmaceutical costs and improving health care outcomes through our approximately 6900 cvspharmacy ® and longs drug ® retail stores our pharmacy benefit management mail order and specialty pharmacy division caremark pharmacy services ®  our retailbased health clinic subsidiary minuteclinic ®  and our online pharmacy cvscom ®  we currently operate two business segments pharmacy services and retail pharmacy our business segments are operating units that offer different products and services and require distinct technology and marketing strategies 

the caremark merger 

effective march 22 2007 we closed our merger with caremark rx inc the “caremark merger” following the caremark merger we changed our name to cvs caremark corporation and caremark rx inc became a whollyowned subsidiary caremark rx llc “caremark” the caremark merger has positioned our company to deliver significant benefits to i health plan sponsors through effective cost management solutions and innovative programs and ii consumers through expanded choice improved access and more personalized services 

the caremark merger has enabled us to achieve significant synergies from purchasing scale and operating efficiencies the purchasing synergies include additional purchase discounts including rebates obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturers and cost efficiencies obtained from our national network of retail pharmacies operating synergies include cost savings resulting from productivity increases and other efficiencies obtained by eliminating duplicate facilities and excess capacity and combining complementary operations 

the caremark merger has also created significant incremental revenue opportunities for our company through a variety of new programs and plan designs that benefit from our client relationships our integrated information systems and the ability of our more than 25000 pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants to interact personally with the millions of consumers who shop our stores every day in that regard during 2008 we introduced proactive pharmacy care™ an earlier easier more effective approach to engaging plan participants in behaviors that can help lower costs improve health and save lives examples of proactive pharmacy care programs include maintenance choice™ a flexible fulfillment option that affords eligible plan participants the convenient choice of picking up their 90day supply of maintenance medications at any cvspharmacy store or obtaining them through mail order in either case at the cost of mail for both the payer and the plan participant bridge supply which enables eligible plan participants to avoid gaps in care while waiting for their medications to arrive in the mail by obtaining a bridge supply of their prescriptions at any cvspharmacy store at no additional charge and a new extracare ® health card program which offers discounts to eligible plan participants on certain flexible spending accounteligible and overthecounter health care products sold in any of our cvspharmacy stores we are also creating new compliance and persistency programs designed to ensure that patients take their medications in the correct manner as well as enhanced disease management programs that are targeted at managing chronic disease states in addition we are working with our clients to i decrease unnecessary and expensive emergency room visits by encouraging plan participants to use our minuteclinic locations for everyday common ailments and ii create pilot programs that offer convenient unique services available at minuteclinic such as injection training for specialty pharmacy patients 

while certain of these programs like maintenance choice bridge supply and the extracare health card program have already been adopted by many cvs caremark clients others are still in the formative stage and require additional information system enhancements andor changes in work processes accordingly over the longterm there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of incremental revenues that can be achieved with these kinds of programs 

we believe the breadth of capabilities resulting from the caremark merger are resonating with our clients and contributed to our success at renewing existing clients and obtaining a significant number of new clients in the 2008 selling season 

  

the longs acquisition 

effective october 20 2008 we acquired longs drug stores corporation which includes 529 retail drug stores the “longs drug stores” and rxamerica llc “rxamerica” which provides pharmacy benefit management services and certain other related assets collectively the “longs acquisition” 

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services business provides a full range of prescription benefit management “pbm” services including mail order pharmacy services specialty pharmacy services plan design and administration formulary management and claims processing our customers are primarily employers insurance companies unions government employee groups managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in addition through our silverscript insurance company “silverscript” and accendo insurance company “accendo” subsidiaries we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government’s medicare part d program currently the pharmacy services business operates under the caremark pharmacy services ®  caremark ®  cvs caremark™ careplus cvspharmacy™ careplus™ rxamerica ®  accordantcare ® and theracom ® names as of december 31 2008 the pharmacy services segment operated 58 retail specialty pharmacy stores 19 specialty mail order pharmacies and 7 mail service pharmacies located in 26 states puerto rico and the district of columbia 

our strategy  our business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality customer service in order to enhance clinical outcomes for the participants in our customers’ health benefit plans while assisting our customers in better managing their overall health care costs we believe the caremark merger has positioned our company to deliver significant benefits to health plan sponsors through effective costmanagement solutions and innovative programs and to consumers through expanded choice improved access and more personalized services 

our services  the pbm services we provide for our customers involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the cost and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use these services are described more fully below 

plan design and administration  our customers sponsor pharmacy benefit plans which facilitate the ability of eligible participants in these plans to receive medications prescribed by their physicians we assist our customers in designing pharmacy benefit plans that minimize the costs to the customer while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the customers’ participants we also administer these benefit plans for our customers and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent informal communications as well as through a formal annual customer review 

we make recommendations to our customers encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug we believe that we help our customers control costs by recommending plans that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our customers also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different participant payment levels for different products on our drug lists 

formulary management  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure participant access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the customer’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for participants and customers we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug list and generic equivalent products as well as of our clinical programs 

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and these negotiated discounts enable us to offer reduced costs to customers that choose to adopt our drug lists the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for our receiving discounts from established list prices in one or a combination of the forms in that regard these discounts generally take the form of a direct discount at the time of purchase a discount for prompt payment of 

  

invoices or when products are indirectly purchased from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacychain a retroactive discount or rebate we also receive additional discounts under our wholesale contracts if we exceed contractuallydefined annual purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues 

prescription management systems  we dispense prescription drugs both directly through our own pharmacies and indirectly through a network of retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating tests for various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

mail pharmacy program  we currently operate 7 large automated mail service pharmacies in the continental united states including one located in largo florida that we expect to consolidate during 2009 our customers or their physicians submit prescriptions primarily for maintenance medications to these pharmacies via mail telephone fax or the internet we also operate a network of smaller mail service specialty pharmacies described below additionally we operate a united states food and drug administration “fda” regulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription amounts dispensed from our automated mail service pharmacies our staff pharmacists review mail service prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems this review may involve communications with the prescribing physician and with the physician’s approval can result in generic substitution therapeutic interchange or other actions to affect cost or to improve quality of treatment in these cases we inform participants about the changes made to their prescriptions

information systems  we currently operate primary information systems platforms to support our pbm services which are supplemented by additional information systems to support our pharmacy operations these information systems incorporate integrated architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other customer service contracts 

customers  our customers are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans employers unions government employee groups insurance companies and managed care organizations and individuals located throughout the united states we provide pharmaceuticals to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers and utilize our information systems to perform safety checks drug interaction screening and generic substitution we generate substantially all of our pharmacy services segment net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers during the yearended december 31 2008 we managed over 633 million prescriptions for individuals from over 3300 organizations 

competition  we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to customers’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to customers and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to customers and their participants the pharmacy services segment competes with a number of large national pbm companies including medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many smaller local or regional pbms we also compete with several large health insurersmanaged care plans eg unitedhealthcare wellpoint aetna cigna and retail pharmacies which have their own pbm capabilities as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours 

retail pharmacy segment 

as of december 31 2008 the retail pharmacy segment included 6923 retail drugstores of which 6857 operated a pharmacy our online retail website cvscom ® and our retail health care clinics the retail drugstores are located in 41 states and the district of columbia operating primarily under the cvspharmacy ®  or longs drug ® names we currently operate in 89 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 60 of these markets overall we hold the number one or number two market share position in 67 of the markets in which our retail drugstores operate cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise which we refer to as “front store” products existing stores range in size from approximately 8000 to 25000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 10000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during fiscal 2008 we filled approximately 559 million retail prescriptions or approximately 17 of the us retail pharmacy market 

as of december 31 2008 we operated 560 retail health care clinics in 27 states under the minuteclinic name of which 534 were located within cvspharmacy stores the clinics utilize nationally recognized medical protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions and are staffed by boardcertified nurse practitioners and physician assistants 

  

our strategy  our goal is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

our products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows 

 

  

 pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented approximately 68 of retail pharmacy revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products the federally funded prescription drug benefit promulgated in 2006 as part of the mma and our on going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology as such our pharmacy service initiative which is designed to resolve potential problems at the point of dropoff that could delay a prescription being filled has enabled us to improve our dispensing process resulting in improved customer service ratings further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our rx connect system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  cvspharmacy health savings pass proactive pharmacy care tm  and our online business cvscom 

front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base in addition the extracare program is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states the extracare program allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ® rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 3300 cvs brand and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 15 of our front store revenues during 2008 

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2008 we opened 188 new retail pharmacy stores and 2 new specialty pharmacy stores acquired 529 stores as part of the longs acquisition relocated 129 retail pharmacy stores and 3 specialty pharmacy stores and closed 39 stores during the last five years we opened 

  

more than 1300 new and relocated stores and acquired approximately 2500 stores more than twothirds of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2009 we expect to open between 250 and 300 new or relocated stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill tm  which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone we continue to enhance our visible improvement in profits execution and results “viper” system a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to transactions processed through our pointofsale systems in addition we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking in addition in 2009 we plan on implementing a new pharmacy fulfillment system rx connect which will reengineer the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions further we continue to enhance our assisted inventory management system which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both increases instock positions in the stores and lowers our investment in inventory 

customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 96 of our 2008 pharmacy revenues since our revenues relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total revenues we also fill prescriptions for many government funded programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans 

seasonality  the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 64 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 which section is incorporated by reference herein 

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs health clinics and internet pharmacies 

working capital practices 

we fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper and longterm borrowings for additional information on our working capital practices we refer you to the caption “liquidity and capital resources” on page 29 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 which section is incorporated by reference herein the majority of our nonpharmacy revenues are in cash while managed care and other third party insurance programs which typically settle in less than 30 days represented approximately 98 of our consolidated pharmacy revenues in 2008 our customer returns are not significant 

associate development 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 215000 associates which included more than 25000 pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants in addition approximately 90000 associates were parttime employees who work less than 30 hours per week to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards we emphasize attracting and training knowledgeable friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores clinics and throughout our organization

government regulation of health care matters 

overview  as a participant in the health care industry our retail and pharmacy services businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern the purchase sale and distribution of prescription drugs and related services including administration and management of prescription drug benefits many of our pbm clients including insurers and managed care organizations “mcos” are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor the application of complex standards to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty moreover regulation of the health care industry continues to evolve and there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels many of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted we are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on us any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or any adverse applications of or changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

among the existing federal and state laws and regulations that affect aspects of our business are the following 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal health care programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services paid for with government funds state laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs the federal antiremuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts the office of inspector general the “oig” within the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and administrative bodies because of the federal statute’s broad scope hhs established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers certain personal services arrangements certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians and certain other transactions and relationships a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by hhs 

in april 2003 the oig issued a compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the “oig guidance” in the oig guidance the oig identifies potential risk areas for pharmaceutical manufacturers and also discusses a number of traditional relationships between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms such as discount payments service offerings and data sales and recommends that such relationships be structured wherever possible to fit within an applicable safe harbor 

the federal antiremuneration law has been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs additionally certain governmental entities have commenced investigations of companies in the pharmaceutical services industry and have identified issues concerning development of preferred drug lists therapeutic interchange programs pricing of pharmaceutical products and discounts from prescription drug manufacturers 

  

antitrust and unfair competition  numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states against pharmaceutical manufactures andor pbms under various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging among other things i brand drug pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers ii the maintenance of retail pharmacy networks by pbms and iii various other business practices of pbms to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

comprehensive pbm regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to customers and plan participants ii require pbms to remit to customers or their plan participants certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention andor iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to customers and their plan participants to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities and ncqa the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” or other credentialing organizations may provide voluntary standards regarding pbm activities in 2007 for example urac finalized pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark has been accredited as a pbm by urac while the actions of these quasiregulatory organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence customer requirements for pbm services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan customers andor the services we provide to them 

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment the application of these common laws to pbms andor pbm activities could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms 

consumer protection laws  the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs 

corporate integrity agreements  in september 2005 caremark’s subsidiary advancepcs now known as caremarkpcs llc entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government relating to certain alleged pbm business practices pursuant to which advancepcs agreed among other things to adhere to certain business practices pursuant to a consent order and to maintain a compliance program in accordance with a corporate integrity agreement entered into with the oig for a period of five years our pbm subsidiaries have agreed with limited exceptions to comply with the requirements of the corporate integrity agreement applicable to advancepcs 

in march 2008 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government and a number of states relating to dispensing of the generic drug ranitidine at its retail pharmacies at the same time the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig for a period of five years applicable to certain retail and mail service operations of the company 

each corporate integrity agreement requires among other things maintenance of our compliance program employee training specific reviews by an independent review organization and various government reporting obligations failure to meet our obligations under these corporate integrity agreements could result in stipulated financial penalties and failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our applicable business from participation in federal health care programs 

contract audits  we are subject to audits of many of our contracts including our pbm customer contracts our pharmacy provider agreements and our contracts relating to the medicare drug benefit audits are typically conducted 

  

pursuant to certain provisions in our contracts that grant audit rights and set forth applicable audit procedures because some of our contracts are with state or federal governments audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs including those which operate prescription drug plans or medicare advantage organizations under the mma the audits generally focus on among other things compliance with the applicable terms of our contracts and applicable legal requirements 

disease management services regulation  we provide customers with clinical services in the form of disease management programs and we employ nurses and other clinicians where needed to develop and implement our disease management programs all states regulate the practice of medicine and the practice of nursing and employees engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and benefit plans including private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa 

erisa fiduciaries may be held personally liable for entering into service contracts or arrangements like pbm contracts on behalf of erisa plans if the terms of the contract are not reasonable or if the service provider receives more than reasonable compensation for the services provided in such cases the service provider may also be required to disgorge any unreasonable compensation received and may be subject to civil penalties imposed by the us department of labor 

in december 2007 the department of labor issued comprehensive proposed regulations regarding when a service contract or arrangement with an erisa plan was reasonable if finalized in the form proposed the regulations could require service providers including pbms to provide detailed disclosure regarding all direct and indirect compensation to be received in connection with the services to be provided as well as potential conflicts of interest that could impact the provision of services by the service provider under the proposed regulations failure by the service provider to fully comply with these disclosure requirements would cause the contract to be unreasonable and to violate erisa significant comments were filed in response to the proposed regulations we cannot be certain when or if the proposed regulations will be finalized or the extent to which final regulations may apply to our business the regulations currently in effect provide very little guidance regarding what constitutes a reasonable contract or arrangement or reasonable compensation 

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from or limit reimbursement to a governmentsponsored program some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section 

in addition federal and state governments have commenced numerous investigations of various pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and health care providers in recent years with respect to false claims fraudulent 

  

billing and related matters the federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the federal false claims act by i improperly marketing and pricing drugs ii overstating the average wholesale prices of products iii paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs andor iv failing to accurately report “best price” under the medicaid program 

fda regulation  the fda generally has authority to regulate drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer we operate a fdaregulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs 

formulary regulation  a number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the naic has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners and could form the basis of state legislation the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of the medicare drug benefit in july 2008 congress enacted the medicare improvements for patients and providers act which requires the secretary for hhs to identify certain classes and categories of drugs for which subject to certain exceptions all the drugs in any such class or category must be included in a part d plan’s formulary the increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other customers 

managed care reform  proposed legislation has been considered on both the federal and state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan customers andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by congress and state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

medicare prescription drug benefit  the mma created the medicare drug benefit starting in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for the medicare drug benefit under medicare part d the mma also created a subsidy available to certain employer union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to part d coverage regulations implementing the medicare drug benefit include requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards other government rules and regulations which continue to evolve impact the funding available for medicare programs the marketing of part d services reporting of drug costs and administrative costs for the medicare drug benefit pbm contracting arrangements with retail pharmacies pharmaceutical manufacturers health plans or other parties related to the medicare drug benefit or retiree drug subsidy program and other terms and conditions affecting the medicare part d services we provide for instance in january 2009 cms issued a regulation with comment period addressing the calculation of drug costs under the medicare drug benefit and retiree drug subsidy program for the medicare drug benefit the regulation requires that beginning in 2010 any difference between the drug price charged to part d sponsors by a pbm and the drug price paid by the pbm to the dispensing provider be treated as an administrative cost rather than a drug cost to the part d sponsor for purposes of calculating both the subsidy payments by the government and the drug price to be charged to enrollees the regulation also requires that any rebates retained by the pbm must reduce the part d sponsor’s drug costs reported to the government regardless of the terms of the contract between the pbm and part d sponsor the regulation does not 

  

make either of these changes to the calculation of the plan sponsor’s drug costs under the retiree drug subsidy program but solicits comments on this issue 

the mma also requires that part d sponsors support electronic prescribing and comply with electronic prescribing standards issued by cms while electronic prescribing is voluntary for pharmacies and prescribers those pharmacies and prescribers that choose to conduct any of the electronic prescribing transactions are required to do so using the cms standards including standards for formulary and benefit transactions medication history transactions and fill status notification 

the medicare drug benefit continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve accordingly it is possible that legislative and regulatory developments could materially affect our medicare part d business or profitability 

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our customers to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in the medicare drug benefit and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d sponsor for each type of pharmacy in its network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our customers or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm customers such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

pharmacy licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substances and medical waste disposal federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and our repackaging facility with the united states drug enforcement administration and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances 

we also are subject to certain federal and state laws affecting online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods several states have proposed new laws to regulate online pharmacies and federal regulation of online pharmacies by the fda or another federal agency has also been proposed 

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the federal trade commission “ftc” requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail 

our pharmacists are subject to state regulation of the profession of pharmacy and our employees who are engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing or registration requirements 

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed 

  

care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan participant may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic interchange requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our customers generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies or for use of certain health care providers legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our customers and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

privacy and confidentiality requirements  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of confidential health information including disclosure of the confidential information to a participant’s health benefit plan as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws in addition we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans health care providers health care clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” including requirements to protect the integrity availability and confidentiality of electronic phi hipaa gives individuals the right to know how their phi is used and disclosed the right to access amend and obtain information concerning certain disclosures of phi covered entities such as pharmacies and health plans are required to provide a written notice of privacy practices to individuals that describes how the entity uses and discloses phi and how individuals may exercise their rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment health care operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain a valid written individual authorization in most cases use or disclosure of phi must be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

hipaa also established national standards for conducting certain health care transactions electronically known as “standard transactions” as well as national identifiers for employers and health care providers the national provider identifier “npi” rule requires that all health care providers that conduct standard transactions obtain an npi and that the npi be used in any standard transaction where that health care provider’s identifier is required following the issuance of the npi rule certain states such as wisconsin and minnesota have enacted laws related to a prescriber’s drug enforcement administration “dea” number these state laws generally prohibit the use of a prescriber’s dea number for purposes other than in connection with the prescribing of a controlled substance 

in response to concerns about identity theft many states have passed security breach notification laws including laws requiring notification to consumers of security breaches involving personal information these laws generally require an entity conducting business in the state to notify consumers when their personal information has been or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person in some cases the law applies only to unencrypted computerized information but in others it applies to personal information in any form in addition to requiring notification to the affected individuals without unreasonable delay many state laws also require notification to government agencies such as the state attorney general or consumer protection agencies 

in january 2009 we entered into separate settlement agreements with the ftc and the hhs office for civil rights “ocr” resolving a joint investigation prompted by 2006 media reports of disposal of patient information in dumpsters at a limited number of cvspharmacy locations as part of the ftc settlement we agreed to maintain appropriate enterprisewide information security policies and procedures during the twenty year term of the agreement the ftc settlement also provides for periodic compliance monitoring by an external assessor as part of the ocr settlement we agree to maintain appropriate waste disposal policies and procedures training and employee sanctions at our retail stores the ocr settlement has a three year term and provides for annual compliance monitoring by an external assessor 

  

on february 2009 the president signed into law economic stimulus legislation known as the “american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009” which includes provisions relating to health information technology activities such as eprescribing and electronic health records and contains revisions to existing federal privacy law the privacy law changes include new restrictions on the use of phi without an individual’s written authorization a new requirement to account for routine disclosures of phi held in an electronic health record a requirement to notify individuals of breaches to their phi new enforcement rights of state attorneys general extension of the federal privacy and security law provisions and penalties to business associates of covered entities and increased penalties for violations of the law since several of the provisions contemplate future adoption of implementing regulations we cannot at this time determine the extent to which these changes may apply to or impact our business 

reimbursement  a portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws discussed elsewhere in this section sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government health care programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored health care programs as well as employers that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy 

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our customer contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark first databank “fdb” one of two primary sources of awp price reporting and medispan the other primary source of awp price reporting have entered into proposed settlement agreements relating to their awp reporting which remain subject to final court approval under the terms of the proposed settlement agreements fdb and medispan have agreed to reduce the reported awp of certain drugs by four percent in addition although not required by the proposed settlement agreements fdb and medispan have indicated that they intend to reduce the reported awp for a substantial number of drugs not covered by the settlement and that they intend to discontinue the publishing of awp in the future the proposed settlements have not yet received final court approval so the timing of their implementation if approved is uncertain we have provisions in many of our contracts designed to enable us to mitigate the impact of the proposed awp reduction or other possible changes to pricing benchmarks but we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate effect of these changes on our business relationships 

under the mma the average sales price “asp” has replaced awp as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b for single source drugs the payment will equal 106 percent of the lesser of i the wholesale acquisition cost “wac” of the product or ii the asp of the product asp is the weighted average of a manufacturer’s sales to all purchasers in a given quarter after certain pricing adjustments such as discounts or rebates and excluding sales to certain government and other purchasers 

further the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 151 of the average manufacturer price “amp” paid by wholesalers for products distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade or b the difference between amp and the “best price” available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program with certain exceptions investigations have been commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers 

during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing provisions under the dra regarding prescription drugs under the medicaid program among other things the rule defines amp and “best price” and specifies the items that must be included and excluded in the calculation of each “amp rule” under the amp rule which became effective october 1 

  

2007 sales to mail pharmacies would be included in the calculation of amp but rebates and other discounts negotiated by pbms in their capacity as pbms would be excluded the rule also implements the dra provision establishing a new reimbursement formula for generic drugs under medicaid and establishes federal upper limits “fuls” for generics based on 250 percent of the lowest amp in a given drug class in december 2007 the us district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing the amp rule to the extent such action affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies and from posting online or disclosing any amp data in october 2008 cms issued a rule subject to comment which modified the definition of multiple source drugs a component of the amp calculation seeking to address one of the legal challenges on which the injunction was issued plaintiffs in the litigation responded with an amended complaint asserting that the revised definition continues to be inconsistent with the dra 

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

changes in reporting of awp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts or rebates with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification in the past under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us in september 2006 congress expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

retail clinics  states also regulate retail clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight lab licensing and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine a number of states have implemented or proposed laws that impact certain components of retail clinic operations such as physician oversight signage thirdparty contracting requirements bathroom facilities and scope of services these laws and regulations may affect the operation of our owned and managed retail clinics 

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid program 

  

exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

state insurance laws  feeforservice prescription drug plans and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guaranties or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

our silverscript and accendo medicare part d prescription drug plans each must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under applicable state laws or they must have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms as licensed insurance companies silverscript and accendo are subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial and operational reports if silverscript or accendo is unable either to acquire all necessary insurance licenses or to maintain waivers of such licensing requirements there may be a materially adverse impact on their ability to participate in the medicare drug benefit as pdps pursuant to the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps but the application of other state laws to the medicare drug benefit are generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our customers or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that supplement the medicare drug benefit payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner part d plans are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps have also received permission from cms to autoassign their enrollees that do not choose their own medicare part d plans into pdps we have been and continue to be in active discussions with spaps to coordinate benefits with our medicare drug benefit offerings and where applicable enrollment by spap members into our pdps 

telemarketing and other outbound calls  certain federal and state laws give the ftc federal communications commission and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound calls these laws may require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when consumers may be called require consumer consent prior to being called require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services and require the retention of specific business records 

  

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the federal false claims act contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance 

we can give no assurance however that our business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices based on i future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations ii the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations including the laws and regulations described in this government regulation section as they may relate to our business or the retail or pharmacy services industry iii pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services industry iv institution of government enforcement actions against us v adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us whether sealed or unsealed or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us or vi adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services industry

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

  

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns these changes could affect drug utilization trends as well as the financial health and number of covered lives of our pbm clients resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in that regard the current economic recession has resulted in declining drug utilization trends during 2008 and 2009 it is possible that a worsening of these trends will cause further decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services as well as consumer demand for products sold in our retail stores if this were to occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions under acceptable terms 

inability to realize the benefits of the caremark merger 

we may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated longterm strategic benefits of the caremark merger an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock 

inability to integrate and realize the benefits of the longs acquisition 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the assets acquired in the longs acquisition an inability to achieve the full extent of or any of the anticipated synergies could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices could adversely affect our businesses 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations other pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate in addition during the past several years the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control health care costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may affect health care financing and reimbursement practices if the current health care financing and reimbursement system changes significantly the combined company’s business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the dra seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs according to the congressional budget office retail pharmacies are expected to negotiate with individual states for higher dispensing fees to mitigate the adverse effect of these changes these changes were expected to begin to take effect in 2007 and to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing the new reimbursement formula subsequent to issuance of this rule a group of retail pharmacy industry trade groups filed suit in federal district court seeking to enjoin cms from implementing the rule in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing the final rule to the extent such action affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies in october 2008 cms issued a rule which modified the definition of multisource drugs seeking to address one of the legal challenges on which the injunction was issued plaintiffs in the litigation responded with an amended complaint asserting that the revised definition continues to be inconsistent with the dra accordingly the timing and extent of any reductions and the impact on the company cannot be determined at this time 

  

the possibility of customer loss andor the failure to win new business may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan participants pbm client contracts generally have terms approximating 3 years in duration accordingly approximately one third of a pbm’s customer base typically is subject to renewal each year and therefore we face challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business although none of our pbm clients represented more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2008 our top 10 clients are expected to represent approximately 30 of such revenues in 2009 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms accordingly our failure to renew or win pbm business could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of new prescription drugs as well as generic alternatives to brand name prescription products 

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our national retail network including cvspharmacy and longs drug stores and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused caremark and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive accordingly margin pressure in the pbm industry resulting from these trends could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

uncertainty regarding the impact of medicare part d may adversely affect our business financial position and our results of operations 

since its inception in 2006 the medicare drug benefit has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of the medicare drug benefit our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members to the extent this occurs the adverse effects of the medicare drug benefit may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit in addition if the cost and complexity of the medicare drug benefit exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for medicare drug benefit and retiree drug subsidy purposes are implemented in a manner that impacts the profitability of our medicare part d business if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of the medicare drug benefit or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the medicare drug benefit’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be materially and adversely affected and our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including caremark’s network contracts and its pbm and specialty client contracts generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include awp asp and wac most of our pbm client contracts utilize the awp standard further most of the contracts governing the participation of cvspharmacy stores in retail pharmacy networks also utilize the awp standard 

recent events including the proposed fdb and medispan settlements described in the government regulation of health care matters section have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry 

changes in reporting of awp or in the basis for calculating reimbursement proposed by the federal government and certain states and other legislative or regulatory adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of payments for drugs by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate rebates andor discounts with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits in addition it is possible that payors pharmacy providers and pbms will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and pbm services in the future and the effect of this development on the business of the company cannot be predicted at this time 

the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pbm business currently operates in a highly competitive environment as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in that regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

competitors in the pbm industry include large national pbm companies such as medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg unitedhealthcare wellpoint aetna cigna and retail pharmacies eg walgreens which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we even if the anticipated benefits of our merger are realized in full may not be able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

existing and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

the pbm business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business – government regulation of health care matters” changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation of health care matters section accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management 

  

and disposal of hazardous substances and regulations of the fda the us federal trade commission the drug enforcement administration and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be affected by one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

pharmacy services and retail pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries our company is currently subject to various litigation matters and legal proceedings resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as such we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

efforts to reform the us health care system may adversely affect our financial performance 

congress periodically considers proposals to reform the us health care system these proposals may increase government involvement in health care and regulation of pbm or pharmacy services or otherwise change the way the combined company or its clients do business health plan sponsors may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the combined company would provide the company cannot predict what effect if any these proposals may have on its retail and pharmacy services businesses other legislative or marketdriven changes in the health care system that the company cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect the combined company’s consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position andor consolidated cash flow from operations 

the foregoing is not a comprehensive listing and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business as such we refer you to the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which includes our “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” at the end of such section on pages 18 through 36 of our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 which section is incorporated by reference

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cvs caremark corporation “cvs caremark” the “company” “we” or “us” is the largest provider of prescriptions and related healthcare services in the united states we fill or manage more than one billion prescriptions annually as a fully integrated pharmacy services company we drive value for our customers by effectively managing pharmaceutical costs and improving healthcare outcomes through our approximately 6200 cvspharmacy ® retail stores our pharmacy benefit management mail order and specialty pharmacy division caremark pharmacy services our retailbased health clinic subsidiary minuteclinic ®  and our online pharmacy cvscom ®  we currently operate two business segments retail pharmacy and pharmacy services our business segments are operating units that offer different products and services and require distinct technology and marketing strategies 

the caremark merger 

effective march 22 2007 we closed our merger with caremark rx inc “caremark” following the caremark merger we changed our name to “cvs caremark corporation” 

we believe cvs and caremark are complementary companies and the merger is expected to yield benefits for health plan sponsors through more effective costmanagement solutions and innovative programs and for consumers through expanded choice improved access and more personalized services we also believe we can operate the combined companies more efficiently than either company could have operated on its own in that regard the merger has enabled us to achieve significant synergies from purchasing scale and operating efficiencies purchasing synergies are largely comprised of purchase discounts andor rebates obtained from generic and brand name drug manufacturers and cost efficiencies obtained from our retail pharmacy networks operating synergies include decreases in overhead expense increases in productivity and efficiencies obtained by eliminating excess capacity decreases in prescription dispensing costs and other benefits made possible by combining complementary operations 

over the longer term we expect the caremark merger will also create significant incremental revenue opportunities these opportunities are expected to be derived from a variety of new programs and benefit designs that leverage our client relationships our integrated information systems and the personal interaction of our more than 20000 pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants with the millions of consumers who shop our stores on a daily basis examples of these programs include new prescription compliance and persistency programs enhanced disease management programs new extracare card programs for plan beneficiaries increased use of minuteclinics by plan beneficiaries and flexible fulfillment options that afford plan beneficiaries the opportunity to pickup maintenance medications instore while certain of these programs will commence in 2008 many are in their formative stage and require significant information system enhancements as well as changes in work processes accordingly there can be no assurance as to the timing of the implementation of or the amount of incremental revenues associated with these kinds of programs 

retail pharmacy segment 

as of december 29 2007 the retail pharmacy segment included 6245 retail drugstores of which 6164 operated a pharmacy our online retail website cvscom ® and our retail healthcare clinics the retail drugstores are located in 40 states and the district of columbia operating under the cvs ® or cvspharmacy ® names we currently operate in 77 of the top 100 us drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 58 of these markets overall we hold the number one or number two market share position in 75 of the markets in which our retail drugstores operate cvspharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise including overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics photo finishing seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods which we refer to as “front store” products existing stores generally range in size from approximately 8000 to 18000 square feet although most new stores range in size from approximately 10000 to 13000 square feet and typically include a drivethru pharmacy during fiscal 2007 we filled approximately 528 million retail prescriptions or approximately 17 of the us retail pharmacy market 

  

as of december 29 2007 we operated 462 retail healthcare clinics in 25 states under the minuteclinic ® name of which 437 are located within cvs retail drugstores the clinics utilize nationally recognized medical protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions and are staffed by boardcertified nurse practitioners and physician assistants 

our strategy  our goal is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

our products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows 

 

  

 pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented 678 of retail pharmacy revenues in 2007 compared to 684 in 2006 and 686 in 2005 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products a new federally funded prescription drug benefit which was promulgated on january 1 2006 as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” and our on going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology as such our pharmacy service initiative which is designed to resolve potential problems at the point of dropoff that could delay a prescription being filled has enabled us to improve our dispensing process resulting in improved customer service ratings further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our drug utilization review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies our rx connect system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  and our online business cvscom 

front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customer’s needs and preferences for example we were the first retail pharmacy to market with a digital photo solution throughout our chain including being the first to offer printing from digital camera phones the ability to upload digital photos to cvscom and have them available for in store pickup the following day and the first to offer a onetimeuse digital camera a key component of our front store strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base in addition extracare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states extracare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks tm rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 2100 cvs brand and proprietary brand products which accounted for approximately 14 of our front store revenues during 2007 

  

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2007 we opened 139 new stores relocated 136 stores and closed 44 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1300 new and relocated stores and acquired more than 1960 stores approximately two thirds of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2008 we expect to open between 300 and 325 new or relocated stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill tm  which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone in addition we have installed rx connect which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions further we have implemented our assisted inventory management system which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces outofstock positions and lowers our investment in inventory most recently we rolledout visible improvement in profits execution and results a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to all transactions processed through our pointofsale systems in addition we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking 

customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 95 of our 2007 pharmacy revenues since our revenues relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total revenues we also fill prescriptions for many government funded programs including state medicaid plans and medicare part d drug plans 

seasonality  the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 68 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs health clinics and internet pharmacies 

  

pharmacy services segment 

the pharmacy services business provides a full range of prescription benefit management “pbm” services including mail order pharmacy services specialty pharmacy services plan design and administration formulary management and claims processing our customers are primarily employers insurance companies unions government employee groups managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in addition through our silverscript insurance company “silverscript” subsidiary we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government’s medicare part d program our specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies our pharmacy services business operates a national retail pharmacy network with over 60000 participating pharmacies including cvspharmacy stores we also provide health management programs which include integrated disease management for 27 conditions through our accordant ® health management offering the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance the “ncqa” currently the pharmacy services business operates under the caremark pharmacy services ®  pharmacare management services ® and pharmacare pharmacy ® names as of december 29 2007 the pharmacy services segment operated 56 retail specialty pharmacy stores 20 specialty mail order pharmacies and 9 mail service pharmacies located in 26 states and the district of columbia specialty pharmacy stores average 2000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications homeopathic remedies and vitamins 

our strategy  our business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality customer service in order to enhance clinical outcomes for the participants in our customers’ health benefit plans while assisting our customers in better managing their overall healthcare costs we believe that our focus on management of our customers’ overall healthcare costs our mail service specialty pharmaceutical and health management expertise and the breadth and quality of our product and service offerings which are expected to be significantly enhanced as a result of the caremark merger distinguish us from many of our competitors 

our services  the pbm services we provide for our customers involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the cost and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use 

plan design and administration  our customers sponsor pharmacy benefit plans which facilitate the ability of eligible participants in these plans to receive medications prescribed by their physicians we assist our customers in designing pharmacy benefit plans that minimize the costs to the customer while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the customer’s participants we also administer these benefit plans for our customers and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent informal communications as well as through a formal annual customer review 

we make recommendations to our customers encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost most clinically appropriate drug including generics when available we believe that we help our customers control costs by recommending plans that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available our customers also have the option through plan design to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different participant payment levels for different products on our drug lists 

formulary development  we utilize an independent panel of doctors pharmacists and other medical experts referred to as our pharmacy and therapeutics committee to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure participant access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the customer’s pharmacy benefit plan to improve clinical outcomes for participants and customers we conduct ongoing independent reviews of all drugs including but not limited to those appearing on the drug list and generic equivalent products as well as of our clinical programs 

  

discounted drug purchase arrangements  we negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists and the customers that choose to adopt our drug lists receive reduced costs from these negotiated discounts the discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for our receiving discounts from established list prices in one or a combination of the following forms these discounts may take the form of a direct discount at the time of purchase a discount for prompt payment of invoices or when products are indirectly purchased from a manufacturer eg through a wholesaler or retail pharmacychain a retroactive discount or rebate we also receive additional discounts under our wholesale contracts if we exceed contractuallydefined annual purchase volumes we record these discounts regardless of their form as a reduction of our cost of revenues 

prescription management systems  we dispense prescription drugs both directly through our own pharmacies and indirectly through a network of third party retail pharmacies all prescriptions whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network are analyzed processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems these systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating tests for various items including but not limited to plan eligibility early refills duplicate dispensing appropriateness of dosage drug interactions or allergies overutilization and potential fraud 

mail pharmacy program  we currently operate 9 large automated mail service pharmacies in the continental united states our customers or their physicians submit prescriptions primarily for maintenance medications to these pharmacies via mail telephone fax or the internet we also operate a network of 20 smaller mail service specialty pharmacies located throughout the united states and used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders substantially all of the mail service specialty pharmacies have been accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations “jcaho” additionally we operate a united states food and drug administration “fda” regulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription amounts dispensed from our automated mail service pharmacies our staff pharmacists review mail service prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems this review may involve communications with the prescribing physician and with the physician’s approval can result in generic substitution therapeutic interchange or other actions to affect cost or to improve quality of treatment in these cases we inform participants about the changes made to their prescriptions 

carecenter ® pharmacies  we also operate a limited number of carecenter pharmacies located at client sites which provide participants with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions 

retail pharmacy program  our retail pharmacy program typically allows customers to fill prescriptions at more than 60000 pharmacies nationwide including cvspharmacy stores when a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy the network pharmacist sends prescription data electronically to us from the pointofsale this data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems which verify relevant customer data including eligibility and participant information perform drug utilization review to determine clinical appropriateness and safety and confirm that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription 

quality assurance  we have adopted and implemented clinical quality assurance procedures as well as policies and procedures to help ensure regulatory compliance under our quality assurance programs each new mail service prescription undergoes a sequence of safety and accuracy checks and is reviewed and verified by a registered pharmacist before shipment we also analyze drugrelated outcomes to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care 

health management programs  our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer customers convenience in working with healthcare providers and other third parties our accordantcare ® health management programs include integrated disease management which includes over 20 diseases such as asthma coronary artery disease congestive heart failure diabetes hemophilia rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis the majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the ncqa 

  

information systems  we currently operate primary information systems platforms to support our pbm services which are supplemented by additional information systems to support our pharmacy operations these information systems incorporate integrated architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other customer service contracts 

customers  our customers are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans employers unions government employee groups insurance companies and managed care organizations and individuals located throughout the united states we dispense pharmaceuticals to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers and utilize our information systems to perform safety checks drug interaction screening and generic substitution in addition we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government’s medicare part d program we generate substantially all of our net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers during the year ended december 29 2007 we managed over 490 million prescriptions for individuals from over 4000 organizations and our largest customer the federal employees health benefits program accounted for approximately 7 of our pharmacy services segment net revenue 

in 2005 we were approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” to participate in the drug benefit added to the medicare program through part d “medicare drug benefit” of the mma we participate in the administration of the medicare drug benefit through the provision of pbm services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as medicare part d prescription drug plans caremark also participates i by offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits through its subsidiary silverscript which has been approved by cms as a prescription drug plan under medicare part d in all regions of the country and ii by assisting employer union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility andor drug cost data to cms in order for them to obtain the subsidy in addition pharmacare through a joint venture with universal american insurance corp also participates in the offering of medicare part d pharmacy benefits by affiliated entities of universal american that have qualified as medicare part d prescription drug plans in february 2008 the company and universal american agreed to dissolve this joint venture at the end of the 2008 plan year and to divide responsibility for providing medicare part d services to the affected universal american plan members beginning with the 2009 plan year the terms of this agreement are subject to regulatory approval 

competition  we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include i the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers ii the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from and access to retail pharmacy networks iii responsiveness to customers’ needs iv the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies v the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists vi the ability to market pbm products and services vii the commitment to provide flexible clinicallyoriented services to customers and viii the quality scope and costs of products and services offered to customers and their participants the pharmacy services segment competes with a number of large national pbm companies including medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many smaller local or regional pbms we also compete with several large health insurersmanaged care plans eg wellpoint aetna cigna and retail pharmacies which have their own pbm capabilities as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours

among the existing federal and state laws and regulations that affect aspects of our business are the following 

antiremuneration laws  federal law prohibits among other things an entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase lease or order or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under medicare medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs a number of states have similar laws some of which are not limited to services for which governmentfunded payment may be made state laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies sanctions for violating these federal and state antiremuneration laws may include imprisonment criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored healthcare programs the federal antiremuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts the office of inspector general the “oig” within the united states department of health and human services “hhs” and administrative bodies because of the federal statute’s broad scope hhs established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers certain personal services arrangements certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians and certain other 

  

transactions and relationships a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by hhs 

in april 2003 the oig issued a compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the “oig guidance” in the oig guidance the oig identifies potential risk areas for pharmaceutical manufacturers and also discusses a number of traditional relationships between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms such as discount payments service offerings and data sales and recommends that such relationships be structured wherever possible to fit within an applicable safe harbor 

the federal antiremuneration law has been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs additionally certain governmental entities have commenced investigations of companies in the pharmaceutical services industry and have identified issues concerning development of preferred drug lists therapeutic substitution programs pricing of pharmaceutical products and discounts from prescription drug manufacturers 

antitrust  numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states under various state and federal antitrust laws by retail pharmacies against drug manufacturers challenging certain brand drug pricing practices these suits allege in part that the pharmaceutical manufacturers offered and we and certain other pbms knowingly accepted rebates and discounts on purchases of brandname prescription drugs in violation of the federal robinsonpatman act and the federal sherman act the robinsonpatman act generally prohibits discriminatory pricing practices the sherman act generally prohibits contracts and combinations that unreasonably restrain trade or facilitate monopolization of any part of interstate commerce an adverse outcome in any of these lawsuits could require defendant drug manufacturers to provide the same types of discounts on pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and buying groups as are provided to pbms and managed care entities to the extent that their respective abilities to influence market share are comparable this practice if generally followed in the industry could impact the purchase discounts we negotiate for our business 

in addition several lawsuits have been filed against us and some of our pbm competitors by certain retail pharmacies and pharmacysupported interest groups alleging that pbm practices relating to maintaining retail pharmacy networks constitute antitrust violations under the sherman act to the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anticompetitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

comprehensive pbm regulation  legislation seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to customers and plan participants ii require pbms to remit to customers or their plan participants certain rebates discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs iii regulate product substitution and intervention andor iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to customers and their plan participants to the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating pbms that survive legal challenges to their enforceability such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect 

in addition certain quasiregulatory organizations including the national association of boards of pharmacy and the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning pbms andor pbm activities and ncqa the utilization review accreditation commission “urac” or other credentialing organizations may provide voluntary standards regarding pbm activities in 2007 for example urac finalized pbm accreditation standards for pbms serving the commercially insured market and caremark has been accredited as a pbm by urac urac has stated that it also intends to develop standards for the medicare and health plan markets while the actions of these quasiregulatory organizations do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence customer requirements for pbm services moreover any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan customers andor the services we provide to them 

  

in addition to state statutes and regulations we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise potential common law claims could involve for example breach of fiduciary duty constructive fraud fraud or unjust enrichment the application of these common laws to pbms andor pbm activities could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms 

consumer protection laws  the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations lawsuits and multistate settlements relating to among other matters financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic substitution programs see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information concerning a multistate consumer protection settlement affecting caremark 

corporate integrity agreement  in september 2005 caremark’s subsidiary advancepcs now known as caremarkpcs llc entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government relating to certain alleged pbm business practices pursuant to which advancepcs agreed among other things to adhere to certain business practices pursuant to a consent order and to maintain a compliance program in accordance with a corporate integrity agreement for a period of five years our pbm subsidiaries have agreed with limited exceptions to comply with the requirements of the corporate integrity agreement applicable to advancepcs 

the corporate integrity agreement requires that we maintain our current compliance program complete additional training requirements report and return any overpayments received from federal health care programs notify the oig of any new investigations or legal proceedings initiated by a governmental entity involving an allegation of fraud or criminal conduct against us engage an independent review organization to perform limited annual audits and submit regular compliance reports to the oig failure to meet our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could result in stipulated financial penalties in addition failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our pbm business from participation in federal health care programs 

customer audit  we are subject to customer audits of our pbm services pursuant to certain provisions in our customer contracts that grant audit rights these contract provisions are customary in our pbm contracts and the audits are typically conducted by or on behalf of our customers because some of our customer contracts are with state or federal governments audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs maintained by our customers including those which operate prescription drug plans or medicare advantage organizations under the mma the audits generally focus on among other things compliance with the applicable terms of our customer contract and applicable legal requirements 

erisa regulation  the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and health benefit plans including selffunded corporate health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide pbm services in general we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors we do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of erisa except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims andor the appeals of denied claims under a plan we and other pbms have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary as such term is defined by erisa with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under erisa see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

in addition to its fiduciary provisions erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to covered health plans and certain other persons if certain forms or excessive amounts of remuneration are paid or received these provisions of erisa are similar but not identical to the healthcare antiremuneration statutes discussed elsewhere in this government regulation section and they do not contain the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions included in other healthcare statutes these provisions of erisa are broadly written and we cannot be certain of the extent to which they could be deemed applicable to the conduct of our business 

  

the department of labor has recently published proposed regulations that could potentially create disclosure requirements for service providers to erisa plans regarding direct and indirect compensation and potential conflicts of interest the proposed regulations are broadly written and are subject to public comment we cannot be certain of the content of these regulations if and when they are finalized or the extent to which they could be deemed applicable to our business 

state laws discussed in this government regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by erisa however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 

false claims and fraudulent billing statutes  a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from a governmentsponsored program some states have passed substantially similar acts in recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” for example requires certain entities that receive or make annual medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts whistleblower protections and the entity’s processes for detecting and preventing fraud waste and abuse claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” action as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this government regulation section 

in addition federal and state governments have commenced numerous investigations of various pharmaceutical manufacturers pbms pharmacies and healthcare providers in recent years with respect to false claims fraudulent billing and related matters the federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the federal false claims act by i improperly marketing and pricing drugs ii overstating the average wholesale prices of products iii paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs andor iv failing to accurately report “best price” under the medicaid program 

fda regulation  the fda generally has authority to regulate drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer we operate a fdaregulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies the fda also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs 

formulary regulation  a number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits for example some states have passed laws mandating coverage for offlabel uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peerreviewed medical journals or reference compendia other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers mcos and other third party payors these laws have included requirements on the development review and update of formularies the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members and a process for allowing members to obtain nonpreferred drugs without additional costsharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate additionally the naic has developed a model law the “health carriers prescription drug benefit management model act” that addresses formulary regulation issues for riskbearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners the mma also regulates how formularies are developed for and administered to beneficiaries of the medicare drug benefit to the extent that such legislation would be applicable to our business increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer mco and other customers 

health management services regulation  we provide customers with clinical services in the form of health management programs and we employ nurses and other clinicians where needed to develop and implement our health management programs all states regulate the practice of medicine and the practice of nursing and employees engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

  

managed care reform  proposed legislation has been considered on both the federal and state level and legislation has been enacted in several states aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans this legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our pbm health plan customers andor the services we provide to them some of these initiatives would among other things i require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan’s formulary ii give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care andor iii mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by congress and state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain 

medicare prescription drug benefit  the mma created the medicare drug benefit starting in january 2006 medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b are eligible for the medicare drug benefit under medicare part d the mma also created a subsidy available to certain employer union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to part d eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to part d coverage the “retiree drug subsidy” regulations implementing the medicare drug benefit were published beginning in january 2005 and include without limitation requirements relating to developing and administering formularies establishing pharmacy networks processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards government rules and regulations which continue to evolve impact the funding available for medicare programs pbm contracting arrangements with retail pharmacies pharmaceutical manufacturers or other parties related to the medicare drug benefit and other terms and conditions affecting the medicare part d services we provide for instance the mmamandated risk corridor thresholds and the level of risksharing by the federal government will change in 2008 resulting in part d sponsors including silverscript assuming an increased level of drug cost risk therefore to the extent that silverscript’s actual drug costs are higher or lower than estimated in its bids for 2008 and subsequent years the federal government will share a smaller portion of the losses or gains respectively during 2007 cms promulgated rules and regulations impacting calculation of the retiree drug subsidy of part d sponsors in addition regulations have been issued or proposed that would impact beginning in 2009 whether the differential between the drug price charged to part d sponsors by a pbm and the drug price paid by the pbm to the dispensing pharmacy would constitute an administrative cost rather than a drug cost to the part d sponsor for purposes of calculating reinsurance and risk corridor subsidy payments by the government 

network access legislation  a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers certain “any willing provider” legislation may require us or our customers to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation these laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application erisa plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of erisa preemption however the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings in addition the mma contains an “any willing provider” requirement for pharmacy participation in the medicare drug benefit and cms has interpreted this as requiring that a medicare part d prescription drug plan must for each type of pharmacy in its part d network allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation by that type of pharmacy that the plan has established to the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our customers or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our pbm customers such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network 

some states also have enacted “due process” legislation that may prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network except in compliance with certain procedures other state legislation prohibits days’ supply limitations or copayment differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers in addition under medicare part d cms requires that if a part d sponsor offers a 90day supply at mail it must allow retail pharmacies to also offer a 90day supply on the same terms 

pharmacy licensure and regulation  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies repackaging of drug products wholesale distribution dispensing of controlled substances and medical waste disposal federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and our repackaging facility with the united states drug enforcement administration and to comply with security recordkeeping inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances 

  

we also are subject to certain federal and state laws affecting online pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our internet websites among other methods several states have proposed new laws to regulate online pharmacies and federal regulation of online pharmacies by the fda or another federal agency has also been proposed 

other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations for example the federal trade commission “ftc” requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate in addition the united states postal service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail 

our pharmacists are subject to state regulation of the profession of pharmacy and employees engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

plan design legislation  some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits for example some states have adopted “freedom of choice” legislation which provides that i members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers or ii a plan participant may sue his or her health plan if care is denied various states have enacted or have considered enacting legislation regarding plan design mandates including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic substitution requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for nonfda approved uses some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions such legislation does not generally apply to us but it may apply to certain of our customers generally mcos and health insurers other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by erisa from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our customers and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbm services we provide 

privacy and confidentiality legislation  many of our activities involve the receipt use and disclosure by us of confidential health information including disclosure of the confidential information to a participant’s health benefit plan as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws in addition we use and disclose deidentified data for analytical and other purposes the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively “hipaa” impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans healthcare providers healthcare clearinghouses known as “covered entities” and their business associates use disclose and safeguard protected health information “phi” including requirements to protect the integrity availability and confidentiality of electronic phi hipaa gives individuals the right to know how their phi is used and disclosed the right to access amend and obtain information concerning certain disclosures of phi covered entities such as pharmacies and health plans are required to provide a written notice of privacy practices to individuals that describes how the entity uses and discloses phi and how individuals may exercise their rights with respect to their phi for most uses and disclosures of phi other than for treatment payment healthcare operations or certain public policy purposes hipaa generally requires that covered entities obtain a valid written individual authorization in most cases use or disclosure of phi must be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with hipaa standards 

in addition to hipaa most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information these state laws supersede hipaa to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is hipaa 

in addition to establishing privacy and security standards for phi hipaa established national standards for conducting certain healthcare transactions electronically known as “standard transactions” as well as national identifiers for employers and health care providers the national provider identifier “npi” rule requires that all health care providers that conduct standard transactions apply for and obtain an npi and that all covered entities use this npi in any standard transaction where that health care provider’s identifier is required this rule will have a significant operational 

  

impact on our business in that all electronic pharmacy claims will have to reflect the pharmacy’s npi and to the extent the prescriber is a covered entity the prescriber’s npi instead of current identifiers such as the national council for prescription drug program numbers cms has stated that it will not impose penalties on covered entities through may 2008 if they deploy contingency plans and have made reasonable and diligent efforts to become compliant with the rule 

in response to concerns about identity theft many states have passed security breach notification laws including laws requiring notification to consumers of security breaches involving personal information these laws generally require an entity conducting business in the state to notify consumers when their personal information has been or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person in some cases the law applies only to unencrypted computerized information but in others it applies to personal information in any form in addition to requiring notification to the affected individuals without unreasonable delay many state laws also require notification to government agencies such as the state attorney general or consumer protection agencies 

reimbursement  a portion of our net revenue is derived directly from medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and we are therefore subject to among other laws and regulations federal and state antiremuneration laws the stark law andor federal and state false claims laws discussed elsewhere in this section sanctions for violating these federal andor state laws may include without limitation criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs also we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of medicare medicaid and other governmentsponsored healthcare programs as well as employers that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy 

the federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs one element common to most payment formulas average wholesale price “awp” has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level the calculation and reporting of awp have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report awp we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of awp however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our customer contracts pharmaceutical purchase agreements retail network contracts and other agreements use awp as a pricing benchmark in october 2006 first databank “fdb” one of two primary sources of awp price reporting announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement relating to its awp reporting subject to final court approval under the terms of the proposed settlement agreement fdb agreed to reduce the reported awp of certain drugs by four percent and to discontinue the publishing of awp at a future time in may 2007 medispan the other primary source of awp price reporting entered into a similar settlement agreement also subject to final court approval in january 2008 the court denied approval of the fdb and medispan settlements as proposed and the outcome of the pending litigation remains uncertain 

under the mma the average sales price “asp” has replaced awp as the basis for reimbursing physicians and sometimes pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs under medicare part b for single source drugs the payment will equal 106 percent of the lesser of i the wholesale acquisition cost “wac” of the product or ii the asp of the product asp is the weighted average of a manufacturer’s sales to all purchasers in a given quarter after certain pricing adjustments such as discounts or rebates and excluding sales to certain government and other purchasers 

further the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 151 of the average manufacturer price “amp” paid by wholesalers for products distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade or b the difference between amp and the “best price” available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program with certain exceptions investigations have been commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether “best price” was properly calculated reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for calculations reports or payments of “best price” however these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers 

during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing provisions under the dra regarding prescription drugs under the medicaid program among other things the rule defines amp and “best price” and specifies the items that must be included and excluded in the calculation of each “amp rule” under the amp rule which became effective october 1 2007 sales to mail pharmacies would be included in the calculation of amp but rebates and other discounts 

  

negotiated by pbms in their capacity as pbms would be excluded the rule also implements the dra provision establishing a new reimbursement formula for generic drugs under medicaid and establishes federal upper limits “fuls” for generics based on 250 percent of the lowest amp in a given drug class although the amp rule is final cms has asked for public comments on the amp and ful outlier provisions to assist it in fully considering the issues and developing policies so changes to the amp rule or its interpretation could occur in december 2007 the us district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing the amp rule to the extent such action affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies and from posting online or disclosing any amp data 

certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact instate dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program give the state the “best price” that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor these requirements are sometimes referred to as “most favored nation pricing” payment systems other states have enacted “unitary pricing” legislation which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state’s population 

changes in reporting of awp or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 

reimportation  the mma amended the food drug and cosmetic act by providing that the fda should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states under certain circumstances however the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the fda certify to congress that such reimportation would not pose any additional risk to the public’s health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction to date the fda has not provided such a certification in the past under certain defined circumstances the fda has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the us small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patient’s serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the us in september 2006 congress expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from canada for their personal use a 90day supply of any prescription drug regardless of availability in the us the language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the internet and excludes biologics and controlled substances the fda continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from canada and elsewhere citing concerns that such activities undermine the fda’s ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nation’s drug supply if the fda changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from canada in the future or if new legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future our pharmacy services could be impacted 

selfreferral laws  the federal law commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for “designated health services” which include among other things outpatient prescription drugs home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a “financial relationship” and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute civil monetary penalties and medicare and medicaid program exclusion the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships including certain physician consulting arrangements fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians 

state statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered loss of pharmacy or healthcare provider licenses fines and criminal penalties the laws 

  

and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state the laws are often vague and in many cases have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 

state insurance laws  feeforservice prescription drug plans and our pbm service contracts including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guaranties or similar arrangements are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states however if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits laws and regulations in various states may be applicable such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing mcos and limited prepaid health service plans 

pursuant to the mma silverscript must be licensed as a riskbearing entity under state laws or have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms silverscript received a license in 2006 from the tennessee department of commerce and insurance to operate as a health insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations of the state of tennessee silverscript also has filed expansion applications for licensure as an insurance company in other jurisdictions where it may seek to do business and to date silverscript has received licenses to operate as an insurance company in 41 other states and the district of columbia and has maintained waivers of such licensing requirements in all remaining states in accordance with cms requirements as a licensed insurance company silverscript is subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require among other things maintenance of capital and surplus requirements review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial and operational reports if silverscript is unable either to acquire all necessary insurance licenses or to maintain waivers of such licensing requirements there may be a materially adverse impact on silverscript’s ability to participate in the medicare drug benefit as a prescription drug plan pursuant to the mma state insurance licensing insurance agentbroker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to prescription drug plans but the application of other state laws to the medicare drug benefit are generally preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 

some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company these state laws vary and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties additionally several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires among other things that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties these laws vary from state to state in regard to scope requirements and application and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our customers or to us certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of erisa preemption but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

state prescription drug assistance programs  many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs “spaps” that supplement the medicare drug benefit payments by qualified spaps on behalf of a medicare part d enrollee are treated under medicare part d as if they were made by the enrollees themselves thereby counting towards the enrollees’ true outofpocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner prescription drug plans under medicare part d are required to coordinate benefits with spaps including allowing spaps to subsidize the medicare part d premiums of their members andor their medicare part d cost sharing some qualified spaps have also received permission from cms to autoassign their enrollees that do not choose their own medicare part d plans into medicare part d plans we have been and continue to be in active discussions with spaps to coordinate benefits with our medicare drug benefit offerings and where applicable enrollment by spap members into our prescription drug plan under medicare part d 

telemarketing  certain federal and state laws give the ftc and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices these laws may require disclosures of specific information prohibit misrepresentations limit when consumers may be called require transmission of caller id information prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls prohibit unauthorized billing set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services and require the retention of specific business records 

third party administration and other state licensure laws  many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations such as preferred provider organizations third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs also known as cash card or discount card programs the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear 

  

whistleblower statutes  certain federal and state laws including the federal false claims act contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits alleging violations of such laws whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit these lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation if the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment if the government does not intervene in the lawsuit the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed a process which may take years see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

we believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and pbm businesses we have implemented standard operating procedures internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

inability to realize the cost savings and other benefits of the caremark merger 

we may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated operating and cost synergies or longterm strategic benefits of the caremark merger an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the merger could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter healthcare financing practices could adversely affect our businesses 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations other pbm companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate in addition during the past several years the us healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may affect healthcare financing and reimbursement practices if the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system changes significantly the combined company’s business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

on february 8 2006 the president signed into law the dra the dra seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs according to the congressional budget office retail pharmacies are expected to negotiate with individual states for higher dispensing fees to mitigate the adverse effect of these changes these changes were expected to begin to take effect in 2007 and to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies during 2007 cms issued a final rule implementing the new reimbursement formula subsequent to issuance of this rule a group of retail pharmacy industry trade groups filed suit in federal district court seeking to enjoin cms from implementing the rule on december 14 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia preliminarily enjoined cms from implementing the final rule to the extent such action affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies as a result implementation has been delayed indefinitely accordingly the extent of any reductions and the impact on the company cannot be determined at this time 

the possibility of customer loss andor the failure to win new business may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our pbm business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related healthcare services to plan participants pbm client contracts generally have terms approximating 3 years in duration 

  

accordingly approximately one third of a pbm’s customer base typically is subject to renewal each year and therefore we face challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business although none of our pbm clients are expected to represent more than 10 of our company’s consolidated revenues in 2008 our top 10 clients are expected to represent approximately 332 of such revenues in 2008 there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the company as the present terms accordingly our failure to renew or win pbm business could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of new prescription drugs as well as generic alternatives to brand name prescription products 

the profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products utilization trends are affected by the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products accordingly a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals andor generic alternatives the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks of declining gross margins in the pbm industry 

the pbm industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices enhanced service offerings andor higher service levels in that regard our company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts andor rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our national retail network including cvspharmacy stores and by our mail order pharmacies all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients manufacturer rebates often depend on a pbm’s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the pbm’s formularies competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused caremark and other pbms to share with clients a larger portion of rebates andor discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers or to formulary management or other pbm services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive accordingly margin pressure in the pbm industry resulting form these trends could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

uncertainty regarding the impact of medicare part d may adversely affect our business financial position and our results of operations 

since its inception in 2006 the medicare drug benefit has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to medicare part d coverage further as a result of the medicare drug benefit our pbm clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members if this occurs the adverse effects of the medicare drug benefit may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit since the program continues to evolve we are not yet able to assess the full impact that medicare part d will have on clients’ decisions to continue to offer a prescription drug benefit to their medicareeligible members in addition if the cost and complexity of the medicare drug benefit exceed management’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if the government alters medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma’s competitive bidding process our medicare part d services and the ability to expand our medicare part d services could be materially and adversely affected and our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including caremark’s network contracts and its pbm and specialty client contracts generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include awp asp and wac most of our pbm client contracts utilize the awp standard further most of the contracts governing the participation of cvs stores in retail pharmacy networks also utilize the awp standard 

  

recent events including the fdb and medispan litigation described in the government regulation of healthcare matters section have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry 

changes in reporting of awp or in the basis for calculating reimbursement proposed by the federal government and certain states and other legislative or regulatory adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of payments for drugs by medicaid and medicare could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts with manufacturers wholesalers pbms or retail pharmacies in some circumstances such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from medicare or medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from mcos that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits in addition it is possible that payors pharmacy providers and pbms will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and pbm services in the future and the effect of this development on the business of the company cannot be predicted at this time 

the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

each of the retail pharmacy business and the pbm business currently operates in a highly competitive environment as a pharmacy retailer we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and retail health clinics as well as other mail order pharmacies and pbms in regard many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies to the extent this trend continues our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business in addition some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

competitors in the pbm industry include large national pbm companies such as medco health solutions inc and express scripts inc as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg wellpoint aetna cigna unitedhealthcare and retail pharmacies eg walgreens longs and rite aid which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we even if the anticipated benefits of our merger are realized in full may not be able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

existing and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

the pbm business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations see “business – government regulation of healthcare matters” changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalties suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications or approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs or loss of licensure the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to the laws and regulations described in the government regulation of healthcare matters section accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and regulations of the fda the us federal trade commission the drug enforcement administration and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell in that regard our business financial position and results of operations could be affected by one or more of the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

pharmacy services and retail pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries our company is currently subject to various litigation matters and legal proceedings resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as such we refer you to item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

efforts to reform the us healthcare system may adversely affect our financial performance 

congress periodically considers proposals to reform the us healthcare system these proposals may increase government involvement in healthcare and regulation of pbm or pharmacy services or otherwise change the way the combined company or its clients do business health plan sponsors may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the combined company would provide the company cannot predict what effect if any these proposals may have on its retail and pharmacy services businesses other legislative or marketdriven changes in the healthcare system that the company cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect the combined company’s consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position andor consolidated cash flow from operations 

the health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and our financial results 

our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power preferences andor spending patterns our ability to attract hire and retain suitable pharmacists management nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants as well as establishing effective advertising marketing and promotional programs is directly impacted by the economic environment further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms andor our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms

proposed caremark merger 

on november 1 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with caremark rx inc “caremark” the agreement is structured as a merger of equals under which caremark shareholders will receive 1670 shares of common stock par value 001 per share of cvs for each share of common stock of caremark par value 0001 per share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger the closing of the transaction which is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2007 is subject to approval by the shareholders of both cvs and caremark as well as customary regulatory approvals including review under the hartscottrodino act accordingly there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated see “risk factorsrisks related to the proposed merger” 

caremark is a leading pharmacy benefits manager in the united states caremark’s operations involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use caremark’s customers are primarily employers insurance companies unions government employee groups managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in addition caremark through its silverscript insurance subsidiary is a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government’s medicare part d program 

caremark operates a national retail pharmacy network with over 60000 participating pharmacies including cvs’ pharmacy stores 7 mail service pharmacies 21 specialty mail service pharmacies and the industry’s only repackaging plant regulated by the food and drug administration through its accordant® disease management offering caremark also provides disease management programs for 27 conditions twentyone of these programs are accredited by the national committee for quality assurance 

on december 18 2006 caremark received an unsolicited offer from a competing pharmacy benefits manager express scripts inc “express scripts” pursuant to which express scripts offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of caremark for 2925 in cash and 0426 shares of express scripts common stock for each share of caremark common stock 

on december 20 2006 the initial waiting period under the hartscottrodino act for the cvscaremark merger expired without a request for additional information from the us federal trade commission 

on january 7 2007 caremark issued a press release announcing that it board of directors after thorough consideration and consultation with its legal and financial advisers had determined that the express scripts proposal did not constitute and was not reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal under the terms of the merger agreement with cvs caremark further announced that its board of directors had unanimously concluded that pursuing discussions with express scripts was not in the best financial or strategic interests of caremark and its shareholders 

on january 16 2007 cvs and caremark announced that caremark shareholders would receive a special onetime cash dividend of 2 per share upon or promptly after closing of the transaction in addition cvs and caremark agreed that as promptly as practicable after the closing of the merger an accelerated share repurchase transaction will be executed whereby 150 million of the outstanding shares of the combined company will be retired on january 19 2007 the registration statement on form s4 relating to the proposed merger was declared effective by the u s securities and exchange commission the “sec” in addition a special meeting of caremark shareholders to approve the merger was scheduled for february 20 2007 and a special meeting of cvs shareholders to be held for the same purpose was scheduled for february 23 2007 

on february 13 2007 cvs and caremark announced that the special onetime cash dividend payable to caremark shareholders upon or promptly after the closing of the transaction would be increased to 6 per share caremark also announced that on february 12 2007 its board of directors had declared the 6 special cash dividend payable upon or promptly after closing of the merger to caremark shareholders of record on the date immediately preceding the closing date of the merger in connection with its declaration of such dividend the caremark board also unanimously reaffirmed its recommendation that caremark shareholders vote “for” the merger with cvs at the caremark special meeting of shareholders 

on february 13 2007 the court of chancery of the state of delaware determined that to permit additional time for dissemination to caremark shareholders of certain recently filed information the caremark special meeting of shareholders to approve the merger must be postponed to a date not earlier than march 9 2007 

on february 23 2007 the court of chancery of the state of delaware further delayed the caremark shareholder vote until twenty days after caremark makes supplemental disclosures regarding caremark shareholders’ right to seek appraisal and the structure of fees to be paid by caremark to its financial advisors the supplemental disclosures were mailed to caremark shareholders on february 24 2007 see “risk factorsrisks related to cvs caremark and the combined company” and “legal proceedings” for a fuller discussion of these matters also on february 24 2007 caremark announced that its special meeting of shareholders to approve the merger had been adjourned to march 16 2007 on february 23 2007 cvs announced that its special meeting of shareholders to be held for the same purpose would be adjourned until march 9 2007 in light of the delaware court’s ruling cvs intends to once again adjourn the meeting to a later date in march and will inform shareholders of the new meeting date as promptly as possible 

retail pharmacy business 

our strategy  our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction

our products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows

   

1 percentages are estimates based on store pointofsale data 

pharmacy  pharmacy revenues represented 696 of total revenues in 2006 compared to 702 in 2005 and 700 in 2004 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products and a new federally funded prescription drug benefit which was promulgated on january 1 2006 as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology as such our pharmacy service initiative “psi” which is designed to resolve potential problems at the point of dropoff that could delay a prescription being filled has enabled us to give customers what they want further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our excellence in pharmacy innovation and care “epic” system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm and our online business cvscom

front store  front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customer’s needs and preferences for example we were the first retail pharmacy to market with a digital photo solution throughout our chain including being the first to offer printing from digital camera phones the ability to upload digital photos to cvscom and have them available for in store pickup the following day and the first to offer a onetimeuse digital camera a key component of our strategy is our extracare® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer

base in addition extracare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states extracare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks tm rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 2000 cvs brand products in addition cvs offers a unique front store focus on cosmetics health and beauty by being a us distributor of several european cosmetics and skin care lines including lumene® avene® and vichy® in 2005 we launched our new skin effects® skin care line by dr jeffrey dover and in 2006 we launched a new skin effects® sun care line and introduced a cvs exclusive line of diapers wipes and other baby care products under the playskool® brand cvs brand and exclusive products accounted for approximately 14 of our front store revenues during 2006

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2006 we opened 147 new stores acquired 701 stores relocated 118 stores and closed 117 stores including 73 stores of the standalone drug business during the last five years we opened more than 1300 new and relocated stores and acquired more than 1960 stores approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2007 we expect to open approximately 275 new or relocated stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry

information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill tm  which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone in addition we have installed epic which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions further we have implemented our assisted inventory management “aim” system which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces outofstock positions and lowers our investment in inventory most recently we rolledout viper a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to all transactions processed through our pos systems in addition during 2006 we opened our second distribution center with fully integrated technology solutions for storage product retrieval and order picking

customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 95 of our 2006 pharmacy revenues since our revenues relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total revenues

we also fill prescriptions for many state medicaid plans total revenues from all such plans were approximately 7 of total pharmacy revenues during 2006 under the medicare modernization act medicare eligible patients that were previously receiving medicaid prescription coverage were automatically transitioned to medicare coverage effective january 1 2006 as a result we saw a decline as dual eligible participants transitioned from the higher margin medicaid plans to lower margin medicare part d plans however we do not expect a further decrease of any significance in 2007 

seasonality  the majority of our revenues particularly pharmacy revenues are generally not seasonal in nature however front store revenues tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 50 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006

working capital practices  we fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations saleleaseback transactions commercial paper and longterm borrowings for additional information on our working capital practices we refer you to the caption “liquidity  capital resources” on page 22 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 which is incorporated by reference herein due to the nature of the retail drugstore business the majority of our nonpharmacy revenues are in cash while managed care and

other third party insurance programs which typically settle in less than 30 days represented 95 of our pharmacy revenues in 2006 our customer returns are not significant 

associate development  as of december 30 2006 we employed approximately 176000 associates of which approximately 20000 were pharmacists and about 80000 were parttime employees who work less than 30 hours per week to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and partners we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards we emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization

intellectual property and licenses  we have registered or applied to register for a variety of trade names service marks trademarks and business licenses for use in our business we regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in our marketing efforts we are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property our pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of pharmacy our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the federal drug enforcement administration because of these licensing and registration requirements we must comply with various statutes rules and regulations a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of these licenses or registrations

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs and internet pharmacies




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

risks related to the proposed merger 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and our future business and financial results 

if the merger is not completed our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks including the following 

·   having to pay certain costs relating to the merger

·   the attention of our management will have been diverted to the merger instead of on our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us

·   customer perception may be negatively impacted which could affect pharmacare’s ability to compete for or to win new and renewal business in the marketplace and

·   being required under certain circumstances under the merger agreement to pay a termination fee of 675 million to caremark

even if the merger is completed the pendency of the merger could impact or cause disruptions in cvs’ and the combined company’s businesses which could have an adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 

specifically 

·   current and prospective clients of pharmacare and caremark may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to current or future business relationships with pharmacare caremark or the combined company and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than pharmacare caremark or the combined company either before or after completion of the merger

·   caremark and cvs employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company which might adversely affect cvs’ and the combined company’s ability to retain and hire key managers and other employees

·   the attention of management of each of caremark and cvs may be directed toward the completion of the merger and transactionrelated considerations and may be diverted from the daytoday business operations of their respective companies and

·   pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies pharmacy benefit management companies or other vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with cvs caremark or the combined company

approximately one third of a pbm’s customer base typically is subject to renewal each year and therefore caremark and cvs may face additional challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business caremark’s largest client the federal employees health benefits plan is currently subject to renewal for services beginning january 1 2008 there can be no assurance that caremark will be able to secure renewal of this business however such renewal is not a condition to the completion of the merger these disruptions and business challenges could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement and could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of cvs if the merger is not completed or of the combined company if the merger is completed 

we may be unable to successfully integrate caremark’s operations or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger as a result the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 

we entered into a merger agreement because we believe that the merger will be beneficial to us and our stockholders currently caremark operates as an independent public company achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether we can integrate caremark’s business in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration we and caremark operate numerous systems including those involving management information purchasing accounting and finance sales billing employee benefits payroll and regulatory compliance the integration of certain operations following the merger will require the dedication of significant management resources which may temporarily distract management’s attention from our daytoday business employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business any inability of management to integrate successfully the operations of caremark could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or longterm strategic benefits of the merger an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the merger as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of the merger 

our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees competition for qualified personnel can be very intense in addition key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees 

certain legal restrictions have limited our ability to complete and finalize an integration plan relating to the merger of the two companies the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized 

following the merger our common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of our common stock historically 

as our business and the business of caremark are different our results of operations as well as the price of our common stock following the merger may be affected by factors different than those factors affecting us and caremark as independent standalone entities following the merger we will face additional risks and uncertainties not otherwise facing each independent company prior to the merger for a discussion of certain factors to consider in connection with the combined company see the below section titled “—risks related to cvs caremark and the combined company” 

the merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may harm the market price of our common stock 

we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to earnings per share during the first full calendar year after the merger however due to legal restrictions we have been limited in our ability to complete and finalize an integration plan relating to the merger of the two companies accordingly this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change after the completion of the merger we could also encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock 

charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the merger 

in accordance with us gaap we will be considered the acquiror for accounting purposes we will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the completion of the merger under the purchase method of accounting we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from caremark based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the merger and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill for certain tangible and intangible assets reevaluating their fair values as of the completion date of the merger will result in our incurring additional depreciation andor amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by cvs and caremark prior to the merger this increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets in addition to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the merger 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses resulting from the merger will be comprised of transaction costs related to the merger facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment–related costs we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses due to legal restrictions we have been unable to finalize an integration plan which includes plans related to delivery of anticipated synergies relating to the merger of the two companies although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

risks related to cvs caremark and the combined company 

the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business and results of operations following the merger 

we and caremark currently operate in a highly competitive environment we compete and after the completion of the merger we will continue to compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies following the merger we will continue to face competition from other mail order pharmacies and pbms 

the pharmacy benefits management industry in which caremark and to a lesser extent we through pharmacare operate is extremely competitive competitors in the pharmacy benefits management industry include large national pharmacy benefit management companies such as medco health solutions inc and express scripts as well as many local or regional pbms in addition there are several large health insurers and managed care plans eg wellpoint aetna cigna unitedhealthcare and retail pharmacies eg walgreens longs and rite aid which have their own pbm capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that following the merger we even if the anticipated benefits of the merger are realized in full may not be able to offer in addition competition may also come from other sources in the future as a result competition could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations following the merger 

efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter healthcare financing practices could adversely affect cvs’ and the combined company’s businesses 

the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations other pharmacy benefit management companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact the profitability of cvs and the combined company in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to pharmacies for generic drugs causing a reduction in the generic profit rate in addition during the past several years the us healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are underway at the federal and state government levels changing political economic and regulatory influences may affect healthcare financing and reimbursement practices if the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system changes significantly the combined company’s business could be materially adversely affected 

on february 8 2006 the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of 2005 the “dra” the dra seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs according to the congressional budget office retail pharmacies are expected to negotiate with individual states for higher dispensing fees to mitigate the adverse effect of these changes these changes are expected to begin to take effect in late spring 2007 and to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies the extent of these reductions and the impact on the combined company cannot be determined at this time 

in addition congress periodically considers proposals to reform the us healthcare system these proposals may increase government involvement in healthcare and regulation of pbm or pharmacy services or otherwise change the way the combined company or its clients do business health plan sponsors may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the combined company would provide cvs and caremark cannot predict what effect if any these proposals may have on the combined company’s business other legislative or marketdriven changes in the healthcare system that cvs and caremark cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect the combined company’s consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position andor consolidated cash flow from operations 

changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect the financial performance of cvs and the combined company 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including caremark’s and pharmacare’s contracts with retail pharmacy networks as well as their contracts with clients for pbm and specialty services generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price “awp” average selling price “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost “wac” most of caremark’s and pharmacare’s pbm client contracts utilize the awp standard further most of the contracts governing the participation of cvs stores in retail pharmacy networks also utilize the awp standard 

recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry 

specifically in the proposed settlement in the case of new england carpenters health benefits fund et al v first databank et al  a civil class action case brought against first databank “fdb” one of several companies that report data on prescription drug prices and mckesson corporation fdb has agreed to reduce the reported awp of certain drugs by four percent at a future time as contemplated by the settlement at this time the proposed settlement has not received final court approval the court could approve the proposed settlement in part in its entirety or not at all we cannot predict the outcome of this case or if the settlement is approved the precise timing of any of the proposed awp changes or the effect of such changes if any on our financial performance 

over 90 of caremark’s client relationships and most of its relationships with other affected parties contain terms that following the merger we believe will enable us to mitigate any adverse effect of this proposed reduction in fdb’s reported awp two other publicly traded large national pbms have also stated that their contractual relationships contain similar terms however because in some cases payors may seek to negotiate with pbms in an effort to reduce prescription drug costs as a result of a reduction in fdb’s reported awp the ultimate effect of this development on the business of the combined company cannot be precisely predicted 

whatever the outcome of the fdb case it is possible that payors pharmacy providers and pbms will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and pharmacy benefit management services in the future 

uncertainty regarding the impact of medicare part d may adversely impact the business and financial results of cvs and the combined company 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or the mma created a new voluntary prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b the medicare drug benefit became effective on january 1 2006 since its inception the program has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrated to the new medicare part d coverage the full impact on cvs’ or the combined company’s sales and gross margin rates cannot yet be determined and could have different effects on different segments of business 

caremark and pharmacare participate in the administration of the medicare drug benefit through the provision of pbm services to their health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as a medicare part d prescription drug plan caremark also participates 1 through the offering of medicare part d pharmacy benefits by its subsidiary silverscript insurance company which has been approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms as a prescription drug plan sponsor under medicare part d in all regions of the country and 2 by assisting employer union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility andor drug cost data to cms for them in order to obtain the subsidy in addition pharmacare through a joint venture with universal american insurance corp also participates in the offering of medicare part d pharmacy benefits by affiliated entities of universal american clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their medicareeligible members if this occurs the adverse effects of the medicare drug benefit may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit we are not yet able to assess the impact that medicare part d will have on clients’ decisions to continue to offer a prescription drug benefit to their medicareeligible members in addition if the cost and complexity of the medicare drug benefit exceed management’s 

expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higherthananticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma’s competitive bidding process our medicare business and the ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected finally the mma mandated risk corridors in which the federal government shares in the drug cost risk borne by part d plans are scheduled to change in 2008 both the risk corridor thresholds and the level of risksharing will change with the result that medicare drug benefit sponsors will assume an increased level of drug cost risk starting in 2008 therefore to the extent that silverscript insurance company’s actual drug costs are higher or lower than those estimated by it in its bid in 2008 onwards the federal government will share a smaller portion of the losses or gains respectively than it otherwise would have prior to 2008 

existing and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect the business and financial results of cvs and the combined company 

we are subject to changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements and interpretations as a participant in the healthcare and pbm industries our operations are subject to complex and evolving federal and state laws and regulations and enforcement by federal and state governmental agencies 

the pharmacy benefit services business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certification approvals loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs loss of licensure or significant fines or monetary penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies pharmacy benefit managers and healthcare insurance companies applicable medicare and medicaid regulations accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations of the us food and drug administration the us federal trade commission the drug enforcement administration and the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the sale advertisement and promotion of products that we sell antikickback laws false claims laws and federal and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy in that regard the business and results of operations of cvs and the combined company could be affected by one or more of the following

retail pharmacy business 

our strategy  our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe that ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers’ needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction 

our products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise front store categories include overthecounter drugs beauty products and cosmetics film and photo finishing services seasonal merchandise greeting cards and convenience foods we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows 

 

  

 pharmacy  pharmacy sales have been growing and we believe will continue to grow at a faster pace than front store sales pharmacy sales represented 702 of total sales in 2005 compared to 700 in 2004 and 688 in 2003 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends eg an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products and a new federally funded prescription drug benefit effective january 1 2006 promulgated as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” which should increase utilization and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology during 2003 we introduced our pharmacy service initiative “psi” this initiative is designed to resolve potential problems at the point of dropoff that could delay a prescription being filled further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology such as our excellence in pharmacy innovation and care “epic” system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm and our online business cvscom 

front store  front store sales benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customer’s needs and preferences for example we were the first retail pharmacy to market with a digital photo solution throughout our chain including being the first to offer printing from digital camera phones the ability to upload digital photos to cvscom and have them available for in store pickup the following day and the first to offer a onetimeuse digital camera a key component of our strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base in addition extracare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states extracare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks tm rewards and other benefits another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality cvs brand products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 1900 cvs brand products in addition cvs offers a unique front store focus on cosmetics health and beauty by being a us distributor of several european cosmetics and skin care lines 

  

including lumene ®  avene ® and vichy ®  in 2004 we added the exclusive christophe ® hair care line and in 2005 we launched our new skin effects ® line by dr jeffery dover cvs brand and exclusive products accounted for approximately 13 of our front store sales during 2005 

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2005 we opened 166 new stores relocated 131 stores and closed 70 stores during the last five years we opened more than 1300 new and relocated stores and acquired 1268 stores approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2006 we expect to open approximately 250275 new or relocated stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

information systems  we have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill tm  which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone in addition we have installed epic which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions further we have implemented our assisted inventory management “aim” system which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces outofstock positions and lowers our investment in inventory most recently we rolledout viper a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to all transactions processed through our pos systems 

customers  managed care and other third party plans accounted for 94 of our 2005 pharmacy sales since our sales relate to numerous payors including employers and managed care organizations the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total sales 

we also fill prescriptions for many state medicaid plans total sales from all such plans were approximately 13 of total pharmacy sales during 2005 under the medicare modernization act medicare eligible patients currently receiving medicaid prescription coverage will be automatically transitioned to medicare coverage effective january 1 2006 accordingly we estimate that total sales for state medicaid plans will decline to approximately 9 of pharmacy sales by the end of fiscal 2006 

seasonality  the majority of our sales particularly pharmacy sales are generally not seasonal in nature however front store sales tend to be higher during the december holiday season for additional information we refer you to the note “quarterly financial information” on page 43 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 

working capital practices  we fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations saleleaseback transactions commercial paper and longterm borrowings for additional information on our working capital practices we refer you to the caption “liquidity  capital resources” on pages 20 and 21 in our annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 which is incorporated by reference herein due to the nature of the retail drugstore business the majority of our nonpharmacy sales are in cash while managed care and other third party insurance programs which typically settle in less than 30 days represented 94 of our pharmacy sales in 2005 our customer returns are not significant 

associate development  as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 148000 associates of which approximately 17000 were pharmacists and about 68000 were parttime employees who work less than 30 hours per week to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and partners we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards we emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization 

  

intellectual property and licenses  we have registered or applied to register for a variety of trade names service marks trademarks and business licenses for use in our business we regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in our marketing efforts we are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property our pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of pharmacy our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the federal drug enforcement administration because of these licensing and registration requirements we must comply with various statutes rules and regulations a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of these licenses or registrations 

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs and internet pharmacies 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various industry economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 

business risks  we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete with other drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies in addition the growth of mail order pharmacies and changes to pharmacy benefit plans requiring maintenance medications to be filled exclusively through mail order pharmacies continues to challenge our business 

further the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pharmacy benefit management companies government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability in that regard on january 1 2006 the new medicare part d prescription drug program went into effect it is anticipated that the program will increase utilization and decrease pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business such as cash and state medicaid customers migrate to the new medicare part d coverage the potential impact on pharmacy sales and gross margin rates is still undetermined due to the fact the program is in its early stages 

further on february 8 2006 the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of 2005 the “act” the act seeks to reduce federal spending by 36 billion over a fiveyear period by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs according to the congressional budget office retail pharmacies are expected to negotiate with individual states for higher dispensing fees to mitigate the adverse effect of these changes these changes take effect january 1 2007 and are expected to result in reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies in addition the president’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2007 contains further reductions in the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource drugs the extent of these reductions cannot be determined at this time 

economic risks  our business is affected by the economy in general and in the markets we serve including changes in consumer purchasing power andor spending patterns our ability to attract hire and retain suitable pharmacists and management personnel as well as establishing effective advertising marketing and promotional programs is directly impacted by the economic environment further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on favorable terms

retail pharmacy business 

  

operating strategy  our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important to our ability to maintain customer satisfaction 

  

products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise general merchandise categories include overthecounter drugs greeting cards film and photo finishing services beauty products and cosmetics seasonal merchandise and convenience foods which we refer to as “front store” products we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows 

  

    

pharmacy sales have been growing and we believe will continue to grow at a faster pace than front store sales pharmacy sales represented 688 of total sales in 2003 compared to 676 in 2002 and 661 in 2001 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the introduction and direct to consumer marketing of new drugs and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy success results from our investment in people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled quickly and accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology during 2003 we introduced our pharmacy service initiative “psi” this initiative ensures that customers who bring in prescriptions are greeted by a pharmacy technician who verifies insurance medication availability and refill authorizations at the point of dropoff resolving potential problems that could delay a prescription being filled further evidencing this belief is our continual investment in technology such as our excellence in pharmacy innovation and care “epic” system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill ™ and our online business cvscom 

  

front store sales should continue to benefit from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences a key component of this strategy is our extracare ® card program which is helping us to continue to build our loyal customer base with 44 million members as of january 3 2004 extracare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states extracare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks ™ rewards and more another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality private label products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 1500 cvs brand products which accounted for approximately 11 of our front store sales during 2003 in addition cvs offers a unique front store focus on cosmetics health and beauty by being a us distributor of several european cosmetics and skin care lines including lumene ®  avene ® and vichy ®  

  

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets ie market in which we did not have retail stores prior to 2000 adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2003 we opened 150 new stores relocated 125 stores and closed 58 stores our new store development during 2003 included 84 stores in new markets including chicago illinois las vegas nevada phoenix arizona and several markets in florida and texas during the last five years we opened more than 1600 new and relocated stores approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2004 we expect to open approximately 225250 new or relocated stores including approximately 100 in new markets we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry 

  

information systems  we have invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone in 2001 we completed the rollout of epic a multiyear project that reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions the project included integrated workflow improvements proprietary systems technology and automated pillcounting machines in high volume stores we expect epic will continue to improve quality assurance and customer service while reducing labor costs in 2002 we completed the rollout of our assisted inventory management “aim” system for nonpromotional front store merchandise and expanded the system to include pharmacy items in 2003 this system will more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces outofstock positions and lowers our investment in inventory

retail pharmacy business 

  

operating strategy  our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use we believe ease of use means convenience for the timestarved customer as such our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service innovation and convenience easytoaccess clean welllit and well stocked one of the keys to our strategy is technology which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services we believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important to our ability to maintain customer satisfaction

  

products  a typical cvspharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of highquality nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise general merchandise categories include overthecounter drugs greeting cards film and photo finishing services beauty products and cosmetics seasonal merchandise and convenience foods which we refer to as “front store” products we purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows

  

   

1 percentages are estimates based on store scanning data 

  

pharmacy sales have been growing and we believe will continue to grow at a faster pace than front store sales pharmacy sales represented 676 of total sales in 2002 compared to 661 in 2001 and 627 in 2000 we believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers favorable industry trends an aging american population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the introduction and direct to consumer marketing of new drugs and our ongoing program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies we believe our pharmacy success results from our investment in people and technology given the nature of prescriptions people want their prescriptions filled fast by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology our continual investment in technology such as our excellence in pharmacy innovation and care “epic” system our touchtone telephone reorder system rapid refill tm  and our online business cvscom is driven by this belief 

  

front store sales should continue to benefit from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences a key component of this strategy is our extracare® card program which is helping us to continue to build our loyal customer base with 33 million members extracare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the united states extracare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices customized coupons extrabucks tm rewards and more another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of highquality private label products that are only available through cvs we currently carry over 1500 cvs brand products which accounted for approximately 12 of our front store sales during 2002 due to the success of our private label program we continue to assess opportunities to expand our range of private label product offerings such as our cvs brand® and gold emblem® lines 

  

 

store development  the addition of new stores has played and will continue to play a major role in our continued growth and success our store development program focuses on three areas entering new markets adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient freestanding sites during 2002 we opened 174 new stores relocated 92 stores and closed 278 stores of which 224 were as a result of the strategic restructuring announced in 2001 our new store development during 2002 included 78 stores in new markets including chicago illinois las vegas nevada phoenix arizona and several markets in florida and texas during the last five years we opened more than 1700 new and relocated stores approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years during 2003 we expect to open approximately 150175 new stores including 80100 in new markets to relocate 100 stores and to close 50 stores we believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively in the current managed care environment as a result we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry

  

information systems  we have invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency we were one of the first in the industry to introduce drug utilization review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs overthecounter products vitamins and herbal remedies we were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system cvs rapid refill which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touchtone telephone in 2001 we completed the rollout of epic a multiyear project that reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions the project included integrated workflow improvements proprietary systems technology and automated pillcounting machines in high volume stores we expect epic will continue to improve quality assurance and customer service while reducing labor costs in 2002 we completed the rollout of our assisted inventory management “aim” system for nonpromotional front store merchandise this system will more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces outofstock positions and lowers our investment in inventory we also have several supply chain initiatives under way including the expansion of our aim system to include promotional merchandise

  

customers  during 2002 we served an average of 25 million customers per day since our sales are to numerous customers including managed care organizations the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on the business no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our total sales

competition  the retail drugstore business is highly competitive we believe that we compete principally on the basis of i store location and convenience ii customer service and satisfaction iii product selection and variety and iv price in each of the markets we serve we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains supermarkets convenience stores pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers discount merchandisers membership clubs and internet pharmacies
