customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 85 percent 84 percent and 83 percent of sales during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively for further information on sales by customer type contract type and geographic region see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal civil markets the boeing company general dynamics l3harris technologies lockheed martin and raytheon technologies are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards 

northrop grumman corporation 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2021 total backlog which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations was 760 billion as compared with 810 billion at december 31 2020 in connection with the it services divestiture the company reduced backlog by 14 billion during the first quarter of 2021 10 billion at defense systems 02 billion at mission systems and 02 billion at space systems for further information see “backlog” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property 

raw materials 

we have experienced challenges with access to certain raw materials due to several global events such as microelectronics shortages and covid19 nonetheless these challenges have not to date led to significant cost increases or schedule delays see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

human capital 

creating a diverse talented and inclusive workplace is central to our culture employee engagement innovation and excellence and in performing and delivering on our commitments our culture is an important factor in our ability to continue attracting and retaining qualified employees particularly those with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math this focus was a factor in our ability to hire approximately 9500 new employees in 2021 and as of december 31 2021 we have approximately 88000 employees 

additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our sustainability report and proxy statement which can be found on our company website information on our website including our sustainability report is not incorporated by reference into this annual report

northrop grumman corporation 

our annual employee survey gives employees the opportunity to provide feedback on our culture this survey is managed by a thirdparty vendor to encourage candor and solicit feedback on many aspects of engagement including company leadership culture inclusion and career development in 2021 our employee response rate was 82 percent an indication that our employees believe their feedback is important and we were named a “high performing company” by the thirdparty vendor based on our strong survey results our leaders review the survey feedback and work with their teams to take action based on survey results 

diversity equity and inclusion 

diversity equity and inclusion dei are and have long been critical to our culture and our company’s success our focus on dei enhances engagement and increases innovation and quality enabling us to deliver better performance for our shareholders customers and employees diversity is one of the company’s nonfinancial esg performance metrics and is reviewed by the board of directors across our total employee population as of december 31 2021 25 percent are female 36 percent are people of color 18 percent are veterans and 9 percent are persons with disabilities over the past 10 years at the vice president level we have more than doubled the representation of females from 16 percent to 35 percent and increased the representation of people of color by approximately 65 percent from 11 percent to 18 percent 

talent acquisition management and development 

we execute our talent management strategy with the whole employee experience in mind we utilize an employee experience continuum that focuses on key career milestones and aligns our employee development engagement and retention efforts with the specific needs of our employees throughout their careers we believe this holistic approach to talent management results in a better experience for our employees from recruiting to retirement 

we hold regular talent review discussions to ensure insight into talent at various levels of the organization succession plans are refreshed and reviewed to ensure a robust diverse pipeline of talent and business continuity with a tight linkage to development 

we design our employee development programs to strengthen employee skills aligned to our current and future business needs encourage knowledge transfer and support career growth and progression in late 2020 we launched my learning experience a machine learning enabled content aggregator designed to create a unique and personalized learning experience for each employee we offer our employees online careerspecific tools and resources and we also support development opportunities through educational institutions with our education assistance program our earlyincareer rotation program pathways develops talent pipelines with both depth of skills and breadth of experiences that are critical to the company’s future talent needs our technical cohort programs are designed to cultivate technical domain expertise and collaborative thought leadership for early through advanced career levels 

as our company continues to grow we rely on an integrated talent acquisition program the company strategically attracts identifies and onboards candidates in support of business needs and priorities in order to accomplish our goals we seek talent with different perspectives skills and experiences maintain strategic relationships with colleges offer a robust employee referral program and partner with numerous diversity organizations military organizations and our trusted external partners the company continues to monitor the evolving hiring environment while applying agile recruiting methods to ensure employees and candidates have an exceptional experience 

employee health and safety 

people are our most valuable resource and we work diligently to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees customers visitors and others at our facilities during 2021 we have taken and continue to take robust actions in response to the covid19 pandemic to help protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and others see “covid19” in mda for further discussion 

health and safety are a core focus in everything we do risk and hazard identification abatement and prevention are key components of northrop grumman’s safety program everyone has a responsibility to identify workplace hazards and we empower employees to report these hazards without fear of repercussion we evaluate the effectiveness of our health and safety programs externally through benchmarking with industry peers and the us bureau of labor statistics internally we determine program effectiveness by conducting trend analyses of our past performance 

collective agreements

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

we are prohibited by the us government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs these programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas which are regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with applicable far and cas requirements include but are not limited to unallowable employee compensation charitable donations interest expense advertising and certain legal costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two contract types 

costtype contracts – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

fixedprice contracts – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development lowrate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and “risk factors” for further information regarding our contracts and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type 

northrop grumman corporation 

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2021 recognized by contract type and customer category 



1 sales to the us government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the us government each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the us government 

2 international sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer these sales include foreign military sales contracted through the us government 

environmental 

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment in 2015 we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels to reduce potable water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels and to achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate away from landfills in 2021 we measured our performance against these goals and exceeded our greenhouse gas goal by reducing emissions 44 percent and met our potable water reduction goal of 20 percent we made strong progress in increasing our solid waste diversion from landfills achieving a 69 percent diversion rate falling just short of our goal we were challenged by changes in collection methods and waste haulers at some sites related in some cases to covid19 we are continuing our commitment to climate and environmental sustainability and are in the process of finalizing the next generation of goals for 2022 and beyond 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments see “risk factors” and notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

industry and economic risks 

▪ we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for a substantial portion of our business changes in this customer’s priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 85 percent of our sales in 2021 we have a number of large programs with the us department of the air force in particular the us government has the ability to delay modify or cancel ongoing competitions procurements and programs as well as to change its future acquisition strategy we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in the threat environment defense spending levels government priorities political leadership procurement practices and strategy military strategy and planning or broader changes in social economic or political demands and priorities 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned in the event of termination due to default contractors may be required to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience the us government has invoked and could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages often introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which contractors may not be able to negotiate full recovery in some cases they have also ultimately resulted and could result in termination of a contract for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities programs or acquisition strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and us government funding more broadly can negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations when we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we are generally at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations ultimately approved or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the federal debt limit have adversely affected and could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract for such programs has at times been and in the future may be terminated or adjusted by the government or prime contractor 

the us continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding the budget environment and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes 

northrop grumman corporation 

and the debt ceiling remain significant short and longterm risks see “overview – us political and economic environment” in mda considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets and we may face a government shutdown of unknown duration if a prolonged government shutdown of the dod were to occur it could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders and could limit the us government’s ability to progress programs and make timely payments and our ability to perform on our us government contracts and successfully compete for new work if the statutory debt limit is not increased adequately we could be obligated to work without receiving timely payments 

future funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could continue to adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas for future defense spending changing priorities budget pressures defense spending cuts challenges in the appropriations process the debt ceiling and ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our current and future programs longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ we use estimates when accounting for contracts contract cost growth or changes in estimated contract revenues and costs can affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also considered 

our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase reasons for increased estimated contract costs include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work including technical or quality issues or requests for additional work production challenges including those resulting from the timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor the availability performance and quality of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components changes in laws or regulations actions necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we have filed and may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs and aim to protect against these risks through contract terms and conditions when practical but the government may disagree with our requests and may not have funding to cover them 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than costtype contracts including as a result of inflationary pressures labor shortages and increased labor rates in 2021 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we have typically looked to fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for production programs however our customers may also seek fixedprice contracts for development programs where the risks are greater in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if we do not achieve our estimates or meet terms specified in our contracts our profitability has at times been and may be reduced and we have incurred and may incur losses 

certain of our fixedprice contracts include or may include fixedprice development work this work is inherently more uncertain and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in adjustments 

under costtype contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are uncertain and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily 

northrop grumman corporation 

in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise we also face additional financial risk due to the number of contract solicitations requiring the contractor to bid on costtype development work and related fixedprice production lots andor options in one submission or costtype development work requiring the contractor to provide certain items to the customer at the contractor’s expense or at little or no fee 

we also face the risk that contracts do not or will not enable full recovery of costs incurred as a result of or related to the covid19 pandemic 

because of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of our contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

▪ competition within our markets and bid protests may affect our ability to win new contracts and result in reduced revenues and market share 

we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms including new entrants we are also facing increasing competition for and more limited access to various critical products services and other supplies including related to scarcity of resources and mergers and acquisitions in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer some customers including the dod are turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services and continue to utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally in addition our success in competing and remaining costcompetitive depends in part on our ability successfully to adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technologies into our products and services 

bid protests can result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

▪ we are subject to various investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us 

the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions prosecutions litigation and other legal proceedings particularly those involving governments which have at times been and may continue to be increasingly aggressive we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions and administrative civil or criminal litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts commercial transactions false claims false statements antitrust compliance with government orders mischarging contract performance fraud procurement integrity securities laws and requirements products liability warranties hazardous materials personal injury claims environmental shareholder derivative actions acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property tax corporate law and obligations employees exportimport anticorruption debt and equity labor health and safety the covid19 pandemic and the company’s response to it accidents launch failures and employee benefits and plans including plan administration improper payments and issues related to privacy and security cyber and physical as well as matters relating to the orbital atk federal trade commission ftc decision and order see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the orbital 

northrop grumman corporation 

atk ftc decision and order and subsequent interactions with ftc staff these matters can divert financial and management resources result in administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including judgments convictions consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements compensatory treble or other damages nonmonetary relief or other liabilities and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of exportimport privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute enforcement action or litigation even if pending or not ultimately substantiated or if fully indemnified or insured can also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business obtain and retain awards ensure funding for our programs or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ the improper conduct of employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or joint ventures in which we participate can impact our reputation our ability to do business and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information false claims procurement integrity cost accounting and billing competition information security and data privacy or the terms of our contracts however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct despite a vigorous compliance program and strong culture this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally with greater opportunities and demands to do more business with local and new partners at the same time law enforcement agencies are continuing to focus on combating global corruption and other misconduct in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures with that term used throughout to refer to joint efforts or business arrangements of any type notwithstanding our robust process we are unable to prevent any and all misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by our employees or those with whom or through whom we do business subjects us to risk of administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties liabilities and the loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ as a us government contractor we and our partners are subject to various procurement and other laws regulations and contract terms applicable to our industry as well as those more broadly applicable and we could be adversely affected by changes in such laws regulations or terms or any negative findings by the us government as to our compliance with them we also may be adversely affected by changes in our customers’ business practices globally 

us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements as well as ones more broadly applicable these regulations and other requirements although sometimes customary in government contracting increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving these costs are not always fully recoverable new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example related to cybersecurity information protection cost accounting covid19 recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts pensions antihuman trafficking and use of certain nonus equipment can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and accounting and our compliance with applicable laws regulations terms and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded when an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we are subject to possible civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal 

northrop grumman corporation 

activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems to be inadequate with significant financial impact regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition we risk serious reputational harm in situations involving allegations of impropriety made against us or our business partners 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally largely as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to our claims and our government accounting business systems for current and past years as well as a lengthened period of time required to close open audits an increased number of broad requests for information and an increased risk of withholding of payments for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs including certain costs related to environmental remediation and pensions and certain assumptions used by the company to determine pension expense are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be among others have affected and may in the future affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal state and local laws regulations contract terms and requirements related to our industry our products and the businesses we operate as well as those more broadly applicable to industry such as securities laws these laws and regulations include but are not limited to the truthful cost or pricing data act false claims act procurement integrity act federal communications commission act cas far international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act export administration regulations promulgated under the export control reform act international sanctions close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar anticorruption provisions as well as orders rules and regulations administered by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and those related to pandemics these requirements whether specific to our industry or broadly applicable may limit our conduct and ability to achieve our goals if we are found to have violated any such requirements including both those specific to our business and those more broadly applicable or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of exportimport privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly including with respect to allowable costs it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ environmental matters including unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts and government and third party claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed or enforced differently over time compliance with these environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including suspension and debarment for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource 

northrop grumman corporation 

damages a determination that certain remediation or other environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including individual and class actions relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages remediation costs fines penalties and nonmonetary relief and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage 

the company is engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur as included in note 12 substantial remediation costs related to the legacy bethpage environmental conditions it is also possible that applicable remediation allocation and allowability standards and other claims and requirements to which we are subject may continue to change and our costs may increase materially in december 2020 the parties reached a tentative agreement with the state of new york regarding the steps the company will take to implement the state’s amended record of decision and to resolve certain other potential claims including for natural resource damages we understand that the state will next seek court approval of the consent decree we are also in discussions with the dod navy and dcma and the bethpage and south farmingdale water districts to explore whether claims involving these parties can be resolved at this stage in addition to disputes and legal proceedings with government entities related to environmental conditions at the site including remediation allocation and allowability we are a party to various and may become a party to disputes and legal proceedings with individual and class action plaintiffs alleging personal injury and property damage with insurance carriers and with other parties 

in addition at times government and private parties seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which we believe other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us federal state and local or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect have affected and could continue to affect our tax expense and profitability as for example they did in 2017 upon passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition the final determination of any state or federal tax audits or related litigation in particular with regard to the sustainment of our positions on research credits and timing of revenue recognition under irc section 451b could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as a result of the acquisition of oatk in 2018 we are subject to outstanding tax audits and may be subject to future tax audits and legal challenges involving oatk and its subsidiaries their successors the spinoff of its then subsidiary vista outdoor inc vista in 2015 and related matters oatk entered into a tax matters agreement with vista pursuant to which in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations vista is required to indemnify oatk against taxes on the spinoff however there are circumstances pursuant to which we may be unable to obtain an indemnification payment or we may be required to indemnify vista 

beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tcja” eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to irc section 174 although congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in 2022 

changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations the interpretation or application thereof or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

business and operational risks 

▪ we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks which may have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks especially of infectious diseases including covid19 since first reported in late 2019 the covid19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases and deaths business slowdowns or shutdowns labor shortages supply chain challenges changes in government spending and requirements regulatory challenges inflationary pressures and market volatility although we have to date managed to continue most of our operations we cannot predict the future course of events nor can we assure that this global pandemic including its economic impact will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows for further information relating to the evolving environment our experience to date and various steps taken related to the covid19 pandemic see mda 

our operations have been and we expect will continue to be further impacted by the covid19 pandemic the pandemic likely will continue to impact our workforce including staffing levels as a result of illnesses quarantine isolation and absenteeism and adjusted work locations and schedules our facilities and access to them those with whom we do business and on whom we rely to continue our operations travel restrictions and overall our ability to perform as required at cost and on schedule and to achieve and increase efficiencies the pandemic may require us to continue to take extraordinary measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs which may not be fully recoverable if going forward significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively or we are otherwise unable to maintain our level of operations staffing and performance we can expect facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages and adverse impacts on our overall performance operations and financial results the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic including a tightened labor market and government requirements including those related to vaccinations will also likely continue to affect our company they may further affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce to maintain performance levels especially cost and schedule and to maintain our corporate culture we expect to continue to incur additional costs as a result of the covid19 outbreak including to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees to respond to government requirements and as a result of impacts on operations and performance including staffing and schedule which costs we may not be fully able to recover we are and may be subject to additional regulatory requirements enforcement actions and litigation again with costs and liabilities that are not fully recoverable or insured 

the continued global pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact the company’s supply chains if our suppliers have increased challenges with their workforce including as a result of illness absenteeism reactions to health and safety or government requirements facility closures timely access to necessary components materials and other supplies at reasonable prices access to capital and access to fundamental support services such as shipping and transportation they may be unable to provide the agreedupon goods and services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs and delays in our business including as a result of higher prices schedule delays or the need to identify and develop alternative suppliers and we may need to provide additional resources to support our suppliers or otherwise continue performance under our contracts in some instances we may be unable to do that incurring additional liabilities under our current contracts and hampering new ones 

the global covid19 crisis has put extraordinary pressures on the us government and governments around the world in some cases it has caused delays or limits in the ability of the government and other customers including other prime contractors to perform including making timely payments and awards to us negotiating contracts and agreeing on appropriate costs for recovery performing quality inspections supporting testing accepting delivery approving security clearances for individuals and facilities and providing necessary personnel equipment and facilities in addition as a result of the covid19 crisis we expect continued changes in our customers’ priorities and practices as our customers in both the us and globally confront competing budget priorities staffing challenges and limited resources these changes may impact current and future programs customer priorities government payments and other practices procurements and funding decisions 

while we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed and uncommitted credit lines a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect both our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives additionally there can be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades and such downgrades could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets market volatility may also impact investment performance and our expected asset valuations and returns 

northrop grumman corporation 

which could materially impact the calculation of longterm liabilities such as our pension obligations and inflationary pressures related to covid19 could adversely affect our business further including through increased cost of labor and materials on our contracts 

we continue to work with our stakeholders in an effort to address responsibly this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our employees business supply chain and customers and to take certain actions in an effort to mitigate various adverse consequences 

we expect that the longer the covid19 pandemic including its economic disruption continues the greater the adverse impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations could be given the tremendous uncertainties and variables we cannot at this time predict the impact of the global covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic but any one could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions 

as a defense contractor we face significant cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to and to harm sensitive information and networks insider threats ransomware threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security and viability of our facilities infrastructure products and subcontractors or others in our supply chain referred to inclusively as suppliers and threats from terrorist acts civil unrest or other acts of aggression we are also subject to increasing government customer and other cyber and security requirements including disclosure obligations 

we have robust measures in place to address and mitigate cyberrelated risks however we have experienced cyber attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future we continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and products and to enhance our internal controls and processes which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure these include timely detection of incidents through monitoring training incident response capabilities and mitigating cyber and security risks to our data systems technology and products and services however these efforts may not be fully effective 

our customers and partners including our suppliers and joint ventures with whom we do business and entrust confidential data and on whom we rely to provide products and services face similar threats and growing requirements including ones for which others may seek to hold us responsible we depend on our customers suppliers and other business partners to implement adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cyber incidents if they fail to do so we may suffer financial and other harm including to our information operations performance employees customers and reputation 

although we implement various measures and controls to monitor and mitigate risks associated with these threats and to increase the cyber resiliency of our infrastructure and products there can be no assurance that these processes will be sufficient successful attacks could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities theft or corruption of data harm to personnel infrastructure or products financial costs and liabilities protracted interruptions in our operations and performance and the misuse of our products as well as damage to our reputation as a government contractor and provider of cyberrelated or cyberprotected goods and services 

cyber threats both on premises and in the cloud are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data disruption to operations critical systems or denial of service attacks unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners corruption of data networks or systems harm to individuals and loss of assets in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products or services we use or in our internal partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business some of these threats are zeroday attacks associated with unknown third party software or product vulnerabilities these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we also face threats to our physical security including to our facilities and the safety and wellbeing of our people these threats could involve terrorism insider threats workplace violence civil unrest natural disasters damaging weather fires or similar acts which could adversely affect our company our customers and suppliers face similar risks that if realized could also adversely impact our operations the business impact of such acts could include delays manufacturing downtime and other impacts that could detrimentally impact our ability to perform our operations we could also incur unanticipated costs to remediate impacts loss of business and ability to win new business which could adversely impact our cash flow financial condition or results of operations 

northrop grumman corporation 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

we also face increasing disclosure obligations related to cyber and other security events despite rigorous processes we risk failing to meet all of our disclosure obligations andor having our disclosures misinterpreted 

the occurrence and impact of these various risks and considerations are difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss or corruption of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business disruption in our business contractual or regulatory actions and liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends in part on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 

our operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math and who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture outside the us it is increasingly important that we are also able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience we are facing increased competition for talent both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies and increasing wage rates if qualified personnel are more scarce or more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are increasingly unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we would expect higher laborrelated costs and we could face challenges performing on various of our programs in addition the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic including a tightened labor market and government requirements including those related to vaccinations may further affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and to maintain performance levels and our corporate culture these challenges may be further compounded by an increase in remote work there is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity equity and inclusion objectives or more broadly to meet sustainability goals increasingly required by our shareholders employees and other stakeholders 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or new demands or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages slowdowns or other laborrelated disruptions any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

• our earnings and profitability depend in part on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials chemicals and components and subsystems for our products produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property provide information about the parts they supply to us and perform some of the services we need for our operations or provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms while maintaining strong values and cultures disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors or other suppliers referred to inclusively as suppliers failure to meet regulatory or contractual requirements unethical behavior or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our suppliers have had and may continue to have various adverse impacts on the company including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time is adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon products materials or information or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract or applicable regulations changes in political or economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or sanctions or other changes impacting a supplier as well as their ability to retain talent and other resources and requirements imposed on them by other customers has adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the financial stability of our suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform adequately has 

northrop grumman corporation 

resulted in and could in the future result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers if available which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers this risk increases as the demands grow for our suppliers to meet extensive governmentrelated cyber and other requirements 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer among many other examples we require assured access to microelectronics our ability to produce andor deliver products will be significantly impacted if the microelectronics manufacturing supply chain is cut off or significantly delayed we also are facing increased regulatory requirements both domestically and internationally many of which apply to our suppliers as a prime we are often responsible for not only our compliance with these regulatory requirements but that of our suppliers too in some cases there has been only one supplier or one domestic supplier for certain components if a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available including if a supplier is impacted by shipping and logistics delays we may be unable to find a suitable alternative and to meet our obligations 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and contract terms including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws including cybersecurity and related certification requirements 

if our suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in deliveries of needed products materials or services or if they do not comply with all applicable laws regulations requirements and contract terms including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

• risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus and evolving views of our customers shareholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues could negatively affect our business and operations 

the effects of climate change create short and longterm financial risks to our business both in the us and globally we have significant operations located in regions that have been and may in the future be exposed to significant weather events and other natural disasters climate related changes can increase variability in or otherwise impact natural disasters including weather patterns with the potential for increased frequency and severity of significant weather events eg flooding hurricanes and tropical storms natural hazards eg increased wildfire risk rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns eg drought desertification andor poor water quality for example in recent years our facilities in lake charles la and melbourne fl were damaged by hurricanes which temporarily interrupted site operations and had significant adverse impacts on our employees their families and the local communities we expect climate change will continue to affect our facilities operations employees and communities in the future particularly at facilities in coastal areas and areas prone to extreme weather events and water scarcity our suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under our contracts including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical infrastructure disruptions also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs 

increased worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions new or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change related concerns may adversely affect us our suppliers and our customers some of our facilities are for example engaged in manufacturing processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide or rely on products from others that do so we have worked for years to reduce our reliance on fossilbased energy sources to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions to reduce our consumption of water and production of waste and to ensure our compliance with environmental regulations where we operate enhancing our record of environmental sustainability however new and evolving laws and regulations could mandate different or more restrictive standards could require capital investments to transition to low carbon technologies could adversely impact our ongoing operations and could require changes on a more accelerated time frame our suppliers may face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results 

northrop grumman corporation 

of operations and financial condition and noncompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements could also negatively impact our reputation and ability to do business 

in may 2021 the administration issued executive order 14030 climaterelated financial risk directing the far council in consultation with the chair of the council on environmental quality to consider amendments to the far to help ensure that major federal agency procurements reduce the risk of climate change including requiring the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions to be considered in procurement decisions amendments to the far andor other changes to contract terms could cause us to incur additional operating and compliance costs directly and from our suppliers or otherwise impact our ability to win business and operate successfully 

changes in our customers’ requirements priorities and ways of doing business are also likely to have an impact on our business operations and financial success these changes create opportunities and risks if for example our customers develop requirements and adopt procurement policies that place further emphasis on social and environmental objectives and we are unable to meet those evolving demands we will be less successful in selling our products winning new business and growing our revenues 

investors advisory services government regulators lenders and other market participants have focused increasingly on the environmental or “sustainability” practices of companies shareholders financial institutions and others have increasingly looked to a company’s environmental social and governance practices disclosures and performance before making investment or other financial decisions regulators have been increasing requirements and enforcement activities we believe our practices disclosures and performance are strong and growing however if they do not meet investor lender regulator or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our access to capital may be negatively impacted including in both the equity and debt markets and we will be adversely affected an enforcement action could harm our reputation financial position and ability to grow a failure to meet expectations may materially negatively affect our results of operations ability to manage our liquidity or implement our strategies 

the company is building on its environmental record with a particular focus on the reduction of carbon emissions from our operations and a target date to achieve net zero carbon emissions the company is committed to working to achieve its climate change related objectives however the costs of doing so may be greater than expected and there can be no assurance the company will achieve its objectives or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors or other external stakeholders any failure to achieve our goals a perception that we are not responsible environmental stewards or failure effectively to respond to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business reputation or financial position 

the effects and costs of climate change or other related environmental concerns or any failure to meet related requirements and expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our international business exposes us to additional risks including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors laws and regulations 

sales to customers outside the us are an important component of our strategy our international business including our participation in joint ventures requirements for local content and our global supply chain is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if and as our international business continues to grow 

our international business is generally subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation laws and regulations relating to exportimport controls sanctions technology transfers government contracts and procurement data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the fcpa and other anticorruption laws antiboycott provisions securities laws labor and employment works councils and other labor groups antihuman trafficking taxes environment immunity security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative civil commercial or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of exportimport privileges our customers outside of the us also often have the ability to terminate contracts for convenience as well as for default based on performance suspension or debarment or termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

northrop grumman corporation 

new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally despite robust processes we also face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products and resources 

changes in laws regulations political leadership and environment political relations and instability andor security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct profitable business in international markets including sales to customers outside the us and purchases from suppliers outside the us our international business is impacted by changes in us and foreign national policies and priorities and geopolitical relationships any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment political leadership geopolitical uncertainties world events government budgets and economic and political factors more generally any of these factors may impact funding for programs our ability to perform our supply chain export authorizations purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the residual impacts of britain’s exit from the european union the full impacts of which are still evolving global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit could further impact our business 

our contracts with nonus customers in some cases also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases hiring of local nationals local investments manufacturing or other operational or financial obligations including offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements they may also require us to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees andor other financial arrangements to secure our obligations we also are dependent on incountry suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts and applicable laws particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations the us government can deny change or revoke export authorization our business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business more broadly our ability effectively to pursue and execute contracts outside the us may be impacted by our ability to partner successfully with nonus companies including through joint ventures teaming agreements coproduction or other arrangements this risk includes the ability to timely identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with local partners potential exposure for their actions and the ability to effectively terminate these partnership arrangements this risk may increase depending on local requirements regarding who we partner with and under what circumstances particularly where we partner with governmentaffiliated entities 

the products and services we provide including those provided by suppliers and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts different business practices andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees suppliers or other third parties and increase our risk to a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require stateoftheart manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet our contractual obligations could adversely affect our profitability reputation and future prospects 

we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments including highly demanding operating conditions to accomplish challenging missions problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology research and development funding intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions operation of artificial intelligence inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components or subcontractor or other supplier performance can prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations can negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement unintended explosions problems with design quality and workmanship country 

northrop grumman corporation 

of origin of procured materials inadequate supplier components and degradation of product performance these failures can result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property factors that may affect revenue and profitability include inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses diversion of management focus loss of followon work replacement obligations and repayment to the government customer of certain contract cost and fee payments previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we are generally required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

we have significant operations including centers of excellence located in regions that have been and may in the future be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes water levels wildfires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and other suppliers have also been and may in the future be subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters the nature frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change and delays in recovery may be significant 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ we provide products and services including related to hazardous and high risk operations which subjects us to various environmental regulatory financial reputational and other risks 

we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services we use and provide energetic materials and solid rocket motors including products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements we develop missile systems and counter systems including strategic deterrents as well as subsystems and components all of these and other activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including 1 potential liabilities relating to nuclear or launchrelated incidents unintended initiation of energetic materials and explosions including risk of personal injury property damage and environmental harm 2 to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and 3 to failed launches we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear launch or explosive incident or other hazardous operation whether or not the cause was within our control and insurance may not be reasonably available under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 10 usc 2354 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks but those protections may not be available and they are limited in scope 

certain of our products such as small medium and large caliber ammunition and solid rocket motors and liquid propulsion engines involve the use manufacture andor handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials these activities have resulted and may result in incidents that cause workplace injuries and fatalities the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing production delays environmental harm and expense fines and liability to third parties we have safety and loss prevention programs which provide for preconstruction reviews along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials to attempt to mitigate some such incidents as well as potentially insurance coverage we and our customers may experience similar or more serious incidents in the future which could result in various liabilities and production delays 

in addition our customers may use or misuse our products and services in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky or in ways that are not intended creating potential liabilities for our company as the provider of the products 

northrop grumman corporation 

and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or as intended or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities an incident related to the use of energetics or rocket motors or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available to cover our losses and liabilities it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ we may be unable fully to exploit or adequately to protect intellectual property rights which could materially affect our ability to compete our reputation and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms increasing demands from our customers to access and obtain rights in our intellectual property and positions taken by our suppliers and competitors challenge our ability to exploit protect and access intellectual property 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and at times seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they are entitled to do so governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could reduce our ability to develop protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into intellectual property agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants teammates and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts requires us to access and use third party intellectual property this requires that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly with third parties to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms that may not be practicable 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be favorable 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and new technologies and maintain technologies facilities and equipment to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers 

many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally in addition our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends on continued funding for and investment in research and development projects our success also depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency our customers and markets also increasingly require us to be agile and efficient digitally 

northrop grumman corporation 

enabled and able to harness integrated digital technologies and capabilities to deliver solutions with the agility and affordability that our customers seek if we are unable to continue to develop new products and technologies in a timely fashion and successfully to effect digital transformation or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share and on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

general and other risk factors 

▪ our insurance coverage customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of or be unable to pay for material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position 

we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid responsible highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters space launches and onorbit operations cyber security hazardous operations energetics and products liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are or should be insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available at times we are not able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us or without increasing exclusions disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers has affected and may continue to affect the availability or timing of recovery and our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are difficult to negotiate and obtain are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover losses or liabilities incurred if insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ pension and other postretirement benefit opb obligations and related expenses and funding requirements may fluctuate significantly depending upon investment performance of plan assets changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions 

the company’s pension and opb obligations and related expenses are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates mortality and the estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets investment performance of plan assets and changes in assumptions associated with our pension and opb plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

funding requirements for our pension plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when they are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences as well as government challenges to pension and opb cost recovery could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ business investments andor recorded goodwill and other longlived assets may become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

goodwill accounts for approximately 41 percent of our total assets as of december 31 2021 although we currently have excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values changes in business conditions or in the marketbased inputs used in our goodwill impairment test could result in significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations

covid19 

covid19 was first reported in late 2019 in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a global pandemic and the president declared a national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak in the almost two years since then the pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases and deaths business slowdowns or shutdowns labor shortfalls supply chain challenges regulatory challenges and market volatility we discussed in some detail in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 and subsequent sec filings in 2021 the pandemic its impacts and risks and actions taken up to the time of each filing in this form 10k we provide a further update 

the company’s leadership our crisis management and business resumption teams and local site leadership continue closely to monitor and address the pandemic and related developments including the impact on our company our employees our customers our suppliers and our communities the company has considered and continues to consider and be guided by health data and evolving guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in particular as well as other health organizations globally federal state and local governmental authorities and our customers among others we have taken and continue to take robust actions to help protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees to support continued performance to support our suppliers and local communities and to continue to serve our customers our goals have been and continue to be to lessen the potential adverse impacts both health and economic and to continue to position the company for longterm success like the communities in which we operate our actions have varied depending on the spread of covid19 and applicable government requirements the needs of our employees the needs of our customers and the needs of our business 

over the course of 2021 covid19 case rates and the health and economic impacts of the pandemic fluctuated dramatically in different communities in the us and globally particularly with the spread of new variants but we continued to see a prolonged impact on the economy our industry and our company with increased challenges for customers and suppliers labor shortages supply chain challenges and increasing inflation among other impacts we expect these and other impacts to continue and they could worsen depending on the future course of the pandemic and actions taken in connection with it 

in the us the food and drug administration issued emergency use authorization for covid19 vaccines and the government began extensive efforts to administer them the company also has taken various steps to encourage and facilitate vaccination access for our employees in accordance with federal guidance we have provided paid leave and flexibility for employees to get vaccinated and strongly encouraged our workforce to take care of themselves and their colleagues in september 2021 the white house issued an executive order and guidance from the safer federal workforce task force broadly requiring many usbased federal contractors to be fully vaccinated by december 8 2021 or to have an approved accommodation in early november 2021 the federal government extended that deadline to january 18 2022 on december 7 2021 a federal district judge issued an order temporarily suspending the government from enforcing the federal contractor mandate that order is on appeal state and local governments are also taking actions related to the pandemic imposing additional and varying requirements on industry we have taken and are taking steps strongly to encourage our employees to be fully vaccinated or to have an approved accommodation to protect our workplace and to position the company to comply with the executive order guidance and related contract terms if and as necessary as we continue to evaluate the evolving situation and our customers’ requirements evolving government requirements including regarding a vaccine mandate along with the broader impacts of the continuing pandemic could significantly impact 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

our workforce and performance as well as those of our suppliers and result in costs that we may not be able to recover fully the company continues to take robust actions globally to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and to serve our customers with continued performance we also continue to take steps to support our suppliers with a particular focus on critical small and midsized business partners including passing through increased progress payments from the dod to our suppliers and accelerating payments to certain suppliers 

the company’s fourth quarter 2021 revenue and operating income were affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company and the broader economic environment including through a tightened labor market elevated levels of employee leave evolving government requirements and supply chain challenges these factors are expected to continue and could worsen and affect further our ability and that of our suppliers to maintain a qualified workforce and to perform fully for our customers including with respect to cost and schedule with delayed or reduced sales and additional liabilities losses and costs that we may not be able to recover fully our employees customers and suppliers the company our economy and our global community face both continuing and new or evolving challenges related to the pandemic and we cannot predict how this dynamic situation will evolve or the impact it will have on the company or our financial position results of operations andor cash flows for further information on the pandemic and the potential impact to the company of covid19 see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” below and “risk factors” 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors including major global powers as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions diverse regional security concerns and political instability global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

the global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2022 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility and the covid19 pandemic the global economy may also be affected by the residual legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s exit from the european union the full impacts of which are complex and gradually becoming evident rising inflation also could lead to increased interest rates raising the cost of borrowing for the federal government which could impact other spending priorities additionally economic tensions and changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements could impact the global market for defense products services and solutions

on may 28 2021 the administration released its budget request for fy 2022 the budget proposed 753 billion for national defense programs and 770 billion in nondefense discretionary funding it continues to be the subject of debate in congress the administration’s budget request included funding for an infrastructure and economic recovery plan and an education and economic support plan on november 15 2021 the president signed into law the 12 trillion infrastructure and investment and jobs act enactment of the infrastructure plan and any future spending plans as well as the costs of the pandemic as discussed more above may have broader implications for the defense industry our customers’ budgets and priorities and the overall economic environment including the national debt it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets however the threat to us national security remains very substantial we believe that our capabilities particularly in space missiles missile defense hypersonics counterhypersonics survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers defend against future threats and as a result continue to allow for longterm profitable growth in our business 

fy 2022 appropriations have not been enacted to date on september 30 2021 a continuing resolution was enacted providing funding generally at fy 2021 levels through december 3 2021 the continuing resolution was further extended through february 18 2022 congressional deliberations over fy 2022 appropriations have demonstrated broad support for national security with increased funding proposed in certain areas for national defense above the administration’s budget request it remains uncertain whether and if so when the government will approve fy 2022 appropriations with which programs funded at what levels and for how long the government will operate under a continuing resolution with potential impacts on our programs and new starts in particular

the bipartisan budget act of 2019 suspended the debt ceiling through july 31 2021 in october 2021 the statutory debt limit was increased by 480 billion and in december 2021 was further increased by 25 trillion which is currently expected to allow the treasury department to finance the government into 2023 

the political environment federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular 

for further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment see “risk factors” 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically larger contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts as control is transferred to the customer primarily over time on a costtocost basis cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to the applicable far and cas requirements that govern our us government business most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor subcontractor material overhead and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance andor contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels and performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type andor life cycle eg costtype fixedprice development production andor sustainment 

consolidated operating results 

for purposes of the operating results discussion below we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” or “fas” organic sales is defined as total sales excluding sales attributable to the companys it services divestiture this measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying sales growth as well as in providing an understanding of our ongoing business and future sales trends by presenting the company’s sales before the impact of divestiture activity 

transactionadjusted net earnings and transactionadjusted earnings per share transactionadjusted eps exclude impacts related to the it services divestiture including the gain on sale of the business associated federal and state income tax expenses transaction costs and the makewhole premium for early debt redemption they also exclude the impact of marktomarket pension and opb “mtm” benefitexpense and related tax impacts which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the nonoperational impact of divestiture activity and pension and opb actuarial gains and losses these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of the it services divestiture and mtm accounting are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards 

we reconcile these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below these nongaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

the tables below reconcile sales to organic sales 





2021 sales decreased 11 billion or 3 percent due to a 22 billion reduction in sales related to the it services divestiture 2021 organic sales increased 10 billion or 3 percent due to higher sales at space and mission systems partially offset by lower sales at aeronautics systems and defense systems 2020 sales included a 444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at aeronautics systems 

see “segment operating results” below for further information by segment and “product and service analysis” for product and service detail see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type contract type and geographic region for each of our segments 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating income and margin rate 

2021 operating income increased 16 billion or 39 percent primarily due to the it services divestiture including the 20 billion pretax gain on sale and 192 million of unallocated corporate expense for unallowable state taxes and transaction costs partially offset by a 288 million reduction in the fascas operating adjustment lower nondivestiturerelated unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by higher deferred state taxes principally related to the company’s 2021 mtm benefit 2021 operating margin rate increased to 158 percent from 110 percent reflecting the items above 

2021 ga costs as a percentage of sales increased to 101 percent from 93 percent primarily due to an increase in investments for future business opportunities and a lower ga cost mix in the divested it services business 

for further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses see “product and service analysis” below 

marktomarket pension and opb benefitexpense 

the primary components of pretax mtm benefit expense are presented in the table below 



2021 mtm benefit of 24 billion was primarily driven by a 30 basis point increase in the discount rate from year end 2020 and actual net plan asset returns of approximately 109 percent compared to our 75 percent asset return assumption 

federal and foreign income taxes 

the 2021 effective tax rate etr increased to 216 percent from 145 percent in the prior year period primarily due to federal income taxes resulting from the it services divestiture including 250 million of income tax expense related to 12 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business the company’s 2021 mtm benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 etr however mtm expense in 2020 reduced the 2020 etr by 13 percentage points see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

net earnings 

the table below reconciles net earnings to transactionadjusted net earnings 



1 the deferred state tax impact was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 525 percent in 2021 and 2020 and 450 percent in 2019 and is included in unallocated corporate expense within operating income 

2 the federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from mtm benefit expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate 

3 the state tax impact includes 62 million of incremental tax expense related to 12 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business 

4 the federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes 250 million of incremental tax expense related to 12 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business 

2021 net earnings increased 38 billion or 120 percent principally due to a 25 billion increase in our mtm benefit net of tax and a 11 billion increase associated with the it services divestiture net of tax transactionadjusted net earnings increased 160 million or 4 percent primarily due to lower unallocated corporate expense and higher segment operating income partially offset by higher income tax expense 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

diluted earnings per share 

the table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to transactionadjusted eps 



1 the deferred state tax impact was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 525 percent in 2021 and 2020 and 450 percent in 2019 and is included in unallocated corporate expense within operating income 

2 the federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from mtm benefit expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate 

3 the state tax impact includes 62 million of incremental tax expense related to 12 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business 

4 the federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes 250 million of incremental tax expense related to 12 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business 

2021 diluted earnings per share increased 2451 or 129 percent principally due to a 1557 increase in our 2021 mtm benefit net of tax and a 696 increase associated with the it services divestiture net of tax transactionadjusted eps increased 198 or 8 percent reflecting a 4 percent increase in transactionadjusted net earnings and a 4 percent decrease in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

the company is aligned in four operating sectors which also comprise our reportable segments aeronautics systems defense systems mission systems and space systems for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see “business” 

we present our sectors in the following business areas which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities 

effective during the first quarter of 2021 within mission systems the businesses of the former cims business area that remained with northrop grumman after the it services divestiture were merged with the communications business unit and f35 communications navigation and identification programs within the former airborne sensors  networks business area to form the networked information solutions business area the airborne sensors  networks business area was then renamed the airborne multifunction sensors business area to better reflect its new portfolio this change had no impact on the segment operating results of mission systems as a whole 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rate a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below 

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the table below and segment operating margin rate segment operating income divided by sales are nongaap measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under far and cas and excludes fas pension service expense and unallocated corporate items certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable far and cas requirements and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors these measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 



1 represents the deferred state tax benefit associated with mtm benefit expense which is recorded in unallocated corporate expense consistent with other changes in deferred state taxes 

segment operating income and margin rate 

2021 segment operating income increased 29 million or 1 percent higher operating income at space systems and mission systems was driven by increased volume and improved performance lower operating income at defense systems is due to the impact of the it services divestiture and lower operating income at aeronautics systems principally relates to net unfavorable eac adjustments on f35 2021 segment operating income from the it services business was 20 million as compared to 247 million in 2020 segment operating income includes a first quarter 2021 benefit of approximately 100 million due to the impact of lower overhead rates on the company’s fixed price contracts segment operating margin rate increased to 118 percent from 114 percent and reflects higher operating margin rates at mission systems defense systems and space systems 

fascas operating adjustment 

the decrease in our 2021 fascas operating adjustment is due to lower cas pension expense resulting from favorable plan asset returns in 2020 and changes in certain cas actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2020 

unallocated corporate income expense 

the increase in 2021 unallocated corporate income expense is primarily due to a 20 billion pretax gain on the sale of our it services business partially offset by 192 million of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestiture lower nondivestiturerelated unallocated corporate expense reflects a 60 million benefit from insurance settlements related to shareholder litigation involving the former orbital atk prior to the company’s acquisition that was resolved in june 2019 as well as benefits recognized during the year associated with changes in deferred state taxes partially offset by higher deferred state tax expense related to the company’s 2021 mtm benefit

net estimateatcompletion eac adjustments  we record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion net eac adjustments using the cumulative catchup method of accounting net eac adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below 

net eac adjustments by segment are presented in the table below 

for purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate respectively 

aeronautics systems 

sales 

2021 sales decreased 910 million or 7 percent due to lower volume in both manned aircraft and autonomous systems lower sales reflect a 444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer in 2020 150 million of lower f35 sales lower a350 production activity and lower volume on the b2 defensive management systems modernization dms program and certain global hawk programs 

operating income 

2021 operating income decreased 113 million or 9 percent principally due to lower sales 2021 operating margin rate decreased to 97 percent from 99 percent due to lower net favorable eac adjustments driven by f35 partially offset by improved performance on autonomous systems programs 

defense systems 

sales 

2021 sales decreased 18 billion or 23 percent primarily due to a 15 billion reduction in sales related to the it services divestiture 2021 organic sales decreased 236 million or 4 percent due to 397 million lower sales in connection with the closeout of the contract at the army’s lake city ammunition plant lake city and lower volume on an international training program partially offset by higher volume on several programs including republic of korea global hawk contractor logistics support rok global hawk cls us customs and border protection p3 cbp p3 gmlrs b2 sustainment and advanced fuzes 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating income 

2021 operating income decreased 150 million or 18 percent due to the impact of the it services divestiture operating margin rate increased to 120 percent from 112 percent and reflects improved performance at battle management and missile systems due to changes in mix as a result of recent contract completions 

mission systems 

sales 

2021 sales increased 54 million or 1 percent due to higher volume across the sector partially offset by a 485 million reduction in sales related to the it services divestiture 2021 organic sales increased 539 million or 6 percent maritimeland systems and sensors sales increased primarily due to 137 million higher volume on gator and higher marine systems volume airborne multifunction sensors sales increased principally due to 105 million higher volume on airborne radar programs including sabr and higher restricted sales partially offset by lower volume on airborne electronic warfare programs navigation targeting and survivability sales increased principally due to 124 million higher intercompany volume largely related to gbsd rampup networked information solutions sales increased principally due to higher volume on electronic warfare programs including jcrew and higher intercompany volume partially offset by lower volume on f35 cni programs 

operating income 

2021 operating income increased 120 million or 8 percent due to a higher operating margin rate and higher sales operating margin rate increased to 156 percent from 145 percent due to higher net favorable eac adjustments which reflect improved performance and the first quarter 2021 reduction in overhead rates the favorable resolution of certain government accounting matters in the second quarter of 2021 and mix changes largely related to the it services divestiture 

space systems 

sales 

2021 sales increased 19 billion or 21 percent due to higher volume in both the launch  strategic missiles and space business areas partially offset by a 166 million reduction in sales related to the it services divestiture 2021 organic sales increased 20 billion or 24 percent launch  strategic missiles sales increased primarily due to rampup on development programs including a 11 billion increase on gbsd and a 206 million increase on ngi space sales were driven by higher volume on restricted programs and increases of 192 million on artemis and 140 million on next gen opir 

operating income 

2021 operating income increased 228 million or 26 percent due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate operating margin rate increased to 106 percent from 102 percent primarily due to higher net favorable eac adjustments which were largely driven by improved performance on commercial space programs and the first quarter 2021 reduction in overhead rates 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

1 a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “segment operating results” 

product sales and costs 

2021 product sales increased 853 million or 3 percent due to rampup on development programs including gbsd and ngi at space systems as well as higher volume on airborne radar and land systems programs at mission systems the increase was partially offset by lower restricted sales and lower net favorable eac adjustments at aeronautics systems as well as closeout of the lake city contract at defense systems 

2021 product costs increased 676 million or 3 percent consistent with the higher product sales described above 

service sales and costs 

2021 service sales decreased 20 billion or 20 percent primarily due to the it services divestiture year to date 2021 sales from the it services business which were largely included in service sales were 162 million as compared to 23 billion in the prior year period the reductions associated with the it services divestiture were partially offset by higher volume on the rok global hawk cls and cbp p3 programs at defense systems 

2021 service costs decreased 18 billion or 21 percent consistent with the lower service sales described above 

backlog 

backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period it comprises both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2021 and 2020 



2021 net awards totaled 321 billion significant 2021 new awards include 61 billion for restricted programs primarily at space systems mission systems and aeronautics systems 32 billion for the sls booster production and operations contract 26 billion for ngi 22 billion for f35 10 billion for e2 and 09 billion for nasa’s halo module in connection with the it services divestiture the company reduced backlog by 14 billion during the first quarter of 2021 10 billion at defense systems 02 billion at mission systems and 02 billion at space systems 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company’s material cash requirements including working capital needs satisfaction of contractual commitments funding of our pension and opb plans investment in our business through capital expenditures and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 35 billion 295 million was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries we expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities commercial paper andor in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the sec if needed to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the shortterm and longterm the company has a fiveyear senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 20 billion and in april 2021 we renewed our oneyear 500 million uncommitted credit facility at december 31 2021 there was no balance outstanding under these credit facilities 

the company’s principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations repayments of longterm debt and related interest and payments under operating leases at december 31 2021 we had 177 billion of purchase obligations approximately half of which is shortterm purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under us government contracts in most circumstances our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our us government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts as such we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company at december 31 2021 we had capital expenditure commitments of 15 billion which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand we also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of 16 billion some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities at this time we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions 

refer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs note 3 commercial paper credit facilities and longterm debt note 10 standby letters of credit and guarantees note 12 future minimum contributions for the company’s pension and opb plans note 13 and lease payment obligations note 15 

covid19 and the cares act 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” established a program with provisions to allow us companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between march 27 2020 and december 31 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022 our first installment of deferred social security taxes of 200 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second installment of 200 million is due in the fourth quarter of 2022 under section 3610 the cares act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of covid19 the company continues to seek and anticipates continuing to seek recovery for certain covid19related costs under section 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

3610 of the cares act and through our contract provisions though it is unclear what funds will be available and how much we will be able to recover in addition the dod has to date taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts it is unclear what steps the dod will continue to take 

cash flow measures 

in addition to our cash position we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



1 includes depreciation and amortization noncash lease expense mtm benefit expense stock based compensation expense deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and opb income 

2021 cash provided by operating activities decreased 738 million principally due to federal and state taxes of 785 million paid in connection with the it services divestiture lower 2021 pension and opb contributions were largely offset by the impact of cares act social security tax deferrals and the 2020 increase in dod progress payment rates 

adjusted free cash flow 

adjusted free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities and the aftertax impact of discretionary pension contributions adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction it also includes the aftertax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance this measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions the payment of dividends and stock repurchases this nongaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with gaap 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow 



2021 adjusted free cash flow decreased 14 billion principally due to federal and state taxes of 785 million paid related to the it services divestiture as well as the impact of cares act social security tax deferrals and the 2020 increase in dod progress payment rates 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

investing cash flow 

2021 net cash provided by investing activities was 21 billion compared to net cash used in investing activities of 12 billion in the prior year principally due to 34 billion in cash received from the sale of our it services business during the first quarter of 2021 

financing cash flow 

2021 net cash used in financing activities increased 66 billion principally due to an increase of 32 billion in share repurchases and 12 billion in debt repayments 2020 net cash used in financing activities included 22 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services 

contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost since our contracts typically span a period of several years estimation of revenue cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science cost estimates on fixedprice development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in those estimates as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include changes in or resolution of identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income see “segment operating results” and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement benefits 

overview – the determination of projected benefit obligations the fair value of plan assets and pension and opb expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions ie actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 298 percent at december 31 2021 and 268 percent at december 31 2020 

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2021 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2021 pension and opb obligations which would be reflected in the 2021 mtm expense benefit and 2022 expected pension and opb expense 



cash balance crediting rate – a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the current 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate used for fas purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm expense benefit the minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 225 percent the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to the minimum threshold of 225 percent as of december 31 2021 and will remain at 225 percent through 2027 holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2021 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2021 pension benefit obligation which would be reflected in the 2021 mtm expense benefit and 2022 expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans however we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable 

during 2021 the investment committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations the current asset allocation is approximately 40 public equities 30 fixedincome 25

alternatives and 5 cash at this time the investment committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2021 was approximately 112 percent and our 20year and 30year rolling average rates of return were approximately 88 percent and 96 percent respectively each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses our 2021 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 109 percent 

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

for determining 2021 fas expense we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 75 percent and an expected longterm rate of return on opb plan assets of 722 percent for 2022 fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 75 percent and 719 percent on opb plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2021 eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2022 expected pension and opb expense 



in addition holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2022 mtm expense benefit 



estimated fair market value of plan assets – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values nav as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plans experience committee rpec issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected in october 2019 the rpec issued an updated mortality base table the private retirement plans mortality table for 2012 pri2012 which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience in october 2021 the rpec released a new projection scale mp2021 that included additional underlying data for 2019 which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year 

after considering the information released by the rpec in october 2021 as well as the company’s recent mortality experience in light of the covid19 pandemic we adopted the full mp2021 projection scale while continuing to use the pri2012 white collar table accordingly we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31 2021 and the amounts estimated for our 2022 pension and opb expense

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes enforcement actions investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect management’s assessment regarding what is 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters  – we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology as we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets current portion and other noncurrent assets until charged to contracts we use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs assessing among other things us government regulations our us government contract mix and past practices portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed 

income tax matters – the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim requires the use of judgment we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim the company follows a recognition and measurement approach considering the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position in measuring the tax position the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations our 2021 increase in unrecognized tax benefits of 149 million was primarily related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which includes related final revenue recognition regulations issued in december 2020 under irc section 451b and procedural guidance issued in august 2021

goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 

overview – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date the most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customerrelated intangible assets including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships we determine the fair value of those customerrelated intangible assets based on estimates and judgments including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates and discount rates in some cases we use discounted cash flow analyses which are based on estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance 

impairment testing – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions during 2021 we considered covid19related impacts on our business and determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

we test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group if such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount we recognize a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of 418 million at december 31 2021 these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2021 at december 31 2021 we have 128 billion of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 151 billion the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2021 foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 120 million were outstanding at december 31 2021 a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

selected financial data 

for a summary of selected consolidated financial information see “selected financial data” under part ii  item 6 

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 84 percent 83 percent and 82 percent of sales during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively for further information on sales by customer type contract type and geographic region see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal civil markets boeing company general dynamics l3harris technologies lockheed martin and raytheon technologies are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2020 total backlog which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations was 810 billion as compared with 648 billion at december 31 2019 for further information see “backlog” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

human capital

see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to our workforce and employee relations 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

we are prohibited by the us government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs these programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in 

northrop grumman corporation 

accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to unallowable employee compensation costs certain legal costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two contract types 

costtype contracts – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

fixedprice contracts – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development lowrate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and “risk factors” for further information regarding our contracts and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type 

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2020 recognized by contract type and customer category 



1 sales to the us government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the us government each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the us government 

2 international sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer these sales include foreign military sales contracted through the us government 

environmental 

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment in 2015 we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels to reduce potable water use by 

northrop grumman corporation 

20 percent from 2014 levels and to achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate away from landfills we are currently measuring our performance to those goals and are in the process of developing new environmental sustainability goals for 2021 and beyond 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments see “risk factors” and notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

industry and economic risks 

▪ we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for a substantial portion of our business changes in this customer’s priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 84 percent of our sales in 2020 we have a number of large programs with the us department of the air force in particular the us government has been implementing significant changes and spending levels have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time even more so we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in the threat environment defense spending levels government priorities political leadership procurement strategy military strategy and planning or broader changes in social economic or political demands and priorities the us government also has the ability to delay modify or cancel ongoing competitions procurements and programs as well as to change its future acquisition strategy 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

northrop grumman corporation 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination of a contract or contracts for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities programs or acquisition strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and us government funding more broadly may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract more broadly we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations ultimately approved by congress and the president or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract for such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

the us continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years 

in august 2019 the bipartisan budget act of 2019 was enacted increasing spending caps under the budget control act bca for fy 2020 and fy 2021 the final two fiscal years covered by the bca and suspending the debt ceiling through july 31 2021 in february 2020 the then president proposed a budget request for fy 2021 which addressed various capabilities highlighted in the us national security strategy the national defense strategy and the missile defense review on december 27 2020 fy 2021 appropriations were enacted under the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 

the budget environment and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes and the debt ceiling remain significant short and longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the new administration and congress and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets and we may face a government shutdown of unknown duration if a prolonged government shutdown of the dod were to occur it could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders and could limit the us government’s ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments and our ability to perform on our us government contracts and successfully compete for new work 

we believe continued budget pressures could have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment could have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

northrop grumman corporation 

funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod and other customers have previously indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending changing priorities budget pressures defense spending cuts challenges in the appropriations process the debt ceiling and ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our current and future programs longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ we use estimates when accounting for contracts contract cost growth or changes in estimated contract revenues and costs could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase reasons for increased estimated contract costs may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs and aim to protect against these risks through contract terms and conditions when practical 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than costtype contracts in 2020 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss 

our fixedprice contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in adjustments to those estimates 

under costtype contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise we also may face additional financial risk due to an increasing number of contract solicitations requiring the contractor to bid on costtype development work and related fixedprice production lots andor options in one submission or costtype development work requiring the contractor to provide certain items to the customer at the contractor’s expense or at little or no fee 

because of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more 

northrop grumman corporation 

of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

▪ competition within our markets and bid protests may affect our ability to win new contracts and result in reduced revenues and market share 

we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms including new entrants in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer additionally some customers including the dod are turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services and may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we are also seeing a significant number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests can result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

▪ we are subject to various investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation arbitration and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us 

the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions prosecutions litigation and other legal proceedings particularly those involving governments including federal state and outside the us which may be increasingly aggressive we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions and administrative civil or criminal litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts commercial transactions false claims false statements antitrust compliance with government orders mischarging contract performance fraud procurement integrity products liability warranty liability the use of hazardous materials personal injury claims environmental shareholder derivative actions prior acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property tax employees exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety the covid19 pandemic and the company’s response to it accidents launch failures and employee benefits and plans including plan administration improper payments and issues related to privacy and security cyber and physical as well as matters relating to the orbital atk federal trade commission decision and order these matters could divert financial and management resources result in administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions which terms include judgments or convictions and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements compensatory treble or other damages nonmonetary relief or actions or other liabilities and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards government regulations provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of exportimport privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute enforcement action or litigation even if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business obtain and retain awards or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our reputation our ability to do business and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or joint ventures in which we participate 

northrop grumman corporation 

we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information false claims procurement integrity cost accounting and billing competition information security and data privacy or the terms of our contracts however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct despite a vigorous compliance program this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally with greater opportunities and demands to do more business with local and new partners at the same time law enforcement agencies are continuing to focus on combating global corruption in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures with that term used throughout to refer to joint efforts or business arrangements of any type notwithstanding our robust process we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business including our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners and joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties liabilities and the loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ as a us government contractor we and our partners are subject to various procurement and other laws regulations and contract terms applicable to our industry and we could be adversely affected by changes in such laws regulations and terms or any negative findings by the us government as to our compliance with them we also may be adversely affected by changes in our customers’ business practices globally 

us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although often customary in government contracting increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity and related certification requirements for our company and our partners privacy information protection cost accounting recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts pensions antihuman trafficking specialty metals conflict minerals and use of certain nonus equipment can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and accounting and our compliance with applicable laws regulations terms and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact regardless of the ultimate outcome in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us or our business partners 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally largely as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to government accounting matters and business systems for current and past years as well as a lengthened period of time required to close open audits an increased number of broad requests for information and an increased risk of withholding of payments for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs including certain costs related to environmental remediation and pensions and certain assumptions used by the company to determine pension expense are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract 

northrop grumman corporation 

provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be among others also may affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal state and local laws regulations contract terms and requirements related to our industry our products and the businesses we operate these laws and regulations include but are not limited to the truthful cost or pricing data act false claims act procurement integrity act federal communications commission act cas far international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act export administration regulations promulgated under the export control reform act close the contractor fraud loophole act and fcpa as well as orders rules and regulations administered by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and those related to pandemics if we are found to have violated any such requirements or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of exportimport privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ environmental matters including unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts and government and third party claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed or enforced differently over time compliance with these environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including suspension and debarment for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages a determination that certain remediation or other environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated we also incur and expect to continue to incur additional costs to meet environmental sustainability goals increasingly required by our stakeholders 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including individual and class actions and water districts relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages fines penalties and nonmonetary relief and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage 

we are engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation and other costs and liabilities related to environmental conditions in bethpage applicable remediation standards and other requirements to which we are subject may continue to change our costs may increase materially and those costs may not be fully recoverable we have reached a tentative agreement with the state of new york regarding the steps we will take to implement the state’s amended record of decision and to resolve certain other potential claims including for natural resource damages the state is preparing to file a new consent decree reflecting the agreement and to seek court approval in addition we are a party to various and expect to become a party to additional legal proceedings and disputes related to remediation environmental impacts costs and the allowability of costs we incur including with federal and state entities 

northrop grumman corporation 

including the united states navy the defense contract management agency the state local municipalities and water districts and insurance carriers as well as class action and individual plaintiffs alleging personal injury and property damage and seeking both monetary and nonmonetary relief these bethpage matters could result in additional costs fines penalties sanctions compensatory or other damages determinations on allowability allocation and insurance coverage and nonmonetary relief 

in addition government and private parties could seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which we believe other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us federal state and local or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability as they did in 2017 upon passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition the final determination of any state or federal tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as a result of the acquisition of orbital atk inc oatk in 2018 we are subject to outstanding tax audits and may be subject to future tax audits and legal challenges involving oatk and its subsidiaries the spinoff of its then subsidiary vista outdoor inc vista in 2015 and related matters oatk has a tax matters agreement with vista pursuant to which in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations vista is required to indemnify oatk against taxes on the spinoff however there are circumstances pursuant to which we may be unable to obtain an indemnification payment or we may be required to indemnify vista for such taxes under the tax matters agreement 

changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations the interpretation or application thereof or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

business and operational risks 

▪ we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks which may have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” since first reported in late 2019 the covid19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases business slowdowns or shutdowns government challenges and market volatility of an unprecedented nature although we have to date managed to continue most of our operations we cannot predict the future course of events nor can we assure that this global pandemic including its economic impact will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows for further information relating to our company’s experience to date and various steps taken related to the risks presented by the covid19 pandemic see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be further impacted by the covid19 pandemic if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines or absenteeism steps the company has taken to protect health and wellbeing government actions facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages inadequate supplies or resources such as reliable personal protective equipment testing and vaccines or other circumstances related to covid19 looking forward we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts we may experience interruptions in our business and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result we will continue to incur additional costs as a result of the covid19 outbreak including to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and as a result of impacts on operations and performance which costs we may not be fully able to recover we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements enforcement actions and litigation again with costs and liabilities that are not fully recoverable or insured the continued spread of covid19 may also affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and to maintain our corporate culture 

the continued global pandemic including the economic impact are likely also to cause further disruption in our supply chain if our suppliers have increased challenges with their workforce including as a result of illness 

northrop grumman corporation 

absenteeism or government orders facility closures access to necessary components and supplies access to capital and access to fundamental support services such as shipping and transportation they may be unable to provide the agreedupon goods and services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner we may incur additional costs and delays in our business including as a result of higher prices schedule delays or the need to identify and develop alternative suppliers and we may need to provide additional resources to support our suppliers or otherwise continue performance under our contracts in some instances we may be unable to do that incurring additional liabilities under our current contracts and hampering new ones 

the global covid19 crisis is putting extraordinary pressures on the us government and governments around the world it could cause delays or limits in the ability of the government and other customers to perform including making timely payments and awards to us negotiating contracts and agreeing appropriate costs for recovery performing quality inspections supporting testing accepting delivery approving security clearances for individuals and facilities and providing necessary personnel equipment and facilities in addition as a result of the covid19 crisis there may be changes in our customers’ priorities and practices as our customers in both the us and globally confront competing budget priorities and limited resources these changes may impact current and future programs customer priorities government payments and other practices procurements and funding decisions 

while we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed and uncommitted credit lines a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect both our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives additionally there can be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades and such downgrades could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets the current market volatility may also impact investment performance and our expected asset valuations and returns which could materially impact the calculation of longterm liabilities such as our pension obligations 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers and local communities in an effort to address responsibly this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our employees business supply chain and customers and to take certain actions in an effort to mitigate various adverse consequences 

we expect that the longer the covid19 pandemic including its economic disruption continues the greater the adverse impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations could be given the tremendous uncertainties and variables we cannot at this time predict the impact of the global covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic but any one could have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our international business exposes us to additional risks including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors laws and regulations 

sales to customers outside the us are an important component of our strategy our international business including our participation in joint ventures and other joint business arrangements requirements for local content and our global supply chain is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if and as our international business continues to grow 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation laws and regulations relating to exportimport controls sanctions technology transfer restrictions government contracts and procurement data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export control reform act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups antihuman trafficking taxes environment immunity security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative civil commercial or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our exportimport privileges our customers outside of the us generally have the ability to terminate contracts for default based on performance suspension or debarment or termination of a contract due to default in particular could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally despite robust processes we also face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products 

northrop grumman corporation 

changes in laws regulations political leadership and environment political relations and instability andor security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets including sales to customers outside the us and purchases from suppliers outside the us our international business may be impacted by changes in us and foreign national policies and priorities and geopolitical relationships any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment political leadership geopolitical uncertainties world events bilateral and multilateral relationships government budgets and economic and political factors more generally and any of which could impact funding for programs our ability to perform andor export authorizations or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business for example the tightening of credit in financial markets outside of the us could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments 

our contracts with nonus customers may also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other operational or financial obligations including offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements they may also require us to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees andor other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations we also are dependent on incountry suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts and applicable laws particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis we face risks related to our products that are approved for export but may be subject to the us government changing or revoking the export authorization after the product is ordered our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business more broadly our ability effectively to pursue and execute contracts outside the us also may be impacted by our ability to partner successfully with nonus companies including through joint ventures teaming agreements coproduction or other arrangements in support of such pursuits this risk includes the ability to timely identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with local partners as well as potential exposure for their actions this risk may increase depending on local requirements regarding who we partner with and under what circumstances particularly where we are effectively required to partner with governmentaffiliated entities 

the products and services we provide including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees subcontractors or other third parties andor increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions 

as a defense contractor we face significant cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to and to harm sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security and viability of our facilities infrastructure products and supply chain and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including our supply chain and joint ventures often face similar threats and growing requirements including ones for which others may seek to hold us responsible although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities theft of data harm to personnel infrastructure or products financial liabilities and the misuse of our products as well as damage to our reputation as a government contractor and provider of cyberrelated or cyberprotected goods and services 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners corruption of data networks or 

northrop grumman corporation 

systems harm to individuals and loss of assets in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these various factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business contractual or regulatory actions and potential liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our earnings and profitability depend in part on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials chemicals and components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property provide information about the parts they supply to us and perform some of the services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers failure to meet regulatory or contractual requirements or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have various impacts on the company including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products materials or information or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract or applicable regulations changes in political or economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or sanctions or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier including changes in ownership or operations as well as their ability to retain talent and other resources and requirements or changes in requirements imposed on them by other customers could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform or their inability to perform adequately could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers this risk may increase as the demands grow for our subcontractors and suppliers to meet extensive governmentrelated cyber and other requirements 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer among many other examples we require assured access to microelectronics we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements both domestically and internationally many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers as a prime we are often responsible for not only our compliance with these regulatory requirements but that of our subcontractors and suppliers too in some cases there may be only one supplier or one domestic supplier for certain components if a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and contract terms including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws and regulations including cybersecurity and related certification requirements 

if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in deliveries of needed products materials or services or if they do not comply with all applicable laws regulations 

northrop grumman corporation 

requirements and contract terms including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper our financial position results of operations andor cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

▪ our ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends in part on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 

our operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math and who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture outside the us it is increasingly important that we are also able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience we are facing competition for talent both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies if qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees there is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity equity and inclusion objectives or more broadly to meet sustainability goals increasingly required by our shareholders employees and other stakeholders 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages slowdowns or other laborrelated disruptions any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected 

▪ many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require stateoftheart manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet our contractual obligations could adversely affect our profitability reputation and future prospects 

we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments including some under highly demanding operating conditions to accomplish challenging missions problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology research and development funding intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components or subcontractor performance could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations could negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement unintended explosions or similar events problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials inadequate delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received or replacement obligations 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that also entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material 

northrop grumman corporation 

adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

we have significant operations including centers of excellence located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes other damaging storms water levels wildfires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters the nature frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change and delays in recovery may be significant 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations which subjects us to various environmental regulatory financial reputational and other risks 

we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services we use and provide energetic materials and solid rocket motors including products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements we develop missile systems and counter systems including strategic deterrents as well as subsystems and components all of these activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including 1 potential liabilities relating to nuclear or launchrelated incidents unintended initiation of energetic materials and explosions including risk of personal injury property damage and environmental harm 2 to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and 3 to failed launches we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear launch or explosive incident among others whether or not the cause was within our control and insurance may not be available under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 10 usc 2354 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks but those protections may not be available and they are limited in scope 

certain of our products such as small medium and large caliber ammunition and solid rocket motors and liquid propulsion engines involve the use manufacture andor handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials from time to time these activities have resulted in incidents that have caused workplace injuries and fatalities the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing processes production delays environmental harm and expense fines and liability to third parties we have safety and loss prevention programs which provide for preconstruction reviews of process changes and new operations along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials to attempt to mitigate such incidents as well as insurance coverage we and our customers may experience similar or more serious incidents in the future which could result in various liabilities and production delays 

in addition our customers may use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky or in ways that are not intended creating potential liabilities for our company as the provider of the products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or as intended or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities an incident related to the use of energetics or rocket motors or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available to cover our losses and liabilities it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

northrop grumman corporation 

▪ we may be unable fully to exploit or adequately to protect intellectual property rights which could materially affect our ability to compete our reputation and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms we may not be able adequately to exploit protect or access intellectual property and the conduct of our customers competitors and suppliers may make it more difficult for us to do so 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and may seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they have or should have the right to do so governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could reduce our ability to develop protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants teammates and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts may require us to access and use third party intellectual property this may require that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and new technologies and maintain technologies facilities and equipment to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers 

many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally in addition our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends in part on continued funding for and investment in research and development projects our success also depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency our customers and markets also increasingly require us to be agile and efficient and digitally enabled if we are unable to develop new products and technologies in a timely fashion or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

northrop grumman corporation 

general and other risk factors 

▪ our insurance coverage customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of or be unable to pay for material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position 

we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid responsible highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters space launches hazardous operations energetics and products liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are or should be insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be available or sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred including claims related to pandemics and communicable disease even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us or without increasing exclusions disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the availability or timing of recovery and may impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available can be difficult to obtain are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ pension and other postretirement benefit opb obligations and related expenses recorded in our financial statements may fluctuate significantly depending upon investment performance of plan assets changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions 

a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and opb plans defined benefit pension and opb obligations and related expenses as recorded in our financial statements are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums for certain of our defined benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and minimum required contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

investment performance of plan assets changes in assumptions associated with our pension and opb plans and government challenges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

▪ changes in future business conditions could cause business investments andor recorded goodwill and other longlived assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

goodwill accounts for approximately 39 percent of our total assets although we currently have excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions additionally we acquired a significant amount of purchased intangible and other longlived assets in the merger whose recovery is dependent in part on future business conditions we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations

acquisition of orbital atk 

on june 6 2018 the “merger date” the company completed its previously announced acquisition of orbital atk inc “orbital atk” the “merger” on the merger date orbital atk became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to northrop grumman innovation systems inc we established innovation systems as a new fourth business sector the operating results of legacy innovation systems subsequent to the merger date have been included in the company’s consolidated results of operations and upon our january 1 2020 sector realignment are reflected in the space systems defense systems and aeronautics systems sectors see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of orbital atk 

in june 2018 the us federal trade commission ftc issued a decision and order enabling the acquisition to proceed and providing for solid rocket motors to be available on a nondiscriminatory basis under certain circumstances and processes the company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the order similarly the compliance officer appointed under the order and the ftc have taken and continue to take various actions to oversee compliance in october 2019 the company received a civil investigative demand from the ftc requesting certain information relating to a potential issue of the company’s compliance with the order in connection with a then pending strategic missile competition the company has provided information in response to the request we believe the company has been and continues to be in full compliance with the order but we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 

disposition of it and mission support services business 

on december 7 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our it and mission support services business for 34 billion in cash the it and mission support services business is comprised of the majority of the information solutions and services iss division of defense systems excluding our vinnell arabia business select cyber intelligence and missions support programs which are part of the cyber and intelligence mission solutions cims division of mission systems and the space technical services business unit of space systems the assets and liabilities of the it and mission support services business were classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position as of december 31 2020 and no impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income for the year ended december 31 2020 we expect to complete the sale of the it and mission support services business in the first quarter of 2021 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the disposition 

covid19 

coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” was first reported in late 2019 and has since dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases business slowdowns or shutdowns government challenges and market volatility in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a global pandemic and the president declared a national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak the company’s leadership our crisis management and business resumption teams and local site leadership continue closely to monitor and address the developments including the impact on our company our employees our customers our suppliers and our communities the company has considered and continues to consider guidance from the centers for disease control cdc other health organizations federal state and local governmental authorities and our customers among others we have taken and continue to take robust actions to help protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees to support our suppliers and local communities and to continue to serve our customers our goals have been to lessen the immediate potential adverse impacts both health and economic and to continue to position the company for longterm success like the communities in which we serve our actions have varied depending on the spread of covid19 and local health requirements the needs of our employees and the needs of our business among other actions we have required or enabled employees to work from home or remotely where practicable and expanded it and communication support to enhance their productivity adjusted work spaces and shift schedules to facilitate social distancing for those who continue to work in our facilities enhanced cleaning and disinfecting procedures at our facilities required face coverings and worked 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

to procure and distribute personal protective equipment ppe implemented health checks and visitor protocols restricted travel provided additional benefits to our employees including for those most at risk and contributed financial and manufacturing resources to supporting critical national requirements such as for ppe along with the northrop grumman foundation we have provided grants for global national and local organizations that support frontline healthcare workers address food insecurity advance efforts for vaccines increase student access to technology and provide support to vulnerable populations donated ppe items to emergency response teams and healthcare professionals including n95 masks and tyvek suits and established a covid19 relief matching gift program for employees more recently we have sought to assist state and local governments as they start to distribute and deliver vaccines 

earlier in the covid19 pandemic and at times of higher transmission many state and local jurisdictions implemented mandatory stayathome or shelterinplace orders most of those orders exempted some or all of the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and many of our suppliers as part of the essential or critical infrastructure our facilities have largely remained open and many of our employees who cannot work remotely are continuing to come to work and support our customers’ national security and missionessential operations towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 some state and local jurisdictions started to lift mandatory stayathome or shelterinplace orders and started gradually to ease restrictions we started to implement or prepared to implement certain return to office plans to allow some employees who had been working remotely gradually to return to the workplace later in 2020 as the number of cases began to rise again and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2020 we paused or reversed many of our efforts to bring more employees back to the work place in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 after fda approval we began to explore how the company could best facilitate the provision of vaccinations to our personnel in accordance with federal guidance and state and local vaccination plans absenteeism rates including because of employees in quarantine or those suffering from covid19 and the impacts on productivity have fluctuated significantly especially as local cases and transmission rates have changed throughout we have worked to adapt and to take robust actions to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and to serve our customers considering among other things local circumstances state and local requirements and guidance from the cdc we have also taken various steps in efforts to support our suppliers with a particular focus on critical small and midsized business partners including passing through increased progress payments from dod to our suppliers and accelerating payments to certain suppliers 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience various increased costs to maintain our operations including as a result of actions taken to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees because of illness quarantines and absenteeism as a result of government actions and because of disruption and stress among our suppliers and customers we have also experienced certain lower costs including those related to employee travel some health benefits and personal time off we continue to monitor this situation closely and cannot predict how it will change including the extent of any increase in the number of covid19 cases and the costs and impacts to us our customers have generally continued to make timely payments and we are working with them to consider the possibility of additional cost recoveries again however our customers are facing tremendous demands and budget pressures and we cannot predict how this may change and how they will continue to allocate limited resources 

the company’s overall 2020 revenue and operating income were not significantly impacted by covid19 however our employees suppliers and customers the company and our global community are facing tremendous challenges and we cannot predict how this dynamic situation will evolve or the impact it will have on the company for further information on the potential impact to the company of covid19 see “risk factors” 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions diverse regional security concerns and political instability global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

the global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2021 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility and the covid19 pandemic the global economy may also be affected by britain’s exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time additionally economic tensions and changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements could impact the global market for defense products services and solutions 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

us political and economic environment 

the us continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years 

in august 2019 the bipartisan budget act of 2019 was enacted increasing spending caps under the budget control act bca for fy 2020 and fy 2021 the final two fiscal years covered by the bca and suspending the debt ceiling through july 31 2021 in february 2020 the then president proposed a budget request for fy 2021 which addressed various capabilities highlighted in the us national security strategy the national defense strategy and the missile defense review on december 27 2020 fy 2021 appropriations were enacted under the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 in 2020 congress also passed several emergency covid19 relief bills addressing certain impacts of the pandemic it is continuing to consider other responses to the covid19 crisis with broader implications for the defense industry and the overall economic environment including the national debt with a new president and administration a new congress and pressing debt and needs it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets however the threat remains very substantial and we believe that our capabilities particularly in space missiles missile defense hypersonics counterhypersonics survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers to meet the threats and as a result continue to allow for longterm profitable growth in our business 

the political environment federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular 

for further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment see “risk factors” 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically larger contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts as control is transferred to the customer primarily over time on a costtocost basis cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor subcontractor material overhead and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance andor contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels and performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type andor life cycle eg costtype fixedprice development production andor sustainment 

consolidated operating results 

for purposes of the operating results discussion below we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures exclude marktomarket pension and opb “mtm” expense and related tax impacts and are described as mtmadjusted net earnings and mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the nonoperational impact of pension and opb actuarial gains and losses these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of mtm accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards we reconcile these nongaap

financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below these nongaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

2020 sales increased 30 billion or 9 percent due to higher sales at all four sectors 

see “segment operating results” below for further information by segment and “product and service analysis” for product and service detail see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type contract type and geographic region for each of our segments 

operating income and margin rate 

2020 operating income increased 96 million or 2 percent primarily due to an increase in segment operating income partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expense and a lower net fas servicecas pension adjustment 2020 operating margin rate declined to 110 percent from 117 percent principally due to a lower segment operating margin rate higher unallocated corporate expense and lower net fas servicecas pension adjustment 

2020 ga costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 93 percent from 97 percent primarily due to higher sales volume partially offset by higher independent research and development costs 

for further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses see “product and service analysis” below 

marktomarket pension and opb expense 

the primary components of pretax mtm expense are presented in the table below 



2020 mtm expense of 10 billion was primarily driven by a 71 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2019 partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 162 percent compared to our 80 percent asset return assumption 

federal and foreign income taxes 

the 2020 effective tax rate increased to 145 percent from 118 percent in 2019 mtm expense reduced the 2020 effective tax rate by 13 percentage points and the 2019 effective tax rate by 37 percentage points see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

net earnings 

the table below reconciles net earnings to mtmadjusted net earnings 



1 mtm expense is expected to be deductible on our future state tax returns the deferred state tax benefit was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 525 percent in 2020 and 450 percent in 2019 and 2018 and included in unallocated corporate expense within operating income 

2 mtm expense is expected to be deductible on our future federal tax returns the federal tax benefit in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax benefit from mtm expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate 

net earnings increased 941 million or 42 percent in 2020 principally due to a 584 million decrease in our mtm expense net of tax excluding this impact mtmadjusted net earnings increased by 357 million or 10 percent primarily due to increases in our fas nonservice benefit and operating income partially offset by higher income tax and interest expense 

diluted earnings per share 

the table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share 



1 mtm expense is expected to be deductible on our future state tax returns the deferred state tax benefit was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 525 percent in 2020 and 450 percent in 2019 and 2018 and included in unallocated corporate expense within operating income 

2 mtm expense is expected to be deductible on our future federal tax returns the federal tax benefit in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax benefit from mtm expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate 

diluted earnings per share increased 581 or 44 percent principally due to a 337 increase associated with lower mtm expense net of tax excluding this impact mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share increased 244 or 12 percent reflecting a 10 percent increase in mtmadjusted net earnings and a 1 percent decrease in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

effective january 1 2020 the company reorganized its sectors to better align the company’s broad portfolio to serve its customers’ needs at december 31 2020 the company was aligned in four operating sectors which also comprise our reportable segments aeronautics systems defense systems mission systems and space systems the segment operating results below include sales and operating income for legacy innovation systems subsequent to the merger date for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see “business” 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 the company no longer considers certain unallowable costs as part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance as a result certain unallowable costs which were previously included in segment operating results are now reported in unallocated corporate expense within 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating income this change has been applied retrospectively in the accompanying financial information see part ii item 5 in the quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2020 for further information regarding the impact of this change on the company’s prior period segment information 

we present our sectors in the following business areas which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities 

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below 

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the table below and segment operating margin rate segment operating income divided by sales are nongaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america measures that reflect total earnings from our four segments including allocated pension expense we have recognized under far and cas and excluding fas pension expense and unallocated corporate items certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or far and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors these measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 



1 represents the deferred state tax benefit associated with mtm expense which is recorded in unallocated corporate expense consistent with other changes in deferred state taxes 

segment operating income and margin rate 

2020 segment operating income increased 210 million or 5 percent and reflects higher operating income at all four sectors segment operating margin rate decreased to 114 percent from 118 percent principally due to a lower operating margin rate at aeronautics systems 

net fas servicecas pension adjustment 

the decrease in our 2020 net fas servicecas pension adjustment is primarily due to higher fas service pension expense largely as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2019 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

unallocated corporate expense 

the increase in 2020 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to the absence in 2020 of an 89 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of a cost accounting litigation matter and 60 million of higher state tax expense in the current year state tax expense increased principally due to changes in deferred state income taxes including a lower mtmrelated deferred state tax benefit and an increase in reserves in part for potential unallowable costs associated with state apportionment these increases were partially offset by 68 million of lower intangible asset amortization and ppe stepup depreciation 

net estimateatcompletion eac adjustments  we record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion net eac adjustments using the cumulative catchup method of accounting net eac adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below 

net eac adjustments by segment are presented in the table below 

1 amounts reflect eac adjustments after the percent complete on legacy innovation systems contracts was reset to zero as of the merger date 

for purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate respectively 

aeronautics systems 

sales 

2020 sales increased 11 billion or 9 percent due to higher sales in both manned aircraft and autonomous systems higher volume on restricted programs including a 444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer e2d and triton were partially offset by lower volume on the b2 defensive management system modernization program as it nears completion see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the sale of equipment described above 

operating income 

2020 operating income increased 18 million or 2 percent due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate 2020 operating margin rate decreased to 99 percent from 107 percent principally due to lower net eac adjustments as well as the sale of equipment to a restricted customer which was dilutive to the overall sector margin rate 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

defense systems 

sales 

2020 sales increased 48 million or 1 percent due to higher volume in both business areas battle management  missile systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the guided missile launch rocket system gmlrs the advanced antiradiation guided missile aargm the counterrocket artillery and mortar program and other missile products partially offset by lower volume on programs nearing completion including an international weapons program and the closeout of our contract at the army’s lake city ammunition plant mission readiness sales increased principally due to higher volume on restricted and international programs partially offset by lower volume on the hunter sustainment program as it nears completion 

operating income 

2020 operating income increased 53 million or 7 percent primarily due to a higher operating margin rate operating margin increased to 112 percent from 106 percent principally due to improved performance at battle management  missile systems and mission readiness 

mission systems 

sales 

2020 sales increased 670 million or 7 percent due to higher volume across all four business areas airborne sensors  networks sales increased principally due to higher airborne radar volume including the f35 multirole electronically scanned array mesa and scalable agile beam radar sabr programs and higher restricted volume navigation targeting  survivability sales increased primarily due to higher volume on selfprotection avionics and targeting programs including litening partially offset by lower volume on infrared countermeasures programs maritimeland systems  sensors sales increased primarily due to higher volume on marine systems and restricted programs partially offset by lower international commercial volume due in part to covid19related impacts cyber  intelligence mission solutions sales increased principally due to higher restricted volume partially offset by lower volume on an intelligence program as it nears completion 

operating income 

2020 operating income increased 51 million or 4 percent due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate operating margin rate decreased to 145 percent from 150 percent primarily due to lower margin rates at maritimeland systems  sensors including covid19related impacts on certain international commercial businesses 

space systems 

sales 

2020 sales increased 13 billion or 18 percent due to higher sales in both space and launch  strategic missiles space sales were driven by higher volume on restricted programs and the next generation overhead persistent infrared and nasa artemis programs launch  strategic missiles sales increased due to rampup on the ground 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

based strategic deterrent program and higher volume on launch vehicles and hypersonics programs partially offset by lower volume on the groundbased midcourse defense program 

operating income 

2020 operating income increased 99 million or 12 percent due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate operating margin rate decreased to 102 percent from 107 percent principally due to lower net eac adjustments and changes in contract mix 

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

1 a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “segment operating results” 

product sales and costs 

2020 product sales increased 32 billion or 13 percent due to higher product sales at all four sectors including restricted programs and e2d at aeronautics systems restricted programs next gen opir and gbsd at space systems restricted f35 and airborne radar programs at mission systems and aargm gmlrs and other missile products at defense systems 

2020 product costs increased 29 billion or 14 percent consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflects lower product margins at mission systems and aeronautics systems 

service sales and costs 

2020 service sales decreased 205 million or 2 percent primarily due to lower service sales at defense systems principally due to lower volume on the hunter sustainment program and a shift toward more product content in the lifecycle of certain programs 

2020 service costs decreased 174 million or 2 percent consistent with the lower service sales described above 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

backlog 

backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period it comprises both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2020 and 2019 



2020 net awards totaled 529 billion significant 2020 new awards include 174 billion for restricted programs 90 billion at space systems 60 billion at aeronautics systems and 22 billion at mission systems 133 billion for the ground based strategic deterrent emd program 19 billion for next gen opir 17 billion for f35 09 billion for triton 09 billion for e2d and 08 billion for global hawk 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 49 billion approximately 276 million was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries in march 2020 we issued 225 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes including debt repayment and working capital to help preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic in april 2020 we entered into a oneyear 500 million uncommitted credit facility to provide an additional source of potential financing on october 15 2020 the company repaid 10 billion of unsecured senior notes upon maturity 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” established a program with provisions to allow us companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between march 27 2020 and december 31 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022 under section 3610 the cares act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of covid19 the company has begun to seek and anticipates continuing to seek recovery for certain covid19related costs under section 3610 of the cares act and through our contract provisions in addition the us department of defense dod has taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts while it is unclear how much we will be able to recover in particular under section 3610 we believe these actions should continue to mitigate some potential covid19related negative impacts to our operating cash flows in 2021 

cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities commercial paper andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months capital expenditure commitments were 13 billion at december 31 2020 and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



1 includes depreciation and amortization mtm expense stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes 

2020 cash provided by operating activities was comparable to the prior period and reflects higher net earnings and improved trade working capital as well as a 750 million discretionary pretax pension contribution 593 million aftertax as compared to a 120 million discretionary pretax pension contribution 95 million aftertax in the prior year period 

adjusted free cash flow 

adjusted free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer not otherwise included in net cash provided by operating activities and the aftertax impact of discretionary pension contributions adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction it also includes the aftertax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance this measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions the payment of dividends and share repurchases this nongaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with gaap 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow 



2020 adjusted free cash flow increased 555 million principally driven by higher net earnings and improved trade working capital as well as 205 million in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer partially offset by higher capital expenditures 

investing cash flow 

2020 net cash used in investing activities was comparable to the prior period and reflects higher capital expenditures as well as 205 million in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer 

financing cash flow 

2020 net cash used in financing activities decreased to 432 million from 24 billion principally due to 22 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2020

commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes – see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements – see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

other sources of capital – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2020 we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest make payments under operating leases settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities payments due under these obligations and commitments and the estimated timing of those payments are as follows 



1 a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts 

2 other longterm liabilities including their current portions primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves deferred compensation and other miscellaneous liabilities it excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of 15 billion as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to such positions 

the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and opb plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 10 and 15 respectively to the consolidated financial statements

our consolidated financial statements are based on gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services 

contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost since our contracts typically span a period of several years estimation of revenue cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science cost estimates on fixedprice development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in those estimates as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include changes in or resolution of identified opportunities for operating margin improvement

retirement benefits 

overview – the determination of projected benefit obligations the fair value of plan assets and pension and opb expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions ie actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 268 percent at december 31 2020 and 339 percent at december 31 2019 

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2020 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2020 pension and opb obligations which would be reflected in the 2020 mtm expense benefit and 2021 expected pension and opb expense 



northrop grumman corporation 

  

cash balance crediting rate – a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the current 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate used for fas purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm expense benefit the minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 225 percent the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to the minimum threshold of 225 percent as of december 31 2020 and will remain at 225 percent through 2026 holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2020 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2020 pension benefit obligation which would be reflected in the 2020 mtm expense benefit and 2021 expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans however we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable 

during 2020 the investment committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations the current asset allocation is approximately 40 public equities 35 fixedincome 20 alternatives and 5 cash at this time the investment committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2020 was approximately 112 percent and our 20year and 30year rolling average rates of return were approximately 80 percent and 102 percent respectively each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses our 2020 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 162 percent 

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

for determining 2020 fas expense we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent and an expected longterm rate of return on opb plan assets of 766 percent for 2021 fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 75 percent and 722 percent on opb plans we decreased the eroa assumption following an assessment of the historical and anticipated longterm returns of various asset classes including consideration of recent federal reserve policy changes that are expected to extend the duration of the current low interest rate environment holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2020 eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2021 expected pension and opb expense 



northrop grumman corporation 

  

in addition holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2021 mtm expense benefit 



estimated fair market value of plan assets – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plans experience committee rpec issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected in october 2019 the rpec issued an updated mortality base table the private retirement plans mortality table for 2012 pri2012 which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience in october 2020 the rpec released a new projection scale mp2020 that included a reshaping of the longterm mortality improvement assumption the mp2020 projection scale includes longterm mortality improvement assumptions greater than 10 at earlier ages but trends down more rapidly than the prior projection scales after considering the information released by the rpec in october 2020 we adopted the full mp2020 projection scale while continuing to use the pri2012 white collar table accordingly we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31 2020 and the amounts estimated for our 2021 pension and opb expense

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes enforcement actions investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters  – we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology as we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets current portion and other noncurrent assets until charged to contracts we use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs assessing among other things us government regulations our us government contract mix and past practices portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed 

income tax matters – the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim requires the use of judgment we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim the company follows a recognition and measurement approach considering the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position in measuring the tax position the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations during 2020 we increased our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 346 million primarily related to state apportionment our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 tax act 

for further information on litigation commitments and contingencies see “risk factors” and note 1 note 7 note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 

overview – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date the most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customerrelated intangible assets including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships we determine the fair value of those customerrelated intangible assets based on estimates and judgments including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates and discount rates in some cases we use discounted cash flow analyses which are based on estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance 

impairment testing – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions during 2020 we considered covid19related impacts on our business and determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

we test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group if such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount we recognize a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of 396 million at december 31 2020 these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2020 at december 31 2020 we have 150 billion of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 182 billion the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2020 foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 133 million were outstanding at december 31 2020 a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

selected financial data 

for a summary of selected consolidated financial information see “selected financial data” under part ii  item 6 

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 83 percent  82 percent and 85 percent of sales during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively for further information on sales by customer type contract type and geographic region see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal civil markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton general dynamics l3harris technologies leidos leonardo lockheed martin raytheon and thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2019  total backlog which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations was 648 billion as compared with 535 billion at december 31 2018  for further information see “backlog” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our approximately 90000 employees approximately 5000 are covered by 17 collective agreements in the us of which we negotiated two renewals and one new agreement in 2019 and expect to negotiate six renewals in 2020  see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to employee relations 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

we are prohibited by the us government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs these programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two contract types 

costtype contracts – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

fixedprice contracts – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development lowrate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance

 item 1a  risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 83 percent of our sales in 2019  we have a number of large programs with the us air force in particular the us government has been implementing significant changes and spending levels have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels the threat environment procurement strategy military strategy and planning andor changes in social economic or political priorities the us government also has the ability to delay modify or cancel ongoing competitions procurements and programs as well as to change its acquisition strategy 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination of a contract or contracts for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities programs or acquisition strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations ultimately approved by congress and the president or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

the us continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years 

 7  

northrop grumman corporation 

in 2019 the president proposed an fy 2020 budget requesting 750 billion for national security the president’s budget request addresses various capabilities highlighted in the us national security strategy the national defense strategy and the missile defense review on august 2 2019 the bipartisan budget act of 2019 was enacted increasing spending caps under the budget control act bca for fy 2020 and fy 2021 the final two fiscal years covered by the bca and suspending the debt ceiling through july 31 2021 on december 20 2019 fy 2020 appropriations for all federal agencies were enacted representing a 3 percent increase from fy 2019 

the budget environment and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes and the debt ceiling remain significant short and longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the administration and congress and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets and we may face another government shutdown of unknown duration if a prolonged government shutdown of the dod were to occur it could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders and could limit the us government’s ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments and our ability to perform on our us government contracts and successfully compete for new work 

we believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment would have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending other defense spending cuts challenges in the appropriations process the debt ceiling and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions prosecutions litigation and other legal proceedings particularly those involving governments including federal state and outside the us we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions and administrative civil or criminal litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts commercial transactions false claims false statements antitrust mischarging contract performance fraud procurement integrity products liability warranty liability the use of hazardous materials personal injury claims environmental shareholder derivative actions prior acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property tax employees exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety accidents launch failures and employee benefits and plans including plan administration and improper payments as well as matters relating to the former orbital atk inc and our acquisition of that company including the ftc decision and order related to it these matters could divert financial and management resources result in administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions which terms include judgments or convictions and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements compensatory treble or other damages nonmonetary relief or actions or other liabilities and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards government regulations provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute enforcement action or litigation even if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business obtain and retain awards or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase reasons for increased estimated contract costs may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs and aim to protect against these risks through contract terms and conditions when practical 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than costtype contracts in 2019 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss 

our fixedprice contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in adjustments to those estimates 

under costtype contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise we also may face additional financial risk due to an increasing number of contract solicitations requiring the contractor to bid on costtype development work and related fixedprice production lots andor options in one submission or costtype development work requiring the contractor to provide certain items to the customer at the contractor’s expense or at little or no fee 

because of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business including our participation in joint ventures and other joint business arrangements and our global supply chain is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

 9  

northrop grumman corporation 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation laws and regulations relating to exportimport controls sanctions technology transfer restrictions government contracts and procurement data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups antihuman trafficking taxes environment immunity security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative civil commercial or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our exportimport privileges our customers outside of the us generally have the ability to terminate contracts for default based on performance suspension or debarment or termination of a contract due to default in particular could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally 

changes in laws regulations political leadership and environment andor security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets including sales to customers outside the us and purchases from suppliers outside the us our international business may be impacted by changes in us and foreign national policies and priorities and geopolitical relationships any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment political leadership geopolitical uncertainties world events bilateral and multilateral relationships government budgets and economic and political factors more generally and any of which could impact funding for programs our ability to perform andor export authorizations or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s anticipated exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business for example the tightening of credit in financial markets outside of the us could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments 

our contracts with nonus customers may also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other operational or financial obligations including offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements they may also require us to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees andor other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations we also increasingly are dependent on incountry suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts and applicable laws particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis we face risks related to our products that are approved for export but may be subject to the us government changing or canceling the export license after the product is ordered our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business 

more broadly our ability effectively to pursue and execute contracts outside the us also may be impacted by our ability to partner successfully with nonus companies including through joint ventures teaming agreements coproduction or other arrangements in support of such pursuits this risk includes the ability to timely identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with local partners as well as potential exposure for their actions this risk may increase depending on local requirements regarding who we partner with and under what circumstances particularly where we are effectively required to partner with governmentaffiliated entities 

the products and services we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees subcontractors or other third parties andor increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

 we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information false claims procurement integrity cost accounting and billing competition information security and data privacy or the terms of our contracts however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct despite a vigorous compliance program this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally and do business with new partners in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures with that term used throughout to refer to joint efforts or business arrangements of any type we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business including our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners and joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties liabilities and the loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to and to harm sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security and viability of our facilities infrastructure and supply chain and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including our supply chain and joint ventures face similar threats and growing requirements although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities theft of data harm to personnel infrastructure or products and financial liabilities as well as damage to our reputation as a government contractor and provider of cyberrelated or cyberprotected goods and services 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners corruption of data networks or systems harm to individuals and loss of assets in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these various factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business contractual or regulatory actions and potential liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials chemicals and components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property provide information about the parts they supply to us and perform some of the services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have various impacts on the company including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products materials or information or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract changes in political or economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or sanctions or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier including changes in ownership or operations as well as their ability to retain talent and other resources and requirements or changes in requirements imposed on them by other customers could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform or their inability to perform adequately could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers this risk may increase as the demands grow for our subcontractors and suppliers to meet extensive governmentrelated cyber and other requirements 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements both domestically and internationally many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers in some cases there may be only one supplier or one domestic supplier for certain components for example a single domestic source currently supplies us as well as the us domestic solid propellant industry with a principal raw material used in the production of solid rocket motors if a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and contract terms including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws and regulations including cybersecurity requirements 

if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in deliveries of needed products materials or services or if they do not comply with all applicable laws regulations requirements and contract terms including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper our financial position results of operations andor cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although often customary in government contracting increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity privacy information protection recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts antihuman trafficking specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations terms and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in

addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us or our business partners 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally largely as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to government accounting matters and business systems for current and past years as well as a lengthened period of time required to close open audits and the risk of withholding of payments for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs including environmental are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be among others also may affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal and state laws regulations contract terms and requirements related to our industry our products and the businesses we operate these laws and regulations include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act false claims act procurement integrity act federal communications commission act cas far international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act export administration regulations promulgated under the export control reform act close the contractor fraud loophole act and fcpa as well as rules and regulations administered by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives if we are found to have violated any such requirements or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of exportimport privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we are also seeing a significant number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

 our operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math additionally as we grow our international business it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience in addition in a tightened labor market we are facing increased competition for talent both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies if qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages slowdowns or other laborrelated disruptions any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments including some under highly demanding operating conditions to accomplish challenging missions problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components or subcontractor performance could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations could negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement unintended explosions or similar events problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials inadequate delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received or replacement obligations 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that also entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed or enforced differently over time compliance with these

northrop grumman corporation 

environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including suspension and debarment for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including individual and class actions relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages fines penalties and nonmonetary relief and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage 

we are engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation and other costs and liabilities related to environmental conditions in bethpage the remediation standards or requirements to which we are subject are being reconsidered and may change and costs may increase materially the state of new york has notified us that it intends to seek to impose additional remedial requirements and among other things is evaluating natural resource damages in addition we are a party to various and expect to become a party to additional legal proceedings and disputes related to remediation costs allowability andor alleged environmental impacts in bethpage including with federal and state entities the united states navy local municipalities and water districts and insurance carriers as well as class action and individual plaintiffs alleging personal injury and property damage and seeking both monetary and nonmonetary relief these bethpage matters could result in additional costs fines penalties sanctions compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages determinations on allocation allowability and coverage and nonmonetary relief 

in addition government and private parties could seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have significant operations including centers of excellence located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes other damaging storms water levels forest fires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters and delays in recovery may be significant 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid responsible highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters space launches hazardous operations and products liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the availability or timing of recovery and may impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available can be difficult to obtain are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services with our acquisition of legacy orbital atk in 2018 we have expanded our portfolio to include energetic materials including products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements all of these activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclear or launchrelated incidents or unintended initiation of energetic materials including risk of personal injury and property damage to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and to failed launches of spacecraft we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear launch or explosive incident among others whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks but those protections may not be available and they are limited in scope 

certain of our products such as small medium and large caliber ammunition and solid rocket motors and liquid propulsion engines involve the use manufacture andor handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials from time to time these activities have resulted in incidents such as an explosion at the lake city army ammunition plant in 2017 that have caused workplace injuries and fatalities the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing processes production delays environmental harm and expense fines and liability to third parties we have safety and loss prevention programs which provide for preconstruction reviews of process changes and new operations along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials to attempt to mitigate such incidents as well as insurance coverage we and our customers may experience similar or more serious incidents in the future which could result in various liabilities and production delays 

in addition our customers may otherwise use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky creating potential liabilities to our customers andor our company as the provider of such products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities an incident related to the use of energetics or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available to cover our losses and liabilities it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and opb plans defined benefit pension and opb obligations and related expenses as recorded in our financial statements are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums for certain of our defined benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and minimum required contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

investment performance of plan assets changes in assumptions associated with our pension and opb plans and government challenges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms we may not be able adequately to exploit protect or access intellectual property and the conduct of our customers competitors and suppliers may make it more difficult for us to do so 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and may seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they have or should have the right to do so governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could reduce our ability to develop protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants teammates and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts may require us to access and use third party intellectual property this may require that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

 17  

northrop grumman corporation 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally in addition our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends in part on continued funding for and investment in research and development projects our success also depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we are unable to develop new products and technologies or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability as they did in 2017 upon passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

the distribution distribution by alliant techsystems inc atk of the shares of vista outdoor inc vista and atk’s acquisition of orbital sciences corporation orbital to create then orbital atk the orbitalatk merger were intended to qualify as taxfree to atk atk’s stockholders vista and orbital for us income tax purposes however there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will agree with the conclusion of the parties and their counsel regarding the tax treatment of the distribution and orbitalatk merger if the distribution or certain related transactions were taxable atk’s shareholders immediately prior to the distribution could be required to recognize income on their receipt of vista outdoor stock in the distribution atk could be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain of its assets to vista outdoor and vista could be subject to income taxes 

under the tax matters agreement between orbital atk and vista the tax matters agreement in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations vista is required to indemnify orbital atk against taxes on the distribution that arise as a result of actions or failures to act by vista or as a result of section 355e of the internal revenue code applying due to acquisitions of vista stock after the distribution in other cases however we might recognize a taxable gain on the distribution without being entitled to an indemnification payment under the tax matters agreement if such tax is imposed on vista then we may depending on the circumstances be required to indemnify vista for that tax 

changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations the interpretation or application thereof or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 goodwill accounts for approximately 46 percent of our total assets although we currently have excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions additionally we acquired a significant amount of purchased intangible and other longlived assets in the merger whose recovery is dependent in part on future business conditions we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived

assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this form 10k as well as part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017 

acquisition of orbital atk 

on june 6 2018 the “merger date” the company completed its previously announced acquisition of orbital atk inc “orbital atk” the “merger” on the merger date orbital atk became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to northrop grumman innovation systems inc we established innovation systems as a new fourth business sector the operating results of innovation systems subsequent to the merger date have been included in the company’s consolidated financial results see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of orbital atk 

in june 2018 the us federal trade commission ftc issued a decision and order enabling the acquisition to proceed and providing for solid rocket motors to be available on a nondiscriminatory basis under certain circumstances and processes the company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the order similarly the compliance officer appointed under the order and the ftc have taken and continue to take various actions to oversee compliance in october 2019 the company received a civil investigative demand from the ftc requesting certain information relating to a potential issue of the company’s compliance with the order in connection with a pending strategic missile competition the company has provided information in response to the request we believe the company has been and continues to be in full compliance with the order but we cannot predict any potential impact on the procurement 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions diverse regional security concerns and political instability global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

the global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2020 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility the global economy may also be affected by britain’s anticipated exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time additionally economic tensions and changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements could impact the global market for defense products services and solutions 

us political and economic environment 

the us continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years 

in 2019 the president proposed an fy 2020 budget requesting 750 billion for national security the president’s budget request addresses various capabilities highlighted in the us national security strategy the national defense strategy and the missile defense review on august 2 2019 the bipartisan budget act of 2019 was enacted increasing spending caps under the budget control act bca for fy 2020 and fy 2021 the final two fiscal years covered by the bca and suspending the debt ceiling through july 31 2021 on december 20 2019 fy 2020 appropriations for all federal agencies were enacted representing a 3 percent increase from fy 2019 we believe our capabilities particularly in space missiles missile defense hypersonics counterhypersonics low observable technology and cyber will allow us to continue to profitably grow our business in support of our customers’ needs 

the political environment federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically larger contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts as control is transferred to the customer primarily over time on a costtocost basis cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor subcontractor material overhead and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance andor contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels and performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type andor life cycle eg costtype fixedprice development production andor sustainment 

consolidated operating results 

for purposes of the operating results discussion below we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures exclude marktomarket pension and opb “mtm” expense benefit and related tax impacts and are described as mtmadjusted net earnings and mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the nonoperational impact of pension and opb actuarial gains and losses these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of mtm accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards we reconcile these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below these nongaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below

northrop grumman corporation 

  

sales 

2019 sales increased 37 billion reflecting a full year of sales from innovation systems as well as higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems partially offset by lower sales at technology services 

see “segment operating results” below for further information by segment and “product and service analysis” for product and service detail see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type contract type and geographic region for each of our segments 

operating income and margin rate 

2019 operating income increased 189 million  or 5 percent  primarily due to a 462 million increase in segment operating income which includes a full year of operating income from innovation systems this was partially offset by a 148 million decrease in the net fas servicecas pension adjustment and a 125 million increase in unallocated corporate expense  all of which are further discussed in “segment operating results” operating margin rate declined to 117 percent from 126 percent due to the pension and unallocated corporate expense items noted above partially offset by a higher segment operating margin rate  as described in “segment operating results” 

2019 ga costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 97 percent from 100 percent  primarily due to higher sales as well as cost management including cost synergies realized in connection with the 2018 acquisition of orbital atk 

for further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses see “product and service analysis” below 

marktomarket pension and opb expense benefit 

the primary components of pretax mtm expense benefit are presented in the table below 



2019 mtm expense of 18 billion was primarily driven by a 92 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2018 as well as a change in our mortality assumptions partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 191 percent compared to our 80 percent asset return assumption 

federal and foreign income taxes 

the 2019 effective tax rate decreased to 118 percent from 137 percent in 2018  mtm expense reduced the 2019 effective tax rate by 37 percentage points and the 2018 effective tax rate by 11 percentage points see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

net earnings 

the table below reconciles net earnings to mtmadjusted net earnings 



 net earnings decreased 981 million in 2019 principally due to an 863 million increase in our mtm expense net of tax excluding these impacts mtmadjusted net earnings decreased by 118 million  or 3 percent  primarily due to a 397 million decrease in the total net fascas pension adjustment and 170 million of higher intangible asset 

 27  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

amortization and ppe stepup depreciation these decreases were partially offset by 462 million of higher segment operating income 

diluted earnings per share 

the table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share 



 diluted earnings per share decreased 527  or 29 percent  principally due to a 515 reduction associated with our mtm expense net of tax excluding these impacts mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 012  or 1 percent  reflecting a 3 percent decrease in mtmadjusted net earnings and a 3 percent decrease in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

the company is aligned in four operating sectors which also comprise our reportable segments aerospace systems innovation systems mission systems and technology services the segment operating results below include sales and operating income for innovation systems subsequent to the merger date for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see “business” 

we present our sectors in the following business areas which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities 

effective january 1 2019 the former advanced defense services and system modernization and services business areas of technology services were merged to create the global services business area this change had no impact on the prior segment operating results of technology services as a whole 

in september 2019 the company announced changes effective january 1 2020 which are intended to better align the company’s broad portfolio to serve its customers’ needs the four new sectors are aeronautics systems defense systems mission systems and space systems this realignment is not reflected in any of the accompanying financial information 

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below

northrop grumman corporation 

  

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the table below and segment operating margin rate segment operating income divided by sales are nongaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america measures that reflect total earnings from our four segments including allocated pension expense we have recognized under far and cas and excluding fas pension expense and unallocated corporate items certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or far and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors these measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 



 segment operating income and margin rate 

2019 segment operating income increased 462 million  or 13 percent  reflecting a full year of innovation systems operating income as well as higher operating income at the other three sectors segment operating margin rate o f 116 percent was comparable to the prior year 

net fas servicecas pension adjustment 

the decrease in our 2019 net fas servicecas pension adjustment is primarily due to lower cas expense largely as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2018 partially offset by increased cas expense due to the addition of innovation systems 

unallocated corporate expense 

the increase in 2019 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to the absence in 2019 of a 223 million benefit recognized for the finalization of certain prior year cost claims as well as 170 million of higher intangible asset amortization and ppe stepup depreciation this increase was partially offset by 140 million of lower deferred state taxes and an 89 million benefit recognized in 2019 related to the favorable resolution of a cost accounting litigation matter 

net estimateatcompletion eac adjustments  we record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion net eac adjustments using the cumulative catchup method of accounting net eac adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below 

 29  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

net eac adjustments by segment are presented in the table below 

 for purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate respectively 

aerospace systems 

sales 

2019 sales increased 766 million  or 6 percent  due in large part to higher volume on restricted programs in addition manned aircraft sales reflect a higher rate of f35 production activity and higher volume on the e2 program space sales reflect higher volume on next generation overhead persistent infrared  next gen opir  programs and the james webb space telescope jwst autonomous systems sales include higher global hawk volume and lower nato ags volume as that program nears completion 

operating income 

2019 operating income increased 23 million  or 2 percent  due to higher sales 2019 operating margin rate decreased to 103 percent from 108 percent principally due to lower net favorable eac adjustments 

innovation systems 

the sales and operating income in the table above reflect the operating results of innovation systems subsequent to the merger date in our comparative discussion below we reference pro forma sales prepared in accordance with article 11 of regulation sx and computed as if the merger had been completed as of january 1 2017 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional supplemental consolidated pro forma financial information this pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative of the results that would have actually occurred if the merger had been consummated on january 1 2017 nor are they indicative of future results 

sales 

2019 sales increased 541 million  or 10 percent  compared with 2018 pro forma sales of 56 billion due to higher sales in all three business areas flight systems sales reflect higher volume on military aerospace structures and launch vehicles space systems sales reflect higher volume on national security satellite systems defense systems sales increased due to higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems including the aargmer and guided m ultiple launch rocket system programs  

 30  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating income 

2019 operating income totaled 671 million and operating margin rate was 110 percent  year to date results benefited from favorable negotiations on certain contracts 

mission systems 

sales 

2019 sales increased 554 million  or 5 percent  due to higher sales in all three business areas advanced capabilities sales increased principally due to higher volume on restricted and marine systems programs sensors and processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on airborne radar and restricted programs partially offset by lower volume on communications programs cyber and isr sales increased principally due to higher volume on space and restricted programs 

operating income 

2019 operating income increased 119 million  or 8 percent  due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate operating margin rate increased to 134 percent from 130 percent primarily due to improved performance on advanced capabilities and sensors and processing programs partially offset by lower performance on cyber and isr programs  

technology services 

sales 

2019 sales decreased 187 million  or 4 percent  primarily due to program completions across the sector global services sales declined principally due to the 2018 completions of a state and local services contract and the jrdc program partially offset by higher volume on a civil program global logistics and modernization sales declined primarily due to the 2018 completion of the kc10 program partially offset by higher volume on electronic systems sustainment programs 

operating income 

2019 operating income increased 14 million  or 3 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 111 percent from 103 percent primarily due to improved performance in both business areas including a favorable adjustment on a global logistics and modernization sustainment program

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

 product sales and costs 

2019 product sales increased 37 billion  or 17 percent  primarily due to a full year of product sales from innovation systems and higher volume on restricted f35 and next gen opir programs at aerospace systems 

2019 product costs increased 34 billion  or 17 percent  consistent with the higher product sales described above 

service sales and costs 

2019 service sales increased 261 million  or 2 percent  the increase was primarily driven by a full year of service sales from innovation systems and higher service sales at mission systems partially offset by lower service sales at technology services principally due to program completions 

2019 service costs increased 127 million  or 1 percent  consistent with the higher service sales described above and reflects improved margin rates on service contracts at each sector 

backlog 

backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period it comprises both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

 32  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2019 and 2018  



liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 22 billion  approximately 269 million was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities commercial paper andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months capital expenditure commitments were 790 million at december 31 2019  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



 2019 cash provided by operating activities increased 470 million principally due to improved trade working capital and lower pension contributions 

free cash flow 

free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions the payment of dividends and share repurchases this nongaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with gaap 

 33  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2019 free cash flow increased 455 million principally driven by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities 

investing cash flow 

2019 net cash used in investing activities decreased to 12 billion from 89 billion principally due to 77 billion paid in 2018 for the acquisition of orbital atk net of cash acquired 

financing cash flow 

2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased to 24 billion from 46 billion principally due to lower debt and credit facility repayments of 21 billion and lower share repurchases partially offset by net repayments of commercial paper in 2019 as compared to net borrowings in 2018 

share repurchases – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs 

commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes – see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements – see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

other sources of capital – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2019  we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest make payments under operating leases settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities payments due under these obligations and commitments and the estimated timing of those payments are as follows 



  

 the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and opb plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements further details

regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 10 and 15  respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services 

contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost since our contracts typically span a period of several years estimation of revenue cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science cost estimates on fixedprice development contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in those estimates as well as financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include changes in or resolution of identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income  see “segment operating results” and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement benefits 

overview – the determination of projected benefit obligations the fair value of plan assets and pension and opb expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and 

 35  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the effects of changing assumptions ie actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 339 percent at december 31 2019  and 431 percent at december 31 2018  

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2019 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2019 pension and opb obligations which would be reflected in the 2019 mtm expense benefit and 2020 expected pension and opb expense 



cash balance crediting rate – a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the current 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm expense benefit the minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 225 percent  the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 239 percent as of december 31 2019  growing to 264 percent by 2025  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2019 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2019 pension benefit obligation which would be reflected in the 2019 mtm expense benefit and 2020 expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans however we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable 

during 2019  the investment committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations the current asset allocation is approximately 40 public equities 30 fixedincome and 30 alternatives which reflects a shift of approximately 5 from public equities to alternatives at this time the investment committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 36  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2019 was approximately 111 percent and our 20year and 30year rolling average rates of return were approximately 71 percent and 97 percent  respectively each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses our 2019 actual net plan asset returns were approximately 191 percent  

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

for determining 2019 fas expense we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent and an expected longterm rate of return on opb plan assets of 767 percent  for 2020 fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent and 766 percent on opb plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2019 eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2020 expected pension and opb expense 



in addition holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2020 mtm expense benefit 



estimated fair market value of plan assets – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected in october 2019 the soa issued an updated mortality base table the private retirement plans mortality table for 2012 pri2012 as well as an updated mortality improvement scale mp2019 the updated model is based on a comprehensive study which shifted the bluewhite collar mix in prior tables more toward blue collar in the pri2012 table considering our employee population we performed a study of our recent actual pension plan mortality experience to determine whether the pri2012 table’s shift toward blue collar was appropriate for our company after considering the additional information released by the soa in october 2019 and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience we adopted the pri2012 white collar table along with their projection scale but with a longterm improvement rate of 075 versus 10 assumed by the soa accordingly we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31 2019  and the amounts estimated for our 2020 pension and opb expense 

for further information regarding our pension and opb plans see “risk factors” and notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes enforcement actions investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of 

 37  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters  – we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology as we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets current portion and other noncurrent assets until charged to contracts we use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs assessing among other things us government regulations our us government contract mix and past practices portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed 

income tax matters – the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim requires the use of judgment we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim the company follows a recognition and measurement approach considering the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date judgment is exercised by the company in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information the technical merits of its position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position in measuring the tax position the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations during 2019  we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 319 million related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 tax act 

for further information on litigation commitments and contingencies see “risk factors” and note 1  note 7  note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 

overview – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date the most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customerrelated intangible assets including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships we determine the fair value of those customerrelated intangible assets based on estimates and judgments including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates and discount rates in some cases we use discounted cash flow analyses which are based on estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance 

impairment testing – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

 38  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

we test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group if such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount we recognize a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of 382 million at december 31 2019  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm borrowings under our credit facilities for which there was £60 million the equivalent of approximately 78 million as of december 31 2019  outstanding at december 31 2019  at december 31 2019  we have 139 billion of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 151 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2019  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 98 million were outstanding at december 31 2019  a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

selected financial data 

for a summary of selected consolidated financial information see “selected financial data” under part ii  item 6 

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 82 percent  85 percent  and 84 percent  of sales during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively for further information on sales by customer category see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal civil markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton general dynamics harris l3 technologies leidos leonardo lockheed martin raytheon and thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2018  total backlog which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations was 535 billion  as compared with 426 billion  at december 31 2017  for further information see “backlog” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property

northrop grumman corporation 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our approximately 85000  employees approximately 4800  are covered by 16  collective agreements in the us of which we negotiated three  renewals in 2018  and expect to negotiate two  renewals in 2019  see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to employee relations 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

certain classified programs with the us government are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed and are therefore generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefits costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two contract types 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

fixedprice contracts  – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development lowrate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination of a contract or contracts for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations ultimately approved by congress and the president or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

the us continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years

most recently on february 9 2018 congress passed the bipartisan budget act bba of 2018 which raised the statutory budget caps for defense spending including for overseas contingency operations oco by 80 billion for fy 2018 and by 85 billion for fy 2019 the bba also raised nondefense spending by 63 billion for fy 2018 and 68 billion for fy 2019 and suspended the debt ceiling until march 1 2019 the original spending caps established by the bca will return for fy 2020 and fy 2021 without another statutory change similarly the suspension of the debt ceiling is expected to end on march 1 2019 absent further action    

on march 23 2018 the president signed the omnibus appropriations act for fy 2018 which provided 13 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies in total for fy 2018 congress appropriated approximately 700 billion for national security including approximately 630 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately 70 billion in oco funding   

on september 28 2018 fullyear appropriations for fy 2019 were enacted representing over half of discretionary federal spending for fy 2019 congress appropriated approximately 716 billion for national security including approximately 647 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately 69 billion in oco funding a continuing resolution was approved to provide further funding for other agencies including nasa and other civil agencies through december 7 2018 which was subsequently extended through december 21 2018 on december 22 2018 us government agencies that had not yet received fullyear appropriations and did not otherwise have funding entered into a temporary shutdown on january 25 2019 a third continuing resolution was enacted which funds these agencies through february 15 2019 

the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular 

the budget environment including budget caps mandated by the bca for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling and the appropriations processes remain significant short and longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the administration and congress what challenges budget reductions required by the bca and otherwise will present for the defense industry and whether annual appropriations bills for all agencies will be enacted for fy 2020 if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted for fy 2020 or beyond the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets and we may face another government shutdown of unknown duration if a prolonged government shutdown of the dod were to occur it could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders and could limit the us government’s ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments and our ability to perform on our us government contracts and successfully compete for new work 

we believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment would have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the bca other defense spending cuts challenges in the appropriations process the debt ceiling and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation and other legal proceedings particularly those involving governments we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions and administrative civil or criminal litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts commercial transactions false claims false statements mischarging contract performance fraud procurement integrity products liability warranty liability the use of hazardous materials personal injury

claims environmental shareholder derivative actions prior acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property tax employees exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety accidents launch failures employee benefits and plans including plan administration and improper payments as well as matters relating to the former orbital atk inc and our acquisition of that company these matters could divert financial and management resources result in administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions which terms include judgments or convictions and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements compensatory treble or other damages nonmonetary relief or actions or other liabilities and otherwise harm our business government regulations provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute enforcement action or litigation even if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase reasons for increased estimated contract costs may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs and aim to protect against these risks through contract terms and conditions when practical 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than costtype contracts in 2018 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss 

our fixedprice contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in adjustments to those estimates 

under costtype contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise we also may face additional financial risk due to an increasing number of contract solicitations requiring the contractor to bid on costtype development work and related fixedprice production lots andor options in one submission or costtype development work requiring the contractor to provide certain items to the customer at the contractor’s expense or at little or no fee

because of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business including our participation in joint ventures and other joint business arrangements is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions government contracts and procurement data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups antihuman trafficking taxes environment immunity security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative civil commercial or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges our customers outside of the us generally have the ability to terminate contracts for default based on performance suspension or debarment or termination of a contract due to default in particular could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally 

changes in laws regulations political leadership and environment or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets our international business may be impacted by changes in us and foreign national policies and priorities and geopolitical relationships any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment political leadership geopolitical uncertainties world events bilateral and multilateral relationships government budgets and economic and political factors more generally and any of which could impact funding for programs alter export authorizations or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s anticipated exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business for example the tightening of credit in financial markets outside of the us could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments 

our contracts with nonus customers may also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other operational or financial obligations including offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements they may also require us to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees andor other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations we also increasingly are dependent on incountry suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts and applicable laws particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis we face risks related to our products that are approved for export but may be subject to the us government changing or canceling the export license after the product is ordered our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business 

more broadly our ability effectively to pursue and execute contracts outside the us also may be impacted by our ability to partner successfully with nonus companies including through joint ventures teaming agreements co

production or other arrangements in support of such pursuits this risk includes the ability to timely identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with local partners as well as potential exposure for their actions 

the products and services we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees subcontractors or other third parties andor increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information false claims procurement integrity cost accounting and billing competition information security and data privacy or the terms of our contracts however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct despite a vigorous compliance program this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures with that term used throughout to refer to joint efforts or business arrangements of any type we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business including our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners and joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties liabilities and the loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities infrastructure and supply chain and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including our supply chain and joint ventures face similar threats although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities theft of data harm to personnel infrastructure or products and financial liabilities as well as damage to our reputation as a government contractor and provider of cyberrelated or cyberprotected goods and services 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business contractual or regulatory

actions and potential liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials chemicals and components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property and perform some of the services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have various impacts on the company including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier including changes in ownership or operations could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform or their inability to perform adequately could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements both domestically and internationally many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers in some cases there may be only one supplier or one domestic supplier for certain components for example a single domestic source currently supplies us as well as the us domestic solid propellant industry with a principal raw material used in the production of solid rocket motors if a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and contract terms including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws and regulations including cybersecurity requirements 

if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in deliveries of needed products materials or services or if they do not comply with all applicable laws regulations requirements and contract terms including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper our financial position results of operations andor cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although often customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity privacy recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts antihuman trafficking specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our 

 12  

northrop grumman corporation 

compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us or our business partners 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be also may affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws regulations and requirements related to our industry our products and the businesses we operate these laws and regulations include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act false claims act procurement integrity act federal communications commission act cas far international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act close the contractor fraud loophole act and fcpa as well as rules and regulations administered by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives if we are found to have violated such requirements or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of export privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we are also seeing a significant number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

 13  

northrop grumman corporation 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could over time have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math additionally as we grow our international business it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience in addition in a tightened labor market we are facing increased competition for talent both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies if qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages slowdowns or other laborrelated disruptions any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments including some under highly demanding operating conditions problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components or subcontractor performance could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations could negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials inadequate delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received or replacement obligations 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that also entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed or enforced differently over time compliance with these environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including suspension and debarment for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including individual and class actions relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages fines penalties and nonmonetary relief and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage 

we are engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation and other costs and liabilities related to environmental conditions in bethpage the remediation standards or requirements to which we are subject may change and costs may increase materially the state of new york has notified us that it intends to seek to impose additional remedial requirements and among other things is evaluating natural resource damages we are and expect we may further become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes related to remediation andor alleged environmental impacts in bethpage including with federal and state entities local municipalities and water districts insurance carriers and individual and class action plaintiffs these matters could result in fines penalties sanctions compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages determinations on allocation allowability and coverage and nonmonetary relief and actions 

in addition government and private parties could seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes other damaging storms forest fires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters may be significant 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters space launches hazardous operations and products liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of recovery and may impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred

 we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services with our acquisition of legacy orbital atk we have expanded our portfolio to include energetic materials including products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements all of these activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclear or launchrelated incidents or unintended initiation of energetic materials including risk of personal injury and property damage to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and to failed launches of spacecraft we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear or launch incident among others whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks 

certain of our innovation systems products including products from its defense systems business such as small medium and large caliber ammunition and its flight systems business such as solid rocket motors and liquid propulsion engines involve the use manufacture andor handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials from time to time these activities have resulted in incidents such as an explosion at the lake city army ammunition plant in 2017 that have caused workplace injuries and fatalities the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing processes production delays environmental harm and expense fines and liability to third parties we have safety and loss prevention programs which provide for detailed preconstruction reviews of process changes and new operations along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials to mitigate such incidents as well as insurance coverage we and our customers may experience similar or more serious incidents in the future which could result in various liabilities and production delays 

in addition our customers may otherwise use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky creating potential liabilities to our customers andor our company as the provider of such products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities an incident related to the use of energetics or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and opb plans defined benefit pension and opb obligations and related expenses as recorded in our financial statements are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and opb plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums for certain of our defined benefit plans and our health and welfare plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and minimum required contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

investment performance of plan assets and changes in assumptions associated with our pension and opb plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 on june 6 2018 the company completed the acquisition of orbital atk inc which is now our new innovation systems sector we believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings enhance our ability to provide innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements create value for shareholders and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees however in the course of integrating our business with the legacy orbital atk business we may discover additional information about the legacy orbital atk business including its financial controls and potential risks opportunities and liabilities that alters our assessment of the anticipated benefits costs and risks of the acquisition additionally our customers may not value our combined businesses and capabilities as much as we anticipate in which case we may not realize the benefits of our combined business to the extent we currently anticipate or at all 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend to a significant extent on our ability to integrate the legacy orbital atk business with ours the integration of an independent business with our business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process costs may include among other things those associated with facilities and systems consolidation operational impacts severance and other potential employmentrelated costs as well as fees paid to financial legal and other advisors we are devoting significant management attention and resources effectively to integrate the legacy orbital atk business and operations with our business including integration of internal controls processes and procedures and to realize the anticipated benefits the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively may not result in the realization of the expected benefits of the acquisition including enhanced product offerings the consummation of the acquisition has triggered change in control and other similar provisions in certain agreements to which legacy orbital atk is a party and otherwise affected contractual relationships which could have an adverse impact on the combined business if we are unable to address such issues successfully the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the legacy orbital atk business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities 

the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms we may not be 

 17  

northrop grumman corporation 

able adequately to exploit protect or access intellectual property and the conduct of our customers competitors and suppliers may make it more difficult for us to do so 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and may seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us governments have increased certain efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could reduce our ability to develop protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments have also declined at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts may require us to access and use third party intellectual property this may require that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement or third party claims or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally in addition our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends in part on continued funding for and investment in research and development projects our success also depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we are unable to develop new products and technologies or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 goodwill accounts for approximately 50 percent  of our total assets although we currently have excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions additionally we acquired a significant amount of purchased 

 18  

northrop grumman corporation 

intangible and other longlived assets in the merger whose recovery is dependent in part on future business conditions we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability as they did in 2017 upon passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

the distribution distribution by alliant techsystems inc atk of the shares of vista outdoor inc vista   and atk’s acquisition of orbital sciences corporation orbital to create then orbital atk the orbitalatk merger were intended to qualify as taxfree to atk atk’s stockholders vista and orbital for us income tax purposes however there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will agree with the conclusion of the parties and their counsel regarding the tax treatment of the distribution and orbitalatk merger if the distribution or certain related transactions were taxable atk’s shareholders immediately prior to the distribution could be required to recognize income on their receipt of vista outdoor stock in the distribution atk could be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain of its assets to vista outdoor and vista could be subject to income taxes 

under the tax matters agreement between orbital atk and vista the tax matters agreement in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations vista is required to indemnify orbital atk against taxes on the distribution that arise as a result of actions or failures to act by vista or as a result of section 355e of the internal revenue code applying due to acquisitions of vista stock after the distribution in other cases however we might recognize a taxable gain on the distribution without being entitled to an indemnification payment under the tax matters agreement if such tax is imposed on vista then we may depending on the circumstances be required to indemnify vista for that tax 

changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations the interpretation or application thereof or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

as previously announced effective january 1 2018 we adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  and asu no 201707 compensation retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  using the full retrospective method 

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2018 we changed our gaap accounting method related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit opb plans the “accounting change” prior to the accounting change actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  upon annual remeasurement and were amortized into earnings in future periods on a planbyplan basis when they exceeded the accounting corridor a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required   under the new method actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in net periodic benefit cost through marktomarket pension and opb “mtm” expense benefit upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

our 2017 and 2016 results below have been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of asc topic 606 and asu 201707 and the accounting change as described in notes 1  13  16  17  and 18  to the consolidated financial statements 

acquisition of orbital atk 

on june 6 2018 the “merger date” the company completed its previously announced acquisition of orbital atk inc “orbital atk” the “merger” by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of orbital atk for a purchase price of 77 billion   in cash on the merger date orbital atk became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and its name was changed to northrop grumman innovation systems inc we established innovation systems as a new fourth business sector  whose main products include launch vehicles and related propulsion systems missile products and defense electronics precision weapons armament systems and ammunition satellites and associated space components and services and advanced aerospace structures  the acquisition was financed with proceeds from the company’s debt financing completed in october 2017 and cash on hand we believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements create value for shareholders and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees   see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of orbital atk 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions diverse regional security concerns and political instability global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

the global geopolitical and economic environments also continue to be impacted by uncertainty geopolitical relationships are changing and global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2019 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility the global economy may also be affected by britain’s anticipated exit from the european union the full impact of which is not known at this time additionally economic tensions and changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements could impact the global market for defense products services and solutions 

us political and economic environment 

the us continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending across a tenyear period fy 2012 through fy 2021 including specific limits for defense and nondefense spending in prior years these spending caps have been revised by separate bills for specific fiscal years    

most recently on february 9 2018 congress passed the bipartisan budget act bba of 2018 which raised the statutory budget caps for defense spending including for overseas contingency operations oco by 80 billion for fy 2018 and by 85 billion for fy 2019 the bba also raised nondefense spending by 63 billion for fy 2018 and 68 billion for fy 2019 and suspended the debt ceiling until march 1 2019 the original spending caps 

 25  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

established by the bca will return for fy 2020 and fy 2021 without another statutory change similarly the suspension of the debt ceiling is expected to end on march 1 2019 absent further action    

on march 23 2018 the president signed the omnibus appropriations act for fy 2018 which provided 13 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies in total for fy 2018 congress appropriated approximately 700 billion for national security including approximately 630 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately 70 billion in oco funding   

on september 28 2018 fullyear appropriations for fy 2019 were enacted representing over half of discretionary federal spending for fy 2019 congress appropriated approximately 716 billion for national security including approximately 647 billion for base discretionary funding and approximately 69 billion in oco funding a continuing resolution was approved to provide further funding for other agencies including nasa and other civil agencies through december 7 2018 which was subsequently extended through december 21 2018 on december 22 2018 us government agencies that had not yet received fullyear appropriations and did not otherwise have funding entered into a temporary shutdown on january 25 2019 a third continuing resolution was enacted which funds these agencies through february 15 2019 

the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have significant impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically larger contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts as control is transferred to the customer primarily over time on a costtocost basis cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor subcontractor material overhead and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume while changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance andor contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels and performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type andor lifecycle eg costtype fixedprice development production andor sustainment 

consolidated operating results 

for purposes of the operating results discussion below we assess our financial and operating performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures exclude mtm expense benefit and related tax impacts and are described as mtmadjusted net earnings and mtmadjusted diluted earnings per share these nongaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the nonoperational impact of pension and opb actuarial gains and losses these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of mtm accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards we reconcile these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below these nongaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

2018  –  sales increased   41 billion  or 16 percent  as compared with 2017  due to the addition of 33 billion of sales from innovation systems and higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems partially offset by lower sales at technology services 

2017  – sales increased   13 billion  or 5 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems

marktomarket pension and opb adjustment 

the primary components of pretax mtm expense benefit are presented in the table below 



2018  – mtm expense of 655 million  in 2018  was primarily driven by actual net plan asset losses of approximately 35 percent  partially offset by actuarial gains principally resulting from a 63 basis point increase in the discount rate in 2017  we recognized a mtm benefit of 536 million  as described below 

2017  – mtm benefit of 536 million  in 2017  was primarily driven by actual net plan asset returns of approximately 164 percent partially offset by actuarial losses principally resulting from a 51 basis point decrease in the discount rate mtm expense of 950 million  in 2016  was primarily driven by actuarial losses largely resulting from a 34 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2018  – our effective tax rate for 2018  was lower  than 2017  primarily due to the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” as discussed in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements

2018   –   segment operating income for 2018   increased   544 million  or 19 percent  as compared with 2017  and includes the addition of 343 million  of operating income from innovation systems and higher operating income at aerospace systems and mission systems the higher operating income includes 69 million  of favorable eac adjustments on multiple restricted programs at aerospace systems segment operating margin rate increased  to 115 percent  from 112 percent  in 2017  principally due to higher segment margin rates at each of the legacy northrop grumman sectors 

2017   –   segment operating income for 2017   increased   39 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher operating income at aerospace systems partially offset by lower operating income at mission systems and technology services the higher operating income includes a 56 million  favorable eac adjustment at aerospace systems on a restricted program largely related to performance incentives and 54 million  recognized in connection with a claim related to certain costs incurred in prior years the “2017 cost claim” segment operating margin rate decreased  to 112 percent  from 116 percent  in 2016 principally due to lower segment margin rates at mission systems and aerospace systems 

reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income  the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of the net fas servicecas pension adjustment as well as unallocated corporate expenses certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or far and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net fas servicecas pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expense

 net fas servicecas pension adjustment 

2018  – the decrease  in our net fas servicecas pension adjustment as compared with 2017 is primarily due to lower cas expense for legacy northrop grumman resulting from higher assets returns in 2017 and a change in the legacy northrop grumman mortality assumption as of december 31 2017 which more than offset the additional net fas servicecas pension adjustment from the addition of innovation systems 

2017  – the increase  in our net fas servicecas pension adjustment as compared with 2016 is primarily due to higher cas expense resulting from the continued phasein of cas harmonization and the impact of actual demographic experience partially offset by a change in our mortality assumption as of december 31 2016 

unallocated corporate expense 

2018  – unallocated corporate expense for 2018   decreased   42 million  as compared with 2017  primarily due to a 223 million  benefit recognized for the finalization of certain prior year corporate cost claims resulting in a reduction of overhead reserves and an increase in our estimated recovery of certain environmental remediation costs and a 53 million  increase in mtmrelated deferred state tax benefit partially offset by 220 million  of intangible asset amortization and ppe stepup depreciation 

2017  – unallocated corporate expense for 2017   increased   280 million  as compared with 2016  primarily due to a 67 million  increase in mtmrelated deferred state tax expense 47 million  of costs associated with the orbital atk acquisition and 41 million  of deferred state tax expense resulting from state tax adjustments associated with the filing of our prior year federal tax return and the companys 500 million  discretionary pension contribution in december 2017 in addition the prior year period included a 35 million  benefit recognized for state tax refunds claimed on our prior year tax returns and a 25 million  benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries

aerospace systems 

2018   –   aerospace systems sales for 2018   increased   965 million  or 8 percent  as compared with 2017  due to higher volume in each of our three business areas principally on manned aircraft programs manned aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted and f35 volume autonomous systems sales reflect higher volume on several programs including triton partially offset by lower global hawk volume space sales reflect higher restricted and ground based strategic deterrent technology maturation risk reduction volume partially offset by lower intercompany and james webb space telescope jwst volume 

operating income for 2018   increased   122 million  or 9 percent  primarily due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate operating margin rate increased  to 108 percent  from 106 percent  principally due to improved performance including the previously noted 69 million  of favorable eac adjustments on multiple restricted programs in 2018 partially offset by the 56 million favorable eac adjustment recorded in 2017 

2017   –   aerospace systems sales for 2017   increased   13 billion  or 12 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher volume on manned aircraft programs manned aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted sales autonomous systems sales increased principally due to higher volume for several programs including triton partially offset by lower nato alliance ground surveillance ags volume space sales increased primarily due to higher restricted sales partially offset by lower volume on the jwst and advanced extremely high frequency aehf programs 

operating income for 2017   increased   91 million  or 8 percent  primarily due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate operating margin rate decreased  to 106 percent  from 110 percent  principally due to changes in contract mix on manned aircraft programs and a gain of 45 million  recognized in the prior year associated with the sale of a property partially offset by the previously discussed 56 million  favorable eac adjustment largely related to performance incentives 

innovation systems 

the sales and operating income above reflect the operating results of innovation systems subsequent to the merger date   in our comparative discussion below we reference pro forma sales prepared in accordance with article 11 of regulation sx and computed as if the merger had been completed as of january 1 2017 refer to note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for additional supplemental consolidated pro forma financial information this pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative of the results that would have actually occurred if the merger had been consummated on january 1 2017 nor are they indicative of future results 

2018   –   innovation systems sales for 2018 were 56 billion  and for 2017 were 48 billion  each on a pro forma basis the 08 billion or 17 percent  increase reflects higher volume in each business area defense systems sales reflect increased international volume on armament systems programs and increased volume on the antiradiation guided missile program and small caliber ammunition programs flight systems sales were primarily driven by higher groundbased midcourse defense a350 and f35 volume space systems sales increased primarily due to higher government satellite volume

mission systems 

2018   –   mission systems sales for 2018   increased   239 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2017  primarily due to higher sensors and processing volume partially offset by lower cyber and isr and advanced capabilities volume sensors and processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on restricted programs communications programs f35 and electroopticalinfrared eoir selfprotection programs cyber and isr sales decreased primarily due to rampdown on a restricted isr program advanced capabilities sales reflect lower volume on the joint national integration center research and development jrdc program and follow on activity partially offset by higher volume on several programs including the integrated air and missile defense battle command system program 

operating income for 2018   increased   78 million  or 5 percent  due to a higher operating margin rate and higher sales operating margin rate increased  to 130 percent  from 126 percent  primarily due to improved performance on cyber and isr and sensors and processing programs partially offset by a 32 million benefit recognized in the prior year in connection with the 2017 cost claim described above 

2017   –   mission systems sales for 2017   increased   309 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher sensors and processing volume partially offset by lower cyber and isr volume sensors and processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on f35 sensors eoir selfprotection programs communications programs and the sabr program these increases were partially offset by lower volume on international groundbased radar programs cyber and isr sales decreased primarily due to lower volume on restricted isr programs 

operating income for 2017   decreased   26 million  or 2 percent  primarily due to a lower operating margin rate partially offset by higher sales and 32 million recognized in connection with the 2017 cost claim described above operating margin rate decreased  to 126 percent  from 132 percent  primarily due to lower margin rates on sensors and processing and cyber and isr programs principally resulting from lower performance and changes in contract mix this decrease was partially offset by improved margin rates at advanced capabilities primarily due to the prior year including a 49 million  forward loss provision on an advanced capabilities program 

technology services 

2018   –   technology services sales for 2018   decreased   390 million  or 8 percent  as compared with 2017  due to lower volume on advanced defense services and system modernization and services programs partially offset by higher volume on global logistics and modernization programs advanced defense services and system modernization and services sales decreased primarily due to the completion of several programs including jrdc partially offset by higher volume on the saudi arabian ministry of national guard training support program through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results global logistics and modernization sales increased primarily due to higher volume for several programs including the special electronic mission aircraft program partially offset by lower volume from the completion of the kc10 program 

operating income for 2018   decreased   6 million  or 1 percent  primarily due to lower sales partially offset by a higher operating margin rate operating margin rate increased  to 103 percent  from 96 percent  primarily due to the closeout of a state it outsourcing program 

2017   –   technology services sales for 2017   decreased   78 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to lower volume on system modernization and services programs partially offset by higher volume on global logistics and modernization programs system modernization and services sales decreased principally due to the completion of several programs in 2016 and 2017 global logistics and modernization sales increased primarily due 

 33

to higher intercompany volume and increased sales on the ukawacs and hunter programs partially offset by lower volume on the kc10 program as our contract nears completion 

operating income for 2017   decreased   7 million  or 2 percent  primarily due to lower sales as described above operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year 

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

 product sales and costs 

2018   –   product sales for 2018   increased   43 billion  or 25 percent  as compared with 2017  the increase  was   primarily due to the addition of 29 billion  of product sales from innovation systems and higher restricted and f35 volume at aerospace systems 

product costs for 2018   increased   38 billion  or 25 percent  as compared with 2017  consistent with the higher product sales described above 

2017   –   product sales for 2017   increased   15 billion  or 9 percent  as compared with 2016  the increase  was primarily due to higher product sales at aerospace systems and mission systems higher aerospace systems product sales were primarily driven by increased restricted volume partially offset by lower volume on the jwst and nato ags programs the increase at mission systems was principally due to higher product volume on f35 sensors eoir selfprotection programs and the sabr program 

product costs for 2017   increased   14 billion  or 10 percent  as compared with 2016  consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflects lower product margin rates at aerospace systems principally due to changes in contract mix and mission systems 

service sales and costs 

2018   –   service sales for 2018   decreased   238 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2017  the decrease  was   primarily driven by lower service sales at technology services principally due to the completion of several programs partially offset by the addition of 382 million  of service sales from innovation systems 

 34  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

service costs for 2018   decreased   267 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2017  consistent with the lower service sales described above and reflects a higher service margin rate at technology services due to the closeout of a state it outsourcing program 

2017   –   service sales for 2017  were comparable with 2016  higher service sales at aerospace systems on several   autonomous systems and manned aircraft programs were offset by lower service volume principally on the kc10 program at technology services 

service costs for 2017   increased   69 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2016  the increase principally reflects a lower service margin rate at mission systems 

backlog 

backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period it comprises both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

as discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements we adopted asc topic 606 on january 1 2018 using the full retrospective method and applied the transition practical expedient related to backlog for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application however for comparative purposes we have recast our backlog as of december 31 2017 to reflect the impact of adoption of asc topic 606 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2018  and 2017  



approximately 266 billion  of the 535 billion  total backlog at december 31 2018  is expected to be converted into sales in 2019  

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by  operating activities and free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 16 billion  approximately 250 million  was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities commercial paper andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months capital expenditure commitments were 784 million  at december 31 2018  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by  operating activities 



 2018  – net cash provided by  operating activities for 2018   increased  by 12 billion  or 46 percent  as compared with 2017  principally due to higher net earnings which include the addition of innovation systems and improved trade working capital performance 

2017  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2017   decreased  by 200 million  or 7 percent  as compared with 2016  principally due to a 500 million  voluntary pretax pension contribution  325 million  aftertax made in december 2017 

free cash flow 

free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by   operating activities less capital expenditures and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions the payment of dividends and share repurchases this nongaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with  gaap 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by  operating activities to free cash flow 



2018  –  free cash flow for 2018   increased   893 million  or 53 percent  as compared with 2017  the increase was principally driven by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above partially offset by the inclusion of innovation systems’ capital expenditures and higher capital expenditures at aerospace systems 

2017  –  free cash flow for 2017   decreased   208 million  or 11 percent  as compared with 2016  the decrease was principally driven by the 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution discussed above 

investing cash flow 

2018   –   net cash used in investing activities for 2018   increased   to 89 billion   from 889 million   in 2017  the increase was principally due to   77 billion  paid for the acquisition of orbital atk net of cash acquired 

2017   –   net cash used in investing activities for 2017   increased   84 million  or 10 percent  as compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to proceeds from the 2016 sales of a property at aerospace systems and a commercial cyber security business at mission systems partially offset by proceeds from the sale of two investments in 2017 

financing cash flow 

2018   –   net cash used in financing activities during 2018  was 46 billion  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 70 billion  in 2017  the change is principally due to 23 billion  in debt repayments 870 

 36  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

million  higher share repurchases and 320 million  in payments to credit facilities in 2018  compared with 82 billion  net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in 2017  

2017   –   net cash provided by financing activities during 2017  was  70 billion  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  18 billion  in 2016  the change is principally due to 75 billion  higher net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 12 billion  lower share repurchases in 2017 

share repurchases –   see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs 

commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes –   see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commercial paper credit facilities and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements –   see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

other sources of capital –   we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2018  we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest make payments under operating leases settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities payments due under these obligations and commitments and the estimated timing of those payments are as follows 



  

 the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for the company’s pension and opb plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 10  and 12  respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services 

contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost since our contracts typically span a period of several years estimation of revenue cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated risks affecting contract costs performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include changes in or resolution of identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income  see “segment operating results” and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement benefits 

overview  – the determination of projected benefit obligations the fair value of plan assets for our pension and opb plans and pension and opb expense requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions ie actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 431 percent  at december 31 2018  and 368 percent  at december 31 2017  

 38

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2018  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2018  pension and opb obligations which would be reflected in the 2018  mtm expense benefit and 2019  expected pension and opb expense 



cash balance crediting rate  – a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the current 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm benefit expense the cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 30 percent  as of december 31 2018  growing to 325 percent  by 2024  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2018  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2018  pension benefit obligation which would be reflected in the 2018  mtm benefit expense and 2019  expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans however we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable 

during 2018 the investment committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed and approved the plans’ major asset class allocations the current asset allocation is approximately 45 equities 30 fixedincome and 25 alternatives which reflects a shift of approximately 5 from fixedincome to alternatives at this time the investment committee is not contemplating any significant changes to that mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2018 was approximately 109 percent  and our 20year rolling average rate of return was approximately 71 percent  each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses our 2018 actual net plan asset losses were approximately 35 percent  

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

 39  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

for determining 2018  fas expense we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and an expected longterm rate of return on opb plan assets of 765 percent  for 2019  fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and 767 percent  on opb plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2018  eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2019  expected pension and opb expense 



in addition holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2019 mtm expense benefit 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected the soa has issued annual updates to their mortality improvement scale each year since then as additional data has become available these updates generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the original projections from 2014 after considering the additional information released by the soa in october 2018 and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience we continued our practice of adopting the latest soa projection scale but with a longterm improvement rate of 075  versus 10  assumed by the soa accordingly we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31 2018  and the amounts estimated for our 2019  pension and opb expense 

for further information regarding our pension and opb plans see “risk factors” and note 1  and 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes enforcement actions investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters  – we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology

goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date the most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customerrelated intangible assets including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships we determine the fair value of those customerrelated intangible assets based on estimates and judgments including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates and discount rates in some cases we use discounted cash flow analyses which are based on estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance 

impairment testing  – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

we test for impairment of our purchased intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group if such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount we recognize a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

other matters 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than operating leases which largely will be recorded on our balance sheet effective january 1 2019 in connection with our adoption of the new lease standard for additional information on our operating leases see notes 1 and 12  to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of 335 million  at december 31 2018  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm borrowings under our credit facilities for which there was £85 million  the equivalent of approximately 108 million  as of december 31 2018  outstanding at december 31 2018  and on our outstanding shortterm commercial paper borrowings for which there was 198 million  outstanding at december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  we have 144 billion  of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 143 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2018  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 114 million  were outstanding at december 31 2018  a 10  percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance 

commodity price risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to commodity price risk on purchases of inventory such as copper and zinc we enter into forward contracts and purchase orders for the current expected production requirements for smallcaliber ammunition supply contracts we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2018  we had commodity forward contracts outstanding that hedge forecasted commodity purchases of 10 million  pounds of copper and 4 million  pounds of zinc at december 31 2018  a 10 percent unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows

selected financial data and segment operating results 

for a summary of selected consolidated financial information see “selected financial data” for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see “segment operating results” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 85 percent  84 percent  and 83 percent  of sales during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for further information on sales by customer category see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton general dynamics harris l3 technologies leidos leonardo lockheed martin raytheon and 

 3  

northrop grumman corporation 

thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2017  total backlog was 429 billion  as compared with 453 billion  at december 31 2016  for further information see “backlog” in mda 

research and development 

our strategy includes significant investment in research and development rd to support future technologies and mission solutions in 2017 2016 and 2015 we invested 25 percent  29 percent  and 30 percent  of total sales in companysponsored rd for additional information on companysponsored and customerfunded rd see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our approximately 70000  employees approximately 2300  are covered by 10  collective agreements in the us of which we negotiated one  renewal in 2017  and expect to negotiate two  renewals in 2018  see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to employee relations 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

certain classified programs with the us government are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed and are therefore generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report on form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefits costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government regulations and laws to enhance compliance and consistent application for contracts with similar terms 

 4  

northrop grumman corporation 

and conditions in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide generally for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria incentive fees are generally based on cost and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these types of fixedprice incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development lowrate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance 

see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements and “risk factors” 

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2017  recognized by contract type and customer category 



 2   international sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer these sales include foreign military sales contracted through the us government direct sales with governments outside the us and commercial sales outside the us 

environmental 

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment in 2010 we established goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of best management practices for water use and solid waste those goals were achieved as of december 31 2014 in 2015 we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels to reduce potable water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels and to achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate away from landfills 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments see “risk factors” and notes 1  and 12  to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1a  risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 85 percent  84 percent  and 83 percent  of our sales during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we have a number of large programs with the us air force in particular the us government has been implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels the threat environment military strategy and planning andor changes in social economic or political priorities 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination of a contract or contracts for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress and the president or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 the bca by 80 billion split equally between defense and nondefense discretionary spending in fy 2016 and fy 2017 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 

in march 2017 the debt ceiling was reached and the treasury department began taking “extraordinary measures” to finance the government and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling on september 8 2017 the debt ceiling was suspended for three months and on december 9 2017 the treasury department again began taking extraordinary measures to finance the government it is currently estimated that the treasury department will run out of the ability to take extraordinary measures to finance the government in the first half of 2018 if the debt ceiling is not raised and is breached we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is not making timely payments unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach and have significant near and longterm consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry 

in may 2017 the president signed into law the fy 2017 consolidated appropriations act in total for fy 2017 congress appropriated 524 billion in base discretionary funding for the dod consistent with the budget act congress also appropriated approximately 68 billion in overseas contingency operation oco funding and approximately 15 billion in additional dod appropriations 

in may 2017 the president released his fy 2018 budget request which seeks 575 billion for the dod’s base budget approximately 52 billion above the statutory caps provided for in the bca the president’s budget request also seeks an additional 65 billion in oco funding for expeditionary needs not capped by the bca on september 8 2017 the president signed a continuing resolution which generally funded the government at fy 2017 levels through december 8 2017 the continuing resolution was extended to december 22 2017 and further extended to january 19 2018 as congress did not enact appropriations legislation or a new continuing resolution by january 19 2018 on january 20 2018 the us government temporarily shut down on january 22 2018 a fourth continuing resolution was enacted which funds the government through february 8 2018 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes remain significant short and longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the administration and congress what challenges budget reductions required by the bca and otherwise will present for the defense industry and whether an annual appropriations bill will be enacted for fy 2018 if an annual appropriations bill is not timely enacted for fy 2018 or beyond the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets and we may face a government shutdown of unknown duration if a prolonged government shutdown were to occur it could result in program cancellations disruptions

andor stop work orders and could limit our ability to perform on our us government contracts and the us government’s ability to effectively progress programs and to make timely payments 

we believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment would have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the bca other defense spending cuts challenges in the appropriations process the debt ceiling and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions litigation and other legal proceedings particularly those involving governments we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes enforcement actions and administrative civil or criminal litigation or other legal proceedings globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts false claims false statements mischarging contract performance products liability fraud procurement integrity environmental shareholder derivative actions intellectual property tax employees exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety accidents employee benefits and plans including plan administration and improper payments these matters could divert financial and management resources result in administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions which terms include judgments or convictions and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements compensatory treble or other damages nonmonetary relief or actions or other liabilities  and otherwise harm our business government regulations provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute enforcement action or litigation even if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes enforcement actions or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when we experience increased estimated contract costs reasons for increased estimated contract costs may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters

or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than costtype contracts in 2017 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for mature production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss 

our fixedprice contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 

under costtype contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise we also may face additional financial risk due to an increasing number of contract solicitations requiring the contractor to bid on costtype development work and related fixedprice production lots andor options in one submission or costtype development work requiring the contractor to provide certain items to the customer at the contractor’s expense or at little or no fee 

because of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business including our participation in joint ventures is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups taxes environment security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges our customers outside of the us generally have the ability to terminate contracts for default based on performance termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows we also are subject to various nonus procurement and other laws applicable to our industry new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally 

changes in laws regulations political leadership and environment or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national policies and priorities which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment political leadership geopolitical uncertainties government budgets and economic and political factors

more generally any of which could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s exit from the european union the impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business for example the tightening of credit in financial markets outside of the us could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments 

our contracts with nonus customers may also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements they may also require us to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees andor other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations we also increasingly are dependent on incountry suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis we face risks related to our products that are approved for export but may be subject to the us government changing or canceling the export license after the product is ordered our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business 

more broadly our ability effectively to pursue and execute contracts outside the us also may be impacted by our ability to partner successfully with nonus companies including through joint ventures teaming agreements or other arrangements in support of such pursuits this risk includes the ability to identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with local partners as well as potential exposure for their actions 

the products and services we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees subcontractors or other third parties andor increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information false claims procurement integrity cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy or the terms of our contracts however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct despite a vigorous compliance program this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business including our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners and joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions monetary and nonmonetary penalties liabilities and other sanctions including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and 

 10  

northrop grumman corporation 

employees threats to the security of our facilities infrastructure and supply chain and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including our supply chain and joint ventures face similar threats although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel infrastructure or products financial liabilities and damage to our reputation 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business contractual or regulatory actions and potential liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property and perform some of the services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have various impacts on the company including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier including changes in ownership or operations could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform or their inability to perform adequately could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements both domestically and internationally many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers in some cases there may be only one supplier for certain components if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs or is otherwise unavailable we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and contract terms including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable laws and regulations including our customer’s cybersecurity requirements 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

if we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in subcontractor or supplier deliveries of needed materials components services intellectual property or parts if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform if they do not comply with all applicable laws regulations and contract terms or if the certifications we receive from them are inaccurate or if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although often customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts antihuman trafficking specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us or business partners 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be also may affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws and regulations related to our industry including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cas far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the fcpa if we are found to have violated such requirements or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of export privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 12  

northrop grumman corporation 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we are also seeing a significant number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could over time have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas including science technology engineering and math additionally as we grow our international business it is increasingly important that we are able to attract and retain personnel with relevant experience in local laws regulations customs and business practices if qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components or subcontractor performance could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations could negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures 

 13  

northrop grumman corporation 

could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received or replacement obligations 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that also entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed over time compliance with these environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial administrative civil or criminal fines penalties or other sanctions including suspension and debarment for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including class actions relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages determinations on allowability or insurance coverage fines penalties and nonmonetary relief 

we are engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation and other costs related to environmental conditions in bethpage the remediation standards or requirements to which we are subject may change and costs may increase materially the state of new york has notified us that it intends to seek to impose additional remedial requirements and among other things is evaluating natural resource damages we are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes related to remediation andor alleged environmental impacts in bethpage including with federal and state entities local municipalities and water districts insurance carriers and class action plaintiffs these matters could result in fines penalties sanctions compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages determinations on allocation allowability and coverage and nonmonetary relief and actions 

in addition government and private parties could seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 14  

northrop grumman corporation 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes and other damaging storms and natural disasters our business also may be subject to environmental disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant 

natural and environmental disasters could also disrupt our and our subcontractors’ and suppliers’ workforce and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural or environmental disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and products liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of recovery 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services these activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclearrelated incidents to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and to failed launches of spacecraft we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear or launch incident among others whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks 

in addition our customers may otherwise use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky creating potential liabilities to our customers andor our company as the provider of such products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if indemnification or other protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it

could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans defined benefit pension and medical liabilities and related expenses as recorded in our financial statements are primarily dependent upon future investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums for certain of our defined benefit plans and our health and welfare plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and minimum required contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

future investment performance of plan assets and changes in assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 on september 17 2017 the company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire orbital atk the orbital atk acquisition we believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings create value for shareholders provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees and enhance our ability to provide innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements   however in the course of integrating our business with orbital atk’s business we may discover additional information about orbital atk’s business including its financial controls and potential risks opportunities and liabilities that alters our assessment of the anticipated benefits costs and risks of the orbital atk acquisition additionally our customers may not value our combined businesses and capabilities as much as we anticipate in which case we may not realize the benefits of our combined business to the extent we currently anticipate or at all 

the orbital atk acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions some of which are beyond our control and may prevent or otherwise negatively affect the consummation of the orbital atk acquisition or the anticipated benefits therefrom these conditions include the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 and satisfaction of the requirements of the european commission we cannot predict whether or when these conditions will be satisfied or what requirements will be imposed in order to satisfy these conditions in addition the merger agreement may be terminated if the orbital atk acquisition is not completed by september 17 2018 subject to extension to december 17 2018 in certain circumstances and in certain other specified circumstances described in the merger agreement if the orbital atk acquisition is not consummated we will have incurred significant transactionrelated costs expenses and risks without realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the orbital atk acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the orbital atk business with ours the integration of an independent business with our business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process costs may include among other things those associated with facilities and systems consolidation operational impacts severance and other potential employmentrelated costs as well as fees paid to financial legal and other advisors we are devoting and will be required to devote significant management attention and resources prior to the consummation of the orbital atk acquisition to prepare for integration we also will be required to devote significant management attention and resources following the consummation of the orbital atk acquisition effectively to integrate orbital atk’s business and operations with our business and to realize the anticipated benefits one area of integration will be internal controls processes and 

 16  

northrop grumman corporation 

procedures in the past orbital atk restated its financial statements and identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which we will need to address postclosing in the integration process the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively may not result in the realization of the expected benefits of the orbital atk acquisition the consummation of the orbital atk acquisition may trigger change in control and other similar provisions in certain agreements to which orbital atk is a party or otherwise affect contractual relationships which could have an adverse impact on the combined business if we are unable to address such issues successfully the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating orbital atk’s business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the orbital atk acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities 

assuming the orbital atk acquisition closes the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms we may not be able adequately to exploit protect or access intellectual property and the conduct of our customers competitors and suppliers may make it more difficult for us to do so 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and may seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us governments have increased certain efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could reduce our ability to exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments have also declined at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts may require us to access and use third party intellectual property this may require that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement or third party claims or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally in addition our ability to develop innovative and technology advanced products depends in part on continued funding for research and 

 17  

northrop grumman corporation 

development projects our success also depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we are unable to develop new products and technologies or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would negatively impact our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 although we currently have significant excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values goodwill accounts for approximately 36 percent  of our total assets marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability as they did in 2017 upon passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations the interpretation or application thereof or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

overview 

pending acquisition of orbital atk 

on september 17 2017 the company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of orbital atk inc orbital atk for approximately   78 billion   in cash plus the assumption of approximately   14 billion  in net debt the “orbital atk acquisition”  see item 101 in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on september 18 2017 for a summary and copy of the merger agreement we believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings create value for shareholders provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees and enhance our ability to provide innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements   under the terms of the merger agreement orbital atk shareholders are to receive allcash consideration of   13450   per share we expect to fund the orbital atk acquisition with the proceeds from our debt financing completed in october 2017 and cash on hand   see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements   for further information on our orbital atk acquisition financing on november 29 2017 orbital atk shareholders approved the proposed orbital atk acquisition we currently expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2018 after receiving regulatory approvals   upon completion of the orbital atk acquisition we plan to establish orbital atk as a new fourth business sector named northrop grumman innovation systems   

us tax reform 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted the 2017 tax act represents major tax reform legislation that among other provisions reduces the us corporate tax rate certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act including 300 million of tax expense recorded principally due to the writedown of our net deferred tax assets are reflected in our financial results in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which provides sec staff guidance regarding the application of accounting standards codification asc topic 740 income taxes  in the reporting period in which the 2017 tax act became law see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 tax act 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions and diverse regional security concerns global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

the global economic environment also continues to be marked by uncertainty instability and geopolitical tensions global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2018 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility the global economy may also be affected by britain’s exit from the european union the impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions could impact customer purchasing decisions 

us political and economic environment 

the us continues to face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 the bca provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” which took effect in march 2013 

on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raised the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the bca by 80 billion split equally between defense and nondefense discretionary spending in the government’s fy 2016 and fy 2017 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 sequestration spending caps under the bca could reduce defense spending again in fy 2018 

on february 9 2016 the president delivered his fy 2017 budget to congress the fy 2017 budget reflected the fy 2017 spending caps established in the budget act and requested 583 billion for the dod’s annual budget including 59 billion for oco the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016 which was extended in december 2016 and provided funding for the us government at fy 2016 levels through april 28 2017 

in march 2017 the debt ceiling was reached and the treasury department began taking “extraordinary measures” to finance the government and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling on september 8 2017 the debt ceiling was suspended for three months and on december 9 2017 the treasury department again began taking extraordinary 

 24  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

measures to finance the government it is expected that the treasury department will run out of the ability to take extraordinary measures to finance the government in the first half of 2018 

in may 2017 the president signed into law the fy 2017 consolidated appropriations act in total for fy 2017 congress appropriated 524 billion in base discretionary funding for the dod consistent with the budget act congress also appropriated approximately 68 billion in oco funding and approximately 15 billion in additional dod appropriations 

in may 2017 the president released his fy 2018 budget request which seeks 575 billion for the dod’s base budget approximately 52 billion above the statutory caps provided for in the bca the president’s budget request also seeks an additional 65 billion in oco funding for expeditionary needs not capped by the bca on september 8 2017 the president signed a continuing resolution which generally funded the government at fy 2017 levels through december 8 2017 the continuing resolution was extended to december 22 2017 and further extended to january 19 2018 as congress did not enact appropriations legislation or a new continuing resolution by january 19 2018 on january 20 2018 the us government temporarily shut down on january 22 2018 a fourth continuing resolution was enacted which funds the government through february 8 2018 

the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically larger contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts primarily using the costtocost method of percentage of completion accounting but in some cases we utilize the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred and units delivered across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor subcontractor material overhead and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our three segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity changes in margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type andor lifecycle eg costtype fixedprice development production andor sustainment

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

2017  –  sales increased   13 billion  or 5 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems 

2016  – sales increased   982 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems 

see “revenue recognition” in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sales by customer category see “segment operating results” below for further information by segment and “product and service analysis” for product and service detail 

operating income 

2017  – operating income increased   106 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to a 278 million increase in our net fascas pension adjustment and a 24 million  increase in segment operating income partially offset by a 197 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses as described in “segment operating results” higher operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales reduced our operating margin rate to 128 percent  from 130 percent  in the prior year period and was driven by the increase in unallocated corporate expenses and a lower segment operating margin rate as described in “segment operating results” partially offset by the increase in our net fascas pension adjustment 

ga as a percentage of sales decreased  to 103 percent  in 2017  from 105 percent  in 2016  principally due to higher sales volume 

2016  – operating income increased   117 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to a 137 million  reduction in unallocated corporate expenses and higher sales volume partially offset by a 32 million  decrease in our net fascas pension adjustment and lower segment margin rates operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2016  as compared with 2015  which reduced our operating margin rate to 130 percent  from 131 percent  in the prior year period the decrease in operating margin rate was driven by a lower segment operating margin rate and a 32 million  decrease in our net fascas pension adjustment partially offset by a 137 million  reduction in unallocated corporate expenses as described in “segment operating results” 

ga as a percentage of sales decreased  to 105 percent  in 2016  from 109 percent  in 2015  principally due to higher sales volume 

for further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses see “product and service analysis” below 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2017  – our effective tax rate for 2017  was 339 percent  as compared with 247 percent  in 2016   the higher rate is principally due to 300 million  of tax expense recorded in connection with the 2017 tax act largely due to the writedown of net deferred tax assets partially offset by a 69 million  increase in research credits and a 39 million  benefit recognized for additional manufacturing deductions principally related to prior years the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 each include separate approximately 40 million  benefits 

 26  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

recognized in connection with the resolution of internal revenue service irs examinations of the company’s prior year tax returns 

2016  – our effective tax rate for 2016  was 247 percent  as compared with 287 percent  in 2015  the lower rate is principally due to 85 million  of excess tax benefits related to employee sharebased payment transactions recognized in 2016 a 40 million   benefit recognized in connection with resolution of the irs examination of the company’s 20072011 tax returns and a   33 million   benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries  these benefits were partially offset by a 58 million  decrease in research credits which were principally a result of credits recorded in 2015 that were claimed on our prior year tax returns 

net earnings 

2017  – net earnings for 2017   decreased   185 million  or 8 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to the higher effective tax rate discussed above and higher interest expense resulting from our debt issuance in october 2017 as described in note 10  to the consolidated financial statements these decreases were partially offset by higher operating income and an increase in other net as a result of gains on the sale of two investments and higher interest income on shortterm investments 

2016  – net earnings for 2016   increased   210 million  or 11 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to the higher operating income and lower effective tax rate discussed above 

diluted earnings per share 

2017  – diluted earnings per share for 2017   decreased   072  or 6 percent  as compared with 2016  the decrease is primarily due to the 8 percent  decline in net earnings discussed above partially offset by a 3 percent  reduction in weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting principally from shares repurchased during 2016 

2016  – diluted earnings per share for 2016   increased   180  or 17 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase is primarily due to the 11 percent  increase in net earnings discussed above and a 6 percent  reduction in weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased during 2015 and 2016 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

the company is aligned in three operating sectors which also comprise our reportable segments aerospace systems mission systems and technology services for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see “business” 

we present our sectors in the following business areas which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities 

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income section below is a nongaap measure that reflects total earnings from our three segments including allocated pension expense recognized under cas and excluding unallocated corporate items and fas pension expense this measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors this measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap 

2017   segment operating income for 2017   increased   24 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2016  and includes higher operating income at all three sectors the higher operating income includes a 56 million  favorable eac adjustment at aerospace systems on a restricted program largely related to performance incentives and 54 million recognized to date in connection with a claim related to certain costs incurred in prior years the “cost claim” segment operating margin rate decreased  to 115 percent  from 120 percent  in 2016  principally due to lower segment margin rates at aerospace systems and mission systems partially offset by a higher segment margin rate at technology services 

2016   segment operating income for 2016   increased   15 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2015  as a result of higher sales volume which more than offset the lower segment operating margin rate segment operating margin rate decreased  to 120 percent  from 124 percent  in 2015 principally due to a lower segment margin rate at aerospace systems 

reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income  the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of the net fascas pension adjustment as well as unallocated corporate expenses certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or the far see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net fascas pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses 

2017   the increase  in net fascas pension adjustment is primarily due to higher cas expense and lower fas expense than in the prior year period the increase in cas expense relates to the continued phasein of cas harmonization and the impact of actual demographic experience partially offset by a change in our mortality assumption as of december 31 2016 the reduction in fas expense was principally driven by our yearend 2016 fas pension assumptions including the noted change in our mortality assumption offset by a lower discount rate 

2016   the decrease  in net fascas pension adjustment is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns during 2015 partially offset by the increase in our fas discount rate assumption as of december 31 2015  and the continued phasein of cas harmonization 

2017   unallocated corporate expenses increased  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to 47 million  of costs associated with the orbital atk acquisition and 41 million  of deferred state tax expense resulting from state tax adjustments associated with the filing of our prior year federal tax return and the companys 500 million discretionary pension contribution in december 2017 in addition the prior year period included a 35 million   

 28  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

benefit recognized for state tax refunds claimed on our prior year tax returns and a 25 million  benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries 

2016   unallocated corporate expenses declined  in 2016  as compared to 2015  in 2016  unallocated corporate expenses included a 35 million  benefit recognized for state tax refunds claimed on our prior year tax returns and a 25 million  benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries in 2015  unallocated corporate expenses included a 45 million  expense recognized for deferred state income taxes due to a change in accounting methods approved by the irs that lowered our deductions for domestic production activities and a 25 million  expense recognized for deferred state income taxes resulting from a discretionary pension contribution

aerospace systems 

2017   aerospace systems sales for 2017   increased   11 billion  or 10 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher volume on manned aircraft programs manned aircraft sales were driven by higher restricted sales autonomous systems sales increased principally due to higher volume for several programs including triton partially offset by lower nato alliance ground surveillance ags volume space sales increased primarily due to higher restricted sales partially offset by lower volume on the james webb space telescope jwst and advanced extremely high frequency aehf programs 

operating income for 2017   increased   23 million  or 2 percent  primarily due to higher sales partially offset by a lower operating margin rate operating margin rate decreased  to 105 percent  from 114 percent  principally due to changes in contract mix on manned aircraft programs and a gain of 45 million  recognized in the prior year associated with the sale of a property partially offset by the previously discussed 56 million  favorable eac adjustment largely related to performance incentives 

2016   aerospace systems sales for 2016   increased   888 million  or 9 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was due to higher volume on manned aircraft and autonomous systems programs manned aircraft sales increased primarily due to higher restricted volume increased f35 deliveries and production rampup on the e2d program 

 29  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

these increases were partially offset by lower b2 volume and fewer fa18 deliveries autonomous systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the triton and global hawk programs partially offset by rampdown of the nato ags program space sales include higher volume on restricted programs partially offset by lower volume on the aehf program 

operating income for 2016   increased   31 million  or 3 percent  and includes a gain of 45 million  associated with the sale of a property higher sales volume and improved performance on space and autonomous systems programs were more than offset by lower margins on manned aircraft programs principally due to changes in contract mix and the timing of risk reductions operating margin rate decreased  to 114 percent  from 121 percent  primarily due to the lower margins on manned aircraft programs partially offset by improved performance on space and autonomous systems programs 

mission systems 

2017   mission systems sales for 2017   increased   454 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to higher sensors and processing volume partially offset by lower cyber and isr volume sensors and processing sales increased principally due to higher volume on f35 sensors electroopticalinfrared selfprotection and targeting programs communications programs and the scalable agile beam radar program these increases were partially offset by lower volume on international groundbased radar programs cyber and isr sales decreased primarily due to lower volume on isr and restricted programs 

operating income for 2017   increased   8 million  or 1 percent  primarily due to higher sales and 32 million recognized in connection with the cost claim described above partially offset by a lower operating margin rate operating margin rate decreased  to 128 percent  from 132 percent  primarily due to lower margin rates on sensors and processing and cyber and isr programs principally resulting from lower performance and changes in contract mix this decrease was partially offset by improved margin rates at advanced capabilities primarily due to the prior year including a 49 million  forward loss provision on an advanced capabilities program as described below 

2016   mission systems sales for 2016   increased   254 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2015  due to higher volume on sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs partially offset by lower volume on cyber and isr programs sensors and processing sales increased primarily due to higher volume on communications programs including the joint counter radiocontrolled improvised explosive device electronic warfare program increased restricted volume and rampup on the gator program these increases were partially offset by lower volume on international programs advanced capabilities sales increased primarily due to higher volume on restricted maritime systems and marine systems programs cyber and isr sales reflect lower volume on space programs 

operating income for 2016   increased   35 million  or 2 percent  due to the higher sales volume described above and a 21 million  gain associated with the sale of a commercial cyber security product business partially offset by a 49 million  forward loss provision recorded on an advanced capabilities program principally due to cost growth for changes impacting fixedprice options which may not be fully recovered through additional contract value operating margin rate for 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015 and reflects improved performance on sensors and processing programs partially offset by lower margins on advanced capabilities programs 

technology services 

2017   technology services sales for 2017   decreased   75 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2016  primarily due to lower volume on system modernization and services programs partially offset by higher volume on global 

 30  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

logistics and modernization programs system modernization and services sales decreased principally due to the completion of several programs in 2016 and 2017 global logistics and modernization sales increased primarily due to higher intercompany volume and increased sales on the ukawacs and hunter programs partially offset by lower volume on the kc10 program as our contract nears completion 

operating income for 2017   increased   12 million  or 2 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 110 percent  from 106 percent  primarily due to improved performance across the sector 

2016   technology services sales for 2016  were slightly higher than the prior year and reflect higher volume on system modernization and services programs partially offset by lower volume on advanced defense services and global logistics and modernization programs system modernization and services sales increased primarily due to higher volume on us government health programs advanced defense services sales declined primarily due to the completion of several programs in 2015 partially offset by higher volume on the saudi arabian ministry of national guard training support program through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results global logistics and modernization sales decreased principally due to lower volume on the intercontinental ballistic missile program partially offset by higher volume on the kc10 program 

operating income and margin rate for 2016  were comparable to the prior year 

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

 product sales and costs 

2017   product sales for 2017   increased   15 billion  or 9 percent  as compared with 2016  the increase  was primarily due to higher product sales at aerospace systems and mission systems higher aerospace systems product sales were primarily driven by increased restricted volume partially offset by lower volume on the jwst and nato ags programs the increase at mission systems was principally due to higher product volume on f35 sensors eoir selfprotection and targeting programs and the sabr program 

product costs for 2017   increased   14 billion  or 10 percent  as compared to 2016  the increase  principally reflects a lower product margin rate at aerospace systems due to changes in contract mix 

2016   product sales for 2016   increased   877 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase  was primarily driven by higher product sales at aerospace systems due to higher restricted volume increased f35 deliveries and production rampup on the e2d program 

 31  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

product costs for 2016   increased   821 million  or 6 percent  as compared to 2015  consistent with the change in product sales described above 

service sales and costs 

2017   service sales for 2017  were comparable with 2016  higher service sales at aerospace systems on several autonomous systems and manned aircraft programs were offset by lower service volume principally on the kc10 program at technology services 

service costs for 2017  were comparable with 2016  consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflect lower service margins at mission systems partially offset by higher service margins at technology services principally due to improved performance across the sector 

2016   service sales for 2016   increased   271 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase  was primarily driven by higher volume on several cyber and isr and sensors and processing service programs at mission systems 

service costs for 2016   increased   263 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2015  consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflects higher service margins at mission systems partially offset by lower service margins at aerospace systems 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2017  and 2016  



approximately 203 billion  of the 429 billion  total backlog at december 31 2017  is expected to be converted into sales in 2018  

other 

on july 18 2017 the armed services board of contract appeals made public its decision that the government improperly required northrop grumman to treat 253 million of its postretirement benefit costs as unallowable for government contract cost accounting purposes the decision if upheld on any potential appeal would only apply to certain contracts spanning a 20year period 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by  operating activities and free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 112 billion  approximately 200 million  was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months capital expenditure commitments were 492 million  at december 31 2017  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

on september 17 2017 we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire orbital atk for approximately 78 billion  in cash plus the assumption of approximately 14 billion  in net debt in october 2017 the company 

 32  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

issued 825 billion  of unsecured senior notes and intends to use the net proceeds as well as cash on hand to finance the orbital atk acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses see notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by  operating activities 



 2017  – net cash provided by  operating activities for 2017   decreased  by 200 million  or 7 percent  as compared with 2016  principally due to a 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution 325 million aftertax made in december 2017 

2016  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2016   increased  by 651 million  or 30 percent  as compared with 2015  principally due to a 500 million  voluntary pretax pension contribution  325 million  aftertax made in the first quarter of 2015 changes in trade working capital and an increase in net earnings during 2016 partially offset by an increase in net income tax payments 

free cash flow 

free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by   operating activities less capital expenditures and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions stock repurchases and the payment of dividends this measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with  gaap 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by  operating activities to free cash flow 



2017  –  free cash flow for 2017   decreased   208 million  or 11 percent  as compared with 2016  the decrease was principally driven by the 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution discussed above 

2016  –  free cash flow for 2016   increased   202 million  or 12 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was principally driven by the higher net cash provided by operating activities described above partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2016 reflecting 239 million for the purchase of facilities previously leased by mission systems and increased capital investment at aerospace systems 

investing cash flow 

2017   net cash used in investing activities for 2017   increased   84 million  or 10 percent  as compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to proceeds from the 2016 sales of a property at aerospace systems and a commercial cyber security business at mission systems partially offset by proceeds from the sale of two investments in 2017 

 33  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2016   net cash used in investing activities for 2016   increased   374 million  or 87 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was principally due to the higher capital expenditures described above partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a property at aerospace systems and the sale of a commercial cyber security business at mission systems 

financing cash flow 

2017   net cash provided by financing activities during 2017  was 70 billion  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 18 billion  in 2016 the change is principally due to 75 billion higher net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 12 billion lower share repurchases in 2017 

2016   net cash used in financing activities during 2016   decreased   15 billion  or 45 percent  as compared with 2015  principally due to 16 billion lower share repurchases 149 million higher net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 135 million of borrowings under our credit facilities partially offset by 321 million in debt repayments 

share repurchases  see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs 

credit facilities and unsecured senior notes  see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements  see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

other sources of capital  we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2017  we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest make payments under operating leases settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities payments due under these obligations and commitments and the estimated timing of those payments are as follows 



  

 the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 10  and 12  respectively to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services in accounting for these contracts we utilize either the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery method of percentageofcompletion accounting with costtocost being the predominant method 

contract sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to or yet funded by the customer including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees unpriced change orders contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas further as contracts are performed change orders can be a regular occurrence and may be unpriced until negotiated with the customer unpriced change orders contract claims including change orders unapproved as to both scope and price and reas are included in estimated contract sales when management believes it is probable the unpriced change order claim andor rea will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated considering the facts and circumstances known to us at the time 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract operating margin based on estimated contract sales and cost since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated risks affecting contract costs performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include changes in or resolution of identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income  see “segment operating results” and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

new revenue standard 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  using the full retrospective method topic 606 supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance including asc 60535 revenue recognition  constructiontype and productiontype contracts  and outlines a single set of comprehensive principles for recognizing revenue under gaap under topic 606 revenue is recognized as control transfers to the customer as such under the new standard revenue for our contracts is generally recognized over time using the costtocost method which is consistent with the revenue recognition model used for the majority of our contracts prior to the adoption of topic 606 in most cases the accounting for those contracts where we previously recognized revenue as units were delivered has changed under topic 606 such that we now recognize revenue as costs are incurred this change generally results in an acceleration of revenue as 

 35  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

compared with our previous revenue recognition method for those contracts in addition for certain of our contracts there is a change in the number of performance obligations under topic 606 which has altered the timing of revenue and margin recognition see “accounting standards updates” in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of topic 606 

retirement benefits 

overview  – the determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and other postretirement benefit expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 368 percent  at december 31 2017  and 419 percent  at december 31 2016  

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2017  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and 2018  expected pension and other postretirement expense 



cash balance crediting rate   a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate although current 30year treasury bond rates are near historically low levels we expect such bond rates to rise in the future the cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 275 percent  as of december 31 2017  growing to 30 percent  by 2023  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2017  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017  pension benefit obligations and 2018  expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa 

 36  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including historical asset returns the plan’s target asset allocation and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other postretirement benefits however we reduce the eroa for other postretirement benefit plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable 

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2017 was approximately 113 percent  and our 20year rolling average rate of return was approximately 81 percent  each determined on an arithmetic basis our 2017 asset returns net of expenses were approximately 164 percent  

with regard to the company’s investment policy during 2017 the benefit plans investment committee reviewed and reaffirmed the major asset class allocations our asset allocation is approximately 45 equities 35 fixedincome and 20 alternatives and we are not currently contemplating significant changes to that investment mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

for determining fas expense in 2017  and 2016  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  for both 2017 and 2016 and an expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement benefit plan assets of 77 percent  for both 2017 and 2016 for 2018  fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and 77 percent  on other postretirement benefit plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2017  eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2018  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected the soa has issued annual updates to their mortality improvement scale each year since then as additional data has become available these updates generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the original projections from 2014 after considering the additional information released by the soa in october 2017 and after reviewing our own historical mortality experience we continued our practice of adopting the latest soa projection scale but with a longterm improvement rate of 075  versus 10  assumed by the soa accordingly we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and postretirement benefit obligations recognized at december 31 2017  and the amounts estimated for our 2018  pension and postretirement benefit expense

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes enforcement actions investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters   we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology 

for further information on litigation commitments and contingencies see “risk factors” and note 1  note 11  and note 12  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and availableforsale marketable securities with a fair value of 353 million  at december 31 2017  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm borrowings under our credit facilities for which there was £100 million  the equivalent of approximately 134 million  as of december 31 2017  outstanding at december 31 2017  at december 31 2017  we have 153 billion  of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 160 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2017  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 89 million  were outstanding at december 31 2017  a 10  percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 84 percent  83 percent  and 84 percent  of sales during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively for further information on sales by customer category see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton general dynamics harris l3 technologies leidos leonardo lockheed martin raytheon and 

 3  

northrop grumman corporation 

thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2016  total backlog was 453 billion  compared with 359 billion  at the end of 2015  for further information see “backlog” in mda 

research and development 

see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our approximately 67000  employees approximately 2500  are covered by 11  collective agreements in the us of which we negotiated four  renewals in 2016  and expect to negotiate one  renewal in 2017  see “risk factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to employee relations 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

certain classified programs with the us government are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed and are therefore generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this annual report on form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefits costs 

we monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government regulations and laws to enhance compliance and consistent application for contracts with similar terms and conditions in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

 4  

northrop grumman corporation 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide generally for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee as a result costtype contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts costtype contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against contractual criteria and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance incentive fees are generally based on cost and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – firm fixedprice contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer as a result fixedprice contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than costtype contracts certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these types of fixedprice incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on among other things the contract type contract phase eg development low rate production or mature production negotiated fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and cost schedule and technical performance

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2016  recognized by contract type and customer category

environmental 

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment in 2010 we established goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of best management practices for water use and solid waste those goals were achieved as of december 31 2014 in 2015 we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels to reduce potable water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels and to achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate from landfills

 item 1a  risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 84 percent  83 percent  and 84 percent  of our sales during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we have a number of large programs and opportunities with the us air force in particular the us government has been implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels the threat environment military strategy and planning andor changes in social economic or political priorities 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract plus a reasonable fee however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination of a contract or contracts for convenience or reduced future orders 

 6  

northrop grumman corporation 

a significant shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress and the president or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 the budget control act by 80 billion split equally between defense and nondefense discretionary spending in fy 2016 and fy 2017 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 

if the debt ceiling is breached we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach and have significant near and longterm consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry 

on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provided funding for the us government for fy 2016 providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016 which was extended in december 2016 and provides funding for the us government at fy 2016 levels through april 28 2017 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes remain significant longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the incoming administration and congress what challenges budget reductions required by the budget control act and otherwise will present for the defense industry and whether an annual appropriations bill will be enacted for fy 2017 if an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for fy 2017 or beyond the us government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts and we may face a government shutdown of unknown duration adverse consequences from operating under a continuing resolution may be greater as the company has a higher percentage of development programs we believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment would have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the budget control act other defense spending cuts the debt ceiling and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

 7  

northrop grumman corporation 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations longterm funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims disputes and litigation particularly those involving governments we are and may become subject to investigations claims disputes and administrative civil or criminal litigation globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts false claims products liability fraud environmental shareholder derivative actions intellectual property tax exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety employee benefits and plans including plan administration and improper payments these matters could divert financial and management resources result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief and otherwise disrupt our business government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim dispute or litigation even if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims disputes or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business including joint ventures is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings data privacy and protection investment exchange rates and controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups taxes environment security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees affiliates partners or others with whom we work to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges our customers outside of the us generally have the ability to terminate contracts for default based on performance termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows we also are subject to various nonus procurement and other laws applicable to our industry new regulations and requirements or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally 

changes in regulations political leadership and environment or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national policies and priorities which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment geopolitical uncertainties government budgets and economic and political factors more generally any of which could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments we also could be affected by the legal regulatory and economic impacts of britain’s exit from the european union the impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business for example the tightening of credit in financial markets outside of the us could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments 

our contracts with nonus customers may also include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks they may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely

northrop grumman corporation 

affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis we face risks related to our products that are approved for export but may be subject to the us government changing or cancelling the export license after the product is ordered our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business 

the products and services we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts andor developing legal systems this may increase the risk to our employees subcontractors or other third parties andor increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities as well as loss of property or damage to our products 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners or others working on our behalf or with us and this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business including our employees agents subcontractors suppliers business partners and joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding performance due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables incentives awards andor penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ expected performance is also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when we experience increased estimated contract costs reasons for increased estimated contract costs may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of qualified and timely cleared labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more risk than cost type contracts in 2016 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for mature production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a 

 9  

northrop grumman corporation 

loss our fixedpriced contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates under cost type contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in mda 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide software and intellectual property and perform some of the services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier including changes in ownership or operations could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform or their inability to perform adequately could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers in some cases there may be only one supplier for certain components if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs or is otherwise unavailable we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products and components they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers 

if we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in subcontractor or supplier deliveries of needed materials components intellectual property or parts if our subcontractors or suppliers do not comply with all applicable laws and regulations if the certifications we receive from them are inaccurate or if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities infrastructure and supply chain and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including our supply chain and joint ventures face similar threats although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel infrastructure or products financial liabilities and damage to our reputation 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business contractual or regulatory actions and potential liabilities any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although often customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts antihuman trafficking specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us or a business partner 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits for example the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs are being 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor the us government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be also may affect our profitability and predictability 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws related to our industry including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cas far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the fcpa if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of export privileges civil and criminal liabilities the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws regulations and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or financial capacity or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget pressures for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in the us and outside the us from us foreign and multinational firms in some instances outside the us foreign companies may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we are also seeing a significant number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could over time have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition generally or in particular areas or if such personnel are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected

northrop grumman corporation 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities similarly failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations could negatively impact our financial position reputation and ability to win future business 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue schedule and profitability include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our obligations including due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including as they may be changed over time compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be subject to substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions for violations if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

we incur and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment stricter or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws regulations or cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination imposition of fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable rulings on allocation or insurance coverage andor the insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share of such costs could require us to incur significant additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

we also are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties including class actions relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment these matters could result in compensatory or other damages determinations on allowability or insurance coverage fines penalties and nonmonetary relief 

we are engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former united states navy and grumman facilities in bethpage new york we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial remediation costs related to environmental conditions in bethpage we are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes related to remediation andor alleged 

 13  

northrop grumman corporation 

environmental impacts in bethpage including with federal and state entities local municipalities and water districts insurance carriers and class action plaintiffs these matters could result in fines penalties compensatory or other damages including natural resource damages determinations on allocation allowability and coverage and nonmonetary relief 

in addition government and private parties could seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spunoff including our former shipbuilding business andor for which other parties have agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters our business also may be subject to environmental disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant 

natural and environmental disasters could also disrupt our and our subcontractors’ and suppliers’ workforce and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural or environmental disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers including over policy terms reservation of rights the applicability of coverage including exclusions compliance with provisions including notice andor the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of recovery 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and used in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties in addition certain of our products are provided with space launch services these activities subject us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclearrelated incidents to the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials and to failed launches of spacecraft we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear or launch incident among others whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 

 14  

northrop grumman corporation 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain risks 

in addition our customers may otherwise use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky creating potential liabilities to our customers andor our company as the provider of such products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages an incident related to launch activities or an incident or other damages related to or caused by the use of our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or risks and if indemnification or other protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans defined benefit pension and medical liabilities and related expenses as recorded in our financial statements are primarily dependent upon future investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated longterm rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums for certain of our defined benefit plans and our health and welfare plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

future investment performance of plan assets and changes in assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 although we currently have significant excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values goodwill accounts for approximately half of our total assets marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations 

 to perform on our contracts and to win new business we depend on our ability to develop protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms we may not be able adequately to exploit protect or access intellectual property and the conduct of our customers competitors and suppliers may make it more difficult for us to do so 

we own many forms of intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties the us government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

develop in performance of government contracts and may seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property including in competition with us governments have increased certain efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property which could decrease our ability to exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete governments have also declined at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow we typically seek to protect this information including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants and subcontractors these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies in addition our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

in some instances our ability to seek win or perform contracts may require us to access and use third party intellectual property this may require that the government or our customer is willing and able to provide rights to such third party intellectual property or that we are able to negotiate directly to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms 

our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties our use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement or third party claims or to obtain rights to intellectual property of others it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation ability to compete for and perform on contracts financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally our success depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components our success also depends on our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would negatively impact our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability for example a change in the us corporate tax rate would result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets through the income tax provision because our deferred tax assets are measured at the current statutory tax rate in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable law and regulations the interpretation or application thereof changes in the tax rate or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

global security and economic environment 

the us and its allies face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability threats from state and nonstate actors as well as terrorist organizations emerging nuclear tensions and diverse regional security concerns global threats persist across all domains from undersea to space to cyber the market for defense products services and solutions globally continues to be driven by these complex and evolving security challenges considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities 

global economic growth is expected to remain in the low single digits in 2017 reflecting the impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions globally and financial market volatility the global economy may also be affected by britain’s exit from the european union the impact of which is not known at this time global economic conditions could impact customer purchasing decisions 

us political and economic environment 

in the us there is an uncertain political environment with a new administration and a new congress the us continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for its discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” which took effect in march 2013 

on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raised the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act by 80 billion split equally between defense and nondefense discretionary spending in the governments fy 2016 and fy 2017 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 sequestration spending caps under the budget control act could reduce defense spending again in fy 2018 

on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provided funding for the us government for fy 2016 providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 the fy 2016 dod budget was approximately 580 billion including 58 billion for overseas contingency operations oco which represented an approximately four percent increase relative to dod funding for fy 2015 

on february 9 2016 the president delivered his fy 2017 budget to congress the fy 2017 budget reflected the fy 2017 spending caps established in the budget act and requested 583 billion for the dod’s annual budget including 59 billion for oco the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016 which was extended in december 2016 and provides funding for the us government at fy 2016 levels through april 28 2017 

the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular additionally both the incoming administration and the new congress have offered plans to reform the federal income tax code along with other significant policy initiatives some of which could have an impact on the company

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically large contracts or two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts primarily using the costtocost method of percentage of completion accounting but in some cases we utilize the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred and units delivered across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative ga costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach 

 23  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our three segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity changes in margins are generally described in terms of performance and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance generally refers to nonvolume related changes in profitability contract mix refers to changes in the ratio of contract type lifecycle customer or other nonperformance impacts on contract profitability 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

2016  –  sales increased   982 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to higher sales at aerospace systems and mission systems 

2015  – sales decreased   453 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2014  primarily due to lower sales on us government contracts across the company partially offset by an increase in international sales at aerospace systems 

see “revenue recognition” in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sales by customer category 

see “segment operating results” for further information by segment and “product and service analysis” for product and service detail 

operating costs and expenses and operating margin rate 

operating costs and expenses primarily include labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally allocated to contracts as incurred operating margin rate is defined as operating income as a percentage of sales in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs allowable and allocable ga costs including independent research and development ird and bid and proposal costs are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress 

operating costs and expenses comprise the following 

2016  –  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2016  as compared with 2015  which reduced our operating margin rate to 130 percent  from 131 percent  in the prior year period the decrease in 

 24  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating margin rate was driven by lower segment margin rates as described in “segment operating results” and a 32 million  decrease in our net fascas pension adjustment partially offset by a 137 million  reduction in unallocated corporate expenses as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

2015  – operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2015  as compared with 2014  which reduced our operating margin rate to 131 percent  from 133 percent  in the prior year period the decrease in operating margin rate was driven by 179 million  of lower segment operating income as described in “segment operating results” and 21 million  in higher unallocated corporate expenses partially offset by a 79 million  increase in our net fascas pension adjustment as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

2016  – ga as a percentage of sales decreased  to 105 percent  in 2016  from 109 percent  in 2015  principally due to higher sales volume 

2015   – ga as a percentage of sales increased  to 109 percent  in 2015  from 100 percent  in 2014  principally due to an increase in ird as we continue to invest in future business opportunities 

for further information regarding product and service sales and costs see the “product and service analysis” section that follows “segment operating results” 

operating income 

we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses which includes ga 

2016  – operating income increased   117 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to a 137 million  reduction in unallocated corporate expenses and higher sales volume partially offset by a 32 million  decrease in our net fascas pension adjustment and lower segment margin rates 

2015  – operating income decreased   120 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  primarily due to the lower sales volume described above and the absence in 2015 of a 75 million  benefit realized in 2014  in connection with agreements reached with the us government to settle certain claims relating to use of the companys intellectual property and a terminated program 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2016  – our effective tax rate for 2016  was 247 percent  as compared with 287 percent  in 2015  the lower rate is principally due to 85 million   of excess tax benefits related to employee sharebased payment transactions recognized in 2016 resulting from the adoption of asu no 201609 as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements a 40 million   benefit recognized in connection with resolution of the internal revenue service irs examination of the company’s 20072011 tax returns and a   33 million   benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries  described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements these benefits were partially offset by a 58 million  decrease in research credits which were principally a result of credits recorded in 2015 that were claimed on our prior year tax returns while discrete tax benefits in each year have reduced our effective tax rate below the statutory rate these items are not indicative of a longerterm trend on an ongoing basis excluding impacts associated with asu no 201609 and assuming no changes in federal tax legislation we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent due principally to recurring tax benefits associated with the manufacturing deduction and research credits 

2015  – our effective tax rate for 2015  was 287 percent  as compared with 296 percent  in 2014  this reduction was driven by a 76 million  increase in research credits primarily resulting from credits claimed on our prior year tax returns partially offset by a 51 million  benefit recorded in 2014 for the partial resolution of the irs examination of our 20072009 tax returns 

net earnings 

2016  – net earnings for 2016   increased   210 million  or 11 percent  as compared with 2015  primarily due to the higher operating income and lower effective tax rate discussed above 

2015  – net earnings for 2015   decreased   79 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  primarily due to lower operating income and higher interest expense partially offset by the lower effective tax rate described above 

diluted earnings per share 

2016  – diluted earnings per share for 2016   increased   180  or 17 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase is primarily due to the 11 percent  increase in net earnings discussed above and a 6 percent  reduction in weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased during 2015 and 2016 

 25  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2015  – diluted earnings per share for 2015   increased   064  or 7 percent  as compared with 2014  the increase is primarily due to a 10 percent   reduction  in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2014 and 2015 partially offset by the 4 percent  decline in net earnings discussed above 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

at december 31 2016  the company was aligned in three operating sectors which are also our reportable segments aerospace systems mission systems and technology services effective january 1 2016 the company streamlined our sectors from four to three as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see “business” 

we present our sectors in the following business areas which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities 

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below 

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income table below is a nongaap measure that reflects total earnings from our three segments including allocated pension expense recognized under cas and excluding unallocated corporate items and fas pension expense this measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors 

2016   segment operating income for 2016   increased   15 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2015  as a result of higher sales volume which more than offset the lower segment operating margin rate segment operating margin rate decreased  to 120 percent  from 124 percent  in 2015  principally due to a lower segment margin rate at aerospace systems 

2015  segment operating income for 2015   decreased   179 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2014  and segment operating margin rate decreased to 124 percent  from 129 percent  in 2014 the decrease in segment operating income was principally due to lower sales volume and the absence in 2015 of the 75 million in settlements described above and a benefit of approximately 45 million from lower 2014 cas costs due to passage of the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 hatfa the absence in 2015 of the noted settlements and hatfa benefits was the primary driver of the lower 2015 operating margin rate

reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income  the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of net fascas pension adjustments as well as unallocated corporate expenses certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or the far see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the net fascas pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses 

net eac adjustments  we record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion net eac adjustments using the cumulative catchup method of accounting net eac adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below 

net eac adjustments by segment are presented in the table below 

aerospace systems 

2016   aerospace systems sales for 2016   increased   888 million  or 9 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was due to higher volume on manned aircraft and autonomous systems programs manned aircraft sales increased primarily due to higher restricted volume increased f35 deliveries and production rampup on the e2d program these increases were partially offset by lower b2 volume and fewer fa18 deliveries autonomous systems sales increased primarily due to higher volume on the triton and global hawk programs partially offset by rampdown of the nato alliance ground surveillance ags program space sales include higher volume on restricted programs partially offset by lower volume on the advanced extremely high frequency aehf program 

operating income for 2016   increased   31 million  or 3 percent  and includes a gain of 45 million  associated with the sale of a property higher sales volume and improved performance on space and autonomous systems programs 

 27  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

were more than offset by lower margins on manned aircraft programs principally due to changes in contract mix and the timing of risk reductions operating margin rate decreased  to 114 percent  from 121 percent  primarily due to the lower margins on manned aircraft programs partially offset by improved performance on space and autonomous systems programs 

2015   aerospace systems sales for 2015  were comparable to the prior year sales in 2014  included the 75 million in settlements described above excluding the settlements sales for 2015 increased 105 million or 1 percent as compared to 2014 the increase is primarily due to higher volume on autonomous systems and space programs partially offset by lower volume on manned aircraft programs autonomous systems sales reflect higher volume on a number of programs including global hawk partially offset by lower volume on the fire scout and nato ags programs sales in manned aircraft declined principally due to fewer fa18 deliveries as that program ramps down and lower volume on restricted programs partially offset by the transition to full rate production on the e2d program and increased deliveries on the f35 program space sales include higher volume on restricted programs partially offset by lower volume on the aehf program 

operating income for 2015   decreased   80 million  or 6 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 121 percent  from 130 percent  lower operating income and margin rate in 2015 were primarily due to the benefits recognized in 2014 associated with the settlements described above 

mission systems 

2016   mission systems sales for 2016   increased   254 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2015  due to higher volume on sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs partially offset by lower volume on cyber and isr programs sensors and processing sales increased primarily due to higher volume on communications programs including the joint counter radiocontrolled improvised explosive device electronic warfare program increased restricted volume and rampup on the gator program these increases were partially offset by lower volume on international programs advanced capabilities sales increased primarily due to higher volume on restricted maritime systems and marine systems programs cyber and isr sales reflect lower volume on space programs 

operating income for 2016   increased   35 million  or 2 percent  due to the higher sales volume described above and a 21 million  gain associated with the sale of a commercial cyber security product business partially offset by a 49 million  forward loss provision recorded on an advanced capabilities program principally due to cost growth for changes impacting fixedprice options which may not be fully recovered through additional contract value operating margin rate for 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015 and reflects improved performance on sensors and processing programs partially offset by lower margins on advanced capabilities programs 

2015   mission systems sales for 2015   decreased   327 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was due to lower volume across the sector advanced capabilities sales decreased primarily due to the impact of intheater force reductions lower volume on the consolidated afloat network and enterprise services program and completion of the ground combat vehicle contract these decreases were partially offset by higher volume on marine systems and missile defense programs the decrease in cyber and isr sales is primarily due to lower volume on restricted programs partially offset by higher volume on cyber solutions programs sensors and processing sales decreased primarily due to rampdown on an international program and lower volume on the litening program these decreases were partially offset by rampup on the gator program and higher volume on fixed wing avionics and c4isr programs 

operating income for 2015  decreased 147 million  or 9 percent  operating margin rate decreased to 132 percent  from 142 percent  operating income and margin rate for 2015  decreased primarily due to business mix changes which resulted in lower volume for mature fixedprice production programs and higher volume for costtype development programs as well as less favorable performance on sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs 

 28

technology services 

2016   technology services sales for 2016  were slightly higher than the prior year and reflect higher volume on system modernization and services programs partially offset by lower volume on advanced defense services and global logistics and modernization programs system modernization and services sales increased primarily due to higher volume on us government health programs advanced defense services sales declined primarily due to the completion of several programs in 2015 partially offset by higher volume on the saudi arabian ministry of national guard training support program through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results global logistics and modernization sales decreased principally due to lower volume on the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program partially offset by higher volume on the kc10 program the increase in kc10 volume is not indicative of a longerterm trend as we expect kc10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion 

operating income and margin rate for 2016  were comparable to the prior year 

2015   technology services sales for 2015   decreased   83 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease is principally due to lower volume on global logistics and modernization and system modernization and services programs the decrease in global logistics and modernization is mainly due to rampdown activities on the icbm program partially offset by higher volume on intercompany restricted work system modernization and services sales reflect lower volume across a number of programs partially offset by higher volume on the total information processing support services and social security administration it support services programs 

operating income for 2015   increased   53 million  or 11 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 107 percent  from 94 percent  the increase in operating income and margin rate in 2015  reflects improved performance partially offset by the decline in sales volume described above and lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture than in the prior year period 

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 



 29  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

product sales and costs 

2016   product sales for 2016   increased   877 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was primarily driven by higher product sales at aerospace systems due to higher restricted volume increased f35 deliveries and production rampup on the e2d program 

product costs for 2016   increased   821 million  or 6 percent  as compared to 2015  consistent with the change in product sales described above 

2015   product sales for 2015  were comparable with 2014  sales in 2014 included the 75 million in settlements at aerospace systems as described above and sales in 2015 reflect lower product sales at mission systems and higher product sales at technology services the decrease at mission systems was primarily due to rampdown on an international program and lower product sales on certain cyber and isr programs partially offset by higher f35 volume the increase at technology services was primarily due to higher volume on intercompany restricted work 

product costs for 2015   increased   156 million  or 1 percent  as compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to higher product costs at aerospace systems and mission systems due to lower performance and changes in business mix 

service sales and costs 

2016   service sales for 2016   increased   271 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was primarily driven by higher volume on several cyber and isr and sensors and processing service programs at mission systems 

service costs for 2016   increased   263 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2015  consistent with the change in service sales described above and reflects higher service margins at mission systems partially offset by lower service margins at aerospace systems 

2015   service sales for 2015   decreased   358 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was primarily due to lower service sales at mission systems and technology services the decrease at mission systems   was primarily due to lower volume on certain advanced capabilities and unmanned aircraft systems programs including the impact of intheater force reductions the decrease at technology services was primarily due to lower service sales on certain sms programs 

service costs for 2015   decreased   362 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  consistent with the change in service sales described above 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2016  and 2015  



approximately 182 billion  of the 453 billion  total backlog at december 31 2016  is expected to be converted into sales in 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value through cash deployment activities in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by  operating activities and free cash flow a nongaap measure described in more detail below 

 30  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 25 billion  of which 182 million  was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months capital expenditure commitments were 657 million  at december 31 2016  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes the key components of cash flow provided by  operating activities 



 2016  – net cash provided by  operating activities for 2016   increased  by 651 million  or 30 percent  as compared with 2015  principally due to a 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution 325 million aftertax made in the first quarter of 2015 changes in trade working capital and an increase in net earnings during 2016 partially offset by an increase in net income tax payments 

2015  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2015   decreased  by 431 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2014  principally due to changes in trade working capital and a 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution 325 million aftertax made in the first quarter of 2015 partially offset by lower net tax payments 

free cash flow 

free cash flow as reconciled in the table below is a nongaap measure defined as net cash provided by   operating activities less capital expenditures and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for and consideration of acquisitions stock repurchases and the payment of dividends this measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance but should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with  us gaap 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by  operating activities to free cash flow 



2016  –  free cash flow for 2016   increased   202 million  or 12 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was principally driven by the higher net cash provided by operating activities described above partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2016 reflecting 239 million for the purchase of facilities previously leased by mission systems and increased capital investment at aerospace systems 

2015  –  free cash flow for 2015   decreased   341 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was principally driven by the lower net cash provided by operating activities described above partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures 

 31  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

investing cash flow 

2016   net cash used in investing activities for 2016   increased   374 million  or 87 percent  as compared with 2015  the increase was principally due to the higher capital expenditures described above partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a property at aerospace systems and the sale of a commercial cyber security business at mission systems 

2015   net cash used in investing activities for 2015   decreased   214 million  or 33 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was principally due to lower capital expenditures and the 2014 acquisition of qantas defence services pty limited 

financing cash flow 

2016   net cash used in financing activities during 2016   decreased   15 billion  or 45 percent  as compared with 2015  principally due to 16 billion lower share repurchases 149 million higher net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 135 million of borrowings under our credit facilities partially offset by 321 million in debt repayments 

2015   net cash used in financing activities during 2015  was comparable with the prior year period and reflects an increase in share repurchases and dividends offset by 600 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2015  

credit facilities and unsecured senior notes  in december 2016 the company issued 750 million  of unsecured senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to fund redemption of 200 million  of the companys existing debt we expect to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including potential pension plan funding and working capital   see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements  see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

other sources of capital  we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

share repurchases  see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our share repurchase programs 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2016  we had contractual commitments to repay debt with interest make payments under operating leases settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and make payments on various other liabilities payments due under these obligations and commitments and the estimated timing of those payments are as follows

the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended erisa for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 9  and 11  respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services in accounting for these contracts we utilize either the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery method of percentageofcompletion accounting with costtocost being the predominant method 

contract sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to or yet funded by the customer including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees unpriced change orders contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment reas further as contracts are performed change orders can be a regular occurrence and may be unpriced until negotiated with the customer unpriced change orders contract claims including change orders unapproved as to both scope and price and reas are included in estimated contract sales when management believes it is probable the unpriced change order claim andor rea will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated based on the facts and circumstances known to us at the time 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract operating margin based on estimated contract sales and cost since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include our historical performance the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated risks affecting contract costs performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and ga costs and changes in estimated award and incentive fees identified risks typically include technical schedule andor performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include identified opportunities for operating margin improvement

retirement benefits 

overview  – the determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are

northrop grumman corporation 

  

warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and other postretirement benefit expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and mortality rate of those covered by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 419 percent  at december 31 2016  and 453 percent  at december 31 2015  

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2016  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2016  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and 2017  expected pension and other postretirement expense 



cash balance crediting rate   a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate although current 30year treasury bond rates are near historically low levels we expect such bond rates to rise in the future the cash balance crediting rate assumption has therefore been set to its current level of 31 percent  as of december 31 2016  growing to 36 percent  by 2022  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2016  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2016  pension benefit obligations and 2017  expected pension expense

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets eroa assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments eroa is a longterm assumption which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our longterm view of expected market returns andor significant changes in our plan asset investment policy due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including historical asset returns the plan’s target asset allocation and third party projection models of expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to the data points themselves we consider trends in the data points including changes from the prior measurement date the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other postretirement benefits however we reduce the eroa for other postretirement benefit plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trusts are taxable 

while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix investment managers and active asset management we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2016 is 111 percent  and our 20year rolling average rate of return is 82 percent  each determined on an arithmetic basis our 2016 asset returns were approximately 77 percent  

with regard to the companys investment policy during 2016 the benefit plans investment committee reviewed and reaffirmed the major asset class allocations our asset allocation is approximately 45 equities 35 fixedincome and 20 alternatives and we are not currently contemplating significant changes to that investment mix for further information on plan asset investments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

consistent with our past practice we obtained longterm capital market forecasting models from several third parties and using our target asset allocation developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models but also changes in the models yeartoyear when developing our eroa 

for determining fas expense in 2016  and 2015  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  for both 2016 and 2015 and an expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement benefit plan assets of 77 percent  and 76 percent  respectively for 2017  fas expense we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and 77 percent  on other postretirement benefit plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2016  eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2017  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity hedge funds and opportunistic investments estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected in october 2015 the soa issued an updated mortality improvement scale which further refined the previous scale based on additional data and which generally contained lower mortality improvement projections in october 2016 the soa issued another updated mortality improvement scale which generally contained lower mortality improvement projections than the prior scales in consideration of this information we studied our historical mortality experience and developed an expectation for continued future mortality improvements based on the most recent soa table but with a longterm improvement rate of 075  versus 10  assumed by the soa based on this data we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and postretirement benefit obligations recognized at december 31 2016  and the amounts estimated for our 2017  pension and postretirement benefit expense

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims disputes investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect managements assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters   we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations their interpretation or application contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities and improvements in remediation technology

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and availableforsale marketable securities with a fair value of 330 million  at december 31 2016  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm borrowings under our credit facilities for which there was £110 million  the equivalent of approximately 135 million  as of december 31 2016  outstanding at december 31 2016  at december 31 2016  we have 71 billion  of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 76 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in certain circumstances we are exposed to foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2016  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 147 million  were outstanding at december 31 2016  a 10  percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

customer concentration 

our largest customer is the us government sales to the us government accounted for 83 percent 84 percent and 86 percent of sales during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively for further information on sales by customer category see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total sales during any period presented see risk factors in part i item 1a 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton finmeccanica general dynamics harris l3 communications leidos lockheed martin raytheon and thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2015  total backlog was 359 billion  compared with 382 billion  at the end of 2014  for further information see backlog in part ii item 7 

research and development

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see risk factors in part i item 1a 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see risk factors in part i item 1a 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our approximately 65000  employees approximately 2600  are covered by 12  collective agreements in the us of which we negotiated renewals of four  in 2015  and expect to negotiate renewals of five  in 2016  see risk factors in part i item 1a 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed are generally referred to as “restricted” in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated financial statements and

financial information in this annual report on form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the far and cas include but are not limited to lobbying costs certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefits costs 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee award fee andor incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against contractual criteria and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these types of fixedprice incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2015  recognized by contract type and customer 



 2  sales to international and other customers include foreign military sales contracted through the us government direct commercial sales with governments outside the us sales to state and local governments and sales to commercial customers 

profit margins may vary materially depending on among other things negotiated contract fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is determined 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with applicable government regulations and laws in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency

environmental 

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in 2010 we established goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of best management practices for water use and solid waste those goals were achieved as of december 31 2014 in 2015 we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels to reduce potable water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels and achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate from landfills 

we have recorded liabilities and have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments see risk factors in part i item 1a and notes 1  and 11  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived 83 percent 84 percent and 86 percent of our sales during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the us government has been implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels military strategy and planning andor changes in socialpolitical priorities 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our ability to compete for other contracts 

 7  

northrop grumman corporation 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget sequestration the appropriations process use of continuing resolutions with restrictions eg on new starts and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

on november 2 2015 the president signed the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 the budget control act by 80 billion split equally between defense and domestic spending over the next two years 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 however unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach which could negatively affect the us governments timely payment of our billings resulting in delayed cash collection and have significant consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provides funding for the us government for fy 2016 providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes remain significant longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold what challenges budget reductions required by the budget control act and otherwise will present for the defense industry and whether an annual appropriations bill will be enacted for fy 2017 if an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for fy 2017 or beyond the us government may operate under a continuing resolution restricting new contract or program starts and we may face a government shutdown of unknown duration adverse consequences from operating under a continuing resolution may be greater if the company has a higher percentage of development programs we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

long term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the department of defense dod and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the budget control act other defense spending cuts and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

 8  

northrop grumman corporation 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations long term funding under a continuing resolution an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown andor future budget and program decisions among other items may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims and litigation particularly those involving governments we are and may become subject to investigations claims and administrative civil or criminal litigation globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts false claims products liability fraud environmental intellectual property tax exportimport anticorruption labor health and safety employee benefits and plans including plan administration and improper payments these matters could divert financial and management resources result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief and otherwise disrupt our business government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business including joint ventures is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings data privacy and protection investment exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment works councils and other labor groups taxes security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges 

changes in regulations political leadership and environment or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national policies and priorities government budgets and economic factors more generally any of which could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing or payment decisions by customers global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our international business our international contracts may also include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements our ability to sell products outside the us could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products for export on a cost effective basis or to obtain all necessary export licenses and authorizations on a timely basis our ability to conduct business outside of the us also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills andor security clearances in the markets in which we do business 

the products and services we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors and joint ventures in which we have an interest are sometimes in countries with unstable governments andor developing legal systems in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of political dynamics or an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties or in loss of property or damage to our products it also exposes the company to additional financial contractual and legal risks accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could also result in negative publicity which could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts

northrop grumman corporation 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have implemented extensive policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors or others working on our behalf or with us and this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures improper actions by our employees agents subcontractors business partners or joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when we experience increased estimated contract costs reasons for estimated contract cost growth may include design issues changes in estimates of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues or requests to perform additional work at the direction of the customer production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters we may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more risk than cost type contracts in 2015 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience such as for mature production programs in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss our fixedpriced contracts may include fixedprice development work this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed price development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates under cost type contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates and the failure to prevail on claims for equitable adjustments could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers and partners including subcontractors and joint ventures face similar threats although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel infrastructure or products andor damage to our reputation as well as our partners ability to perform on our contracts 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential personal or otherwise protected information ours or that of our employees customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business regulatory actions and potential liability any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans pension and medical liabilities and related expenses in our financial statements that have been recorded in connection with these plans are primarily dependent upon future investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions including discount rates applied to future payment obligations mortality assumptions estimated long term rates of return on plan assets rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

in accordance with government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

future investment performance of plan assets and changes in assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide intellectual property and perform some of the services we 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer in some cases there may be only one supplier for certain components if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs or is otherwise unavailable we may be unable to find a suitable alternative 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit unauthorized or otherwise noncompliant parts or materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding the parts or materials we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance 

if we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in supplier deliveries of needed materials components intellectual property or parts if our subcontractors or suppliers do not comply with all applicable laws and regulations if the certifications we receive from them are inaccurate or if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing or marketing capabilities in some areas or financial capacity or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of budget reductions for many customers a continued focus on affordability and competition and our own success in winning business we are facing increasing competition in our us and international markets from us foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we also are seeing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in protests we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could over time have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to limits on recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

 12  

northrop grumman corporation 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices globally as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs in the us including compensation costs have been significantly reduced the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor 

we again including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cas far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the fcpa if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of export privileges the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

if we do not comply with the laws regulations and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters our business also may be subject to environmental disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant 

natural and environmental disasters could also disrupt our and our subcontractors’ and suppliers’ workforce and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural or environmental disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers over policy terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of cash flows and if litigation over coverage terms with the insurer becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may adversely affect us

northrop grumman corporation 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if available insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations among other such operations our products and services are used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and in support of nuclearrelated operations of third parties this subjects us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclearrelated incidents and the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from such nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain nuclearrelated risks 

in addition our customers may otherwise use our products and services in connection with hazardous activities or in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky creating potential liabilities to our customers andor our company as the provider of such products and services in the event of an incident if our customers fail to use our products properly or if our products or services do not operate as intended we could be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities 

if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages or incident or other damages related to or caused by the hazardous use of our products and services and if indemnification or other protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 goodwill accounts for approximately half of our total assets marketbased inputs to the calculations in our goodwill impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions additionally the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors particularly the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers in the us and internationally our success depends on our continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components our success also depends on our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would negatively impact our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances globally if qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if we experience a high level of attrition for geographic compensationrelated or other reasons or if such personnel 

 14  

northrop grumman corporation 

are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees failure to maintain a qualified workforce would result in significant difficulty in performing under our contracts 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies or attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be adversely affected 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions inability to manage effectively a broad array of programs manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our performance obligations due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have an adverse impact on our current and future business 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be required to incur additional costs in excess of those anticipated as a result of among other things new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts or sanctions or penalties or a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable in addition if other identified responsible parties are insolvent or otherwise unable to pay their share of such costs we may be required to incur additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations these laws and regulations may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property typically for government purposes more recently we believe the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by these laws and foreign courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to control or protect our intellectual property rights against claims by our customers or others or otherwise procure necessary intellectual property it could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable us or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability for example a change in the us corporate tax rate would result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets through the income tax provision because our deferred tax assets are measured at the current statutory tax rate in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable law and regulations the interpretation or application thereof changes in the tax rate or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 in connection with the spinoff transaction we entered into a number of agreements with hii setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation for example under the separation and distribution agreement from and after the spinoff transaction each of hii and northrop grumman is generally responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spinoff it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and hii and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to hii for example tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if hii were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations 

in addition third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which hii has agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have under our agreements with hii may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities even if we ultimately succeed in 

 16  

northrop grumman corporation 

recovering from hii or the us government any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid in addition certain indemnities that we may be required to provide hii are not subject to a cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the spinoff transaction we received a letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution except that our shareholders who received cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash nevertheless if the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution were ultimately determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

us political and economic environment 

the us government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for its discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” which took effect in march 2013 

in december 2013 congress passed the national defense authorization act ndaa congress also passed and the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which set discretionary spending levels for fiscal year fy 2014 and fy 2015 the legislation provided for additional budget funding of approximately 63 billion over fy 2014 and fy 2015 the additional funding alleviated some budget cuts that would otherwise have been instituted through sequestration in fy 2014 and fy 2015 

in december 2014 congress passed and the president signed into law the consolidated and further appropriations act of 2015 providing for federal spending levels for fy 2015 consistent with the bipartisan budget act of 2013 

on november 2 2015 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the budget act the budget act raises the debt ceiling until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act by 80 billion split equally between defense and nondefense spending over the next two years 50 billion in fy 2016 and 30 billion in fy 2017 

on december 18 2015 congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provides funding for the us government for fy 2016 providing 11 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016 the fy 2016 dod budget approved by congress is approximately 581 billion including 58 billion for overseas contingency operations oco which represents an approximately four percent increase relative to the dod funding for fy 2015 

the federal budget continues to be the subject of considerable debate which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular 

for further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment see risk factors in part i item 1a 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically two or more closelyrelated contracts we recognize sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts primarily using the costtocost method of percentage of completion accounting but in some cases we utilize the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts as such we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion below of results of operations first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance generally refers to changes in estimatesatcompletion eacs for contract operating margin rates during the period net eac adjustments as well as the continuing effect of prior net eac adjustments

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

2015  –  sales decreased   453 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2014  primarily due to lower sales on us government contracts at aerospace systems and information systems partially offset by an increase in international sales at aerospace systems 

2014  – sales decreased   682 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2013  primarily due to lower sales on us government contracts partially offset by an increase in international sales across the company 

see “revenue recognition” in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for further information on sales by customer category 

see segment operating results below for further information by segment and the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results for product and service detail 

operating costs and expenses 

operating costs and expenses primarily comprise labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally allocated to contracts as incurred in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs allowable and allocable general and administrative costs including independent research and development ird and certain bid and proposal costs are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress   

operating costs and expenses comprise the following 

2015  –  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2015  as compared with 2014  which reduced our operating margin rate to 131 percent from 133 percent in the prior year period the increase in operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by 179 million of lower segment operating income as described in the segment operating results section below and 21 million in higher unallocated corporate expenses partially offset by a 79 million increase in our net fas gaap financial accounting standardscas pension adjustment for further information regarding net fascas pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8  

2014  – operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales declined in 2014  as compared with 2013  which increased our operating margin rate to 133 percent from 127 percent in the prior year period the reduction in 

 24  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by a 101 million increase in our net fascas pension adjustment and 19 million of higher segment operating income partially offset by 50 million in higher unallocated corporate expenses 

2015  – general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased  to 109 percent  in 2015  from 100 percent  in 2014  principally due to an increase in ird as we continue to invest in future business opportunities 

2014   – general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased  to 100 percent  in 2014  from 91 percent  in 2013  principally due to an increase in ird as we continue to invest in future business opportunities 

for further information regarding product and service sales and costs see the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results 

operating income and margin rate 

we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses which includes general and administrative expenses operating margin rate is defined as operating income as a percentage of sales 

2015  – operating income decreased   120 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014 and operating margin rate decreased to 131 percent  from 133 percent  in 2014 primarily due to the lower sales volume described above and the absence in 2015 of a 75 million benefit realized in 2014 in connection with agreements reached with the us government to settle certain claims relating to use of the companys intellectual property and a terminated program 

2014  – operating income increased   73 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2013 and operating margin rate increased to 133 percent  from 127 percent  in 2013 primarily due to a 101 million increase in our net fascas pension adjustment and higher operating income at aerospace systems due to the settlements described above partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expenses and lower operating margin rates at electronic systems 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2015  – our effective tax rate for 2015  was 287 percent  as compared with 296 percent  in 2014  this reduction was driven by a 76 million  increase in research credits primarily resulting from additional credits claimed on our prior year tax returns partially offset by a 51 million  benefit recorded in 2014 for the partial resolution of the  internal revenue service irs examination of our 20072009 tax returns 

2014  – our effective tax rate for 2014  was 296 percent  as compared with 318 percent  in 2013  the decline in the companys lower effective tax rate for 2014 reflects a 51 million  benefit for the partial resolution of our 20072009 irs examination 

net earnings 

2015  – net earnings for 2015   decreased   79 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  primarily due to lower operating income and higher interest expense partially offset by the lower effective tax rate described above 

2014  – net earnings for 2014   increased   117 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  primarily due to higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by higher interest expense 

diluted earnings per share 

2015  – diluted earnings per share for 2015   increased   064  or 7 percent  as compared with 2014  the increase is primarily due to a 10 percent reduction in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2014 and 2015 partially offset by the 4 percent  decline in net earnings discussed above 

2014  – diluted earnings per share for 2014   increased   140  or 17 percent  as compared with 2013  the increase is primarily due to a 9 percent reduction in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2013 and 2014 and the 6 percent  increase in net earnings discussed above

at december 31 2015 the company was aligned in four segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems and technical services for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services and for further information see business in part i item 1 

this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates a reconciliation of segment sales to total sales is provided in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 a reconciliation of

segment operating income to total operating income as well as a discussion of the reconciling items is provided in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for purposes of the discussion in this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate 

segment operating income and margin rate 

segment operating income as reconciled in the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income table below is a nongaap measure and is used by management as an internal measure for financial performance of our operating segments segment operating income reflects total earnings from our four segments including allocated pension expense recognized under cas and excludes unallocated corporate items including fas pension expense 



2015   segment operating income for 2015   decreased   179 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2014  and segment operating margin rate decreased  to 124 percent  from 129 percent  in 2014  the decrease in segment operating income was principally due to lower sales volume and the absence in 2015 of the 75 million in settlements described above and a benefit of approximately 45 million  from lower 2014  cas costs due to passage of the highway and transportation funding act of 2014  hatfa the absence in 2015 of the noted settlements and hatfa benefits was the primary driver of the lower 2015 operating margin rate 

2014   segment operating income for 2014   increased   19 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2013  and segment operating margin rate increased  to 129 percent  from 125 percent  in 2013 the increase in segment operating income and margin rate was principally due to the benefits recognized as a result of the settlements and the hatfa legislation described above these increases more than offset the impact of lower sales volume 

net eac adjustments  we record changes in estimated contract operating margin at completion net eac adjustments using the cumulative catchup method of accounting in aggregate net eac adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and are presented in the table below

2015   aerospace systems sales for 2015  were comparable to the prior year sales in 2014 included the 75 million in settlements described above excluding the settlements sales for 2015 increased 82 million or 1 percent as compared to 2014 the increase in unmanned systems ums sales reflects higher volume on a number of programs including global hawk these increases were partially offset by lower volume on the fire scout and nato alliance ground surveillance ags programs military aircraft systems mas sales increased principally due to the transition to full rate production on the e2d advanced hawkeye program increased deliveries on the f35 program and higher volume on the joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars program these increases were partially offset by lower volume on the fa18 program due to fewer deliveries as the program ramps down space sales include higher volume on restricted programs partially offset by lower volume on the advanced extremely high frequency aehf program 

operating income for 2015   decreased   95 million  or 7 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 122 percent  from 132 percent  lower operating income and margin rate in 2015 were primarily due to the benefits recognized in 2014 associated with the settlements described above 

2014   aerospace systems sales for 2014  were comparable to 2013  and include the impact of the settlements described in the segment operating income and margin rate section above excluding the settlements aerospace systems had lower sales on ums space and mas programs the decrease in ums programs reflects declines of 136 million  on global hawk due to lower production activity and 111 million  on fire scout as a result of lower development activity these declines were partially offset by 135 million  of higher volume on the nato ags program the decrease in space programs was mainly due to lower volume on the james webb space telescope and aehf programs the decrease in mas programs was primarily the result of lower volume on the jstars f35 and b2 programs partially offset by higher volume of 87 million  on the e2d advanced hawkeye program 

operating income for 2014   increased   100 million  or 8 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 132 percent  from 121 percent  higher operating income and margin rate in 2014  were primarily due to the settlements described above and improved performance

electronic systems 



2015   electronic systems sales for 2015   decreased   109 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume on airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance  targeting aisrt systems and land  self protection systems lsps partially offset by higher volume on navigation  maritime systems nms programs aisrt sales decreased primarily due to lower volume on the litening program the decline in lsps is due to intheater force reductions and rampdown on an international program partially offset by increased deliveries on infrared countermeasures ircm programs and rampup on the gator program the increase in nms sales reflects higher volume from rampup activities on a number of marine and undersea systems programs 

operating income for 2015   decreased   80 million  or 7 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 156 percent  from 165 percent  operating income and margin rate for 2015 decreased primarily due to business mix changes which resulted in lower volume for mature fixed price production programs and higher volume for costtype development programs and less favorable performance on aisrt and lsps programs 

2014   electronic systems sales for 2014   decreased   198 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2013  lower sales are principally due to lower volume for lsps programs including lower deliveries of 174 million  on ircm and laser systems lower volume for us intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and targeting programs including 93 million  of lower deliveries on combat avionics and 109 million  of lower volume for nms programs the declines were partially offset by higher sales of 178 million  on international programs 

operating income for 2014   decreased   78 million  or 6 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 165 percent  from 171 percent  operating income and margin rate for 2014  declined primarily due to a reduction in net eac adjustments lower volume and the absence in 2014  of the benefit from the reversal of a 26 million  nonprogrammatic risk reserve in 2013  

information systems 



2015   information systems sales for 2015   decreased   328 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease is primarily driven by lower volume on command and control c2 and civil programs the decrease in c2 is mainly driven by lower volume on the consolidated afloat network and enterprise services program the impact of intheater force reductions and completion of the ground combat vehicle contract the decrease in civil is primarily due to the restructuring of the emergency communications transformation program stage ii contract 

operating income for 2015   increased   5 million  or 1 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 105 percent  from 98 percent  the increase in operating income and margin rate reflects improved performance partially offset by the decline in sales volume described above 

2014   information systems sales for 2014   decreased   374 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  sales principally declined as a result of lower volume of 294 million on c2 programs and 62 million on communications programs due to intheater force reductions reduced funding levels and the winddown of various programs 

operating income for 2014   decreased   22 million  or 3 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 98 percent  from 96 percent  the lower operating income is primarily a result of the lower sales described above the higher operating margin rate reflects additional operating income resulting from improved performance

technical services 



2015   technical services sales for 2015   increased   39 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2014  the increase was principally due to higher volume on mission solutions and readiness msr programs partially offset by lower volume on integrated logistics and modernization ilm programs the increase in msr was primarily due to higher volume on the saudi arabian ministry of national guard training support program through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results the decrease in ilm was mainly due to rampdown activities on the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program partially offset by increased volume on the jstars and hunter programs 

operating income for 2015   decreased   7 million  or 3 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 89 percent  from 93 percent  the declines in both operating income and operating margin rate were principally due to lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture than in the prior year period 

2014   technical services sales for 2014   decreased   44 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume on the icbm hunter and combined tactical training range programs which were partially offset by growth in international sales principally as a result of the acquisition of qantas defence services pty limited qds in the first quarter of 2014  

operating income and margin rate for 2014  were comparable to 2013  

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment

northrop grumman corporation 

  

product sales and product costs 

2015   product sales for 2015  were comparable with 2014  sales in 2014 included the 75 million in settlements at aerospace systems as described above and sales in 2015 reflect lower product sales at information systems and higher product sales at technical services the decrease at information systems was primarily due to lower product sales on certain cyber programs partially offset by higher f35 volume the increase at technical services was primarily due to higher volume on intercompany restricted work 

product costs for 2015   increased   174 million  or 1 percent  as compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to higher product costs at aerospace systems and electronic systems due to lower performance and changes in business mix these increases were partially offset by a reduction in product costs at information systems due to lower sales and improved performance 

2014   product sales for 2014  were slightly higher than 2013  primarily due to higher product sales at information systems offset by lower product sales at aerospace systems the increase at information systems was primarily due to higher product sales on certain restricted and c2 programs the decrease at aerospace systems was primarily driven by lower product volume in unmanned and space programs partially offset by the settlements described in the segment operating results section above 

product costs for 2014  were slightly higher than 2013  primarily due to higher product costs at information systems offset by lower product costs at aerospace systems consistent with the changes in product sales described above 

service sales and service costs 

2015   service sales for 2015   decreased   389 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was primarily due to lower service sales at information systems and electronic systems the decrease at information systems was primarily due to lower volume on c2 and civil programs including the impact of intheater force reductions the decrease at electronic systems was primarily due to lower service sales on certain tactical sensor and other programs 

service costs for 2015   decreased   388 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2014  consistent with the change in service sales described above 

2014   service sales for 2014   decreased   686 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily driven by lower service sales at information systems principally from reduced volume on restricted work and the impacts of intheater force reductions as described in the segment operating results section above 

service costs for 2014   decreased   673 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  consistent with the change in service sales described above 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2015  and 2014  



the percentage of total backlog from the us government international and other customers at december 31 2015 totaled 81 percent  16 percent  and 3 percent  respectively

new awards 

2015   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2015  was 213 billion  significant new awards during 2015  include 18 billion  for the f35 program 11 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 947 million  for the saudi arabian ministry of national guard training support program through our interest in a joint venture for which we consolidate the financial results 597 million  for the b2 program and 504 million  for the fa18 program 

on october 27 2015 the us air force announced it was awarding us a contract for engineering and 

manufacturing development and early production for the long range strike bomber lrsb in november 2015 the unsuccessful offeror filed a protest asking the us government accountability office gao to review the decision to award the company the lrsb contract triggering an automatic stay of performance of the contract  as a result the lrsb award is not included in 2015 new awards or backlog 

2014   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2014  was 250 billion  significant new awards during 2014  include 41 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 14 billion  for the global hawk program 13 billion  for the f35 program 727 million  for the b2 program and 560 million  for the virginia class submarine program 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by operating activities free cash flow and net debttoequity and net debttocapital ratios we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance and condition 

cash balances and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months 

operating cash flow 

the table below summarizes the key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



 2015  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2015   decreased  by 431 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2014  principally due to changes in trade working capital and a 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution made in march 2015 partially offset by lower net tax payments 

2014  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2014   increased  by 110 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2013  principally due to a 500 million voluntary pretax pension contribution made in april 2013  partially offset by changes in trade working capital during 2014  

as of december 31 2015  the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was 551 million  we intend to permanently reinvest these balances and expect future us cash generation will be sufficient to meet future us cash needs capital expenditure commitments were 393 million  at december 31 2015  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

 31  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to consider as it represents cash flow the company has available after capital spending to invest for future growth strengthen the balance sheet andor return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases free cash flow is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2015  –  free cash flow for 2015   decreased   341 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was principally driven by the lower net cash provided by operating activities described above partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures 

2014  –  free cash flow for 2014   decreased   87 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was principally driven by higher capital expenditures associated with our aerospace systems centers of excellence partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities as described above 

investing cash flow 

2015   cash used in investing activities for 2015   decreased   214 million  or 33 percent  as compared with 2014  the decrease was principally due to lower capital expenditures and the 2014 acquisition of qds 

2014   cash used in investing activities for 2014   increased   299 million  or 86 percent  as compared with 2013  the increase was principally due to higher capital expenditures associated with our aerospace systems’ centers of excellence as well as the acquisition of qds 

financing cash flow 

2015   net cash used in financing activities during 2015 was comparable with the prior year period and reflects an increase in share repurchases and dividends offset by 600 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2015 

2014   cash used in financing activities for 2014   increased   24 billion  or 281 percent  as compared with 2013  the increase was primarily due to the absence in 2014 of 28 billion of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes of which 850 million was used for the redemption of existing debt in 2013 as well as increased share repurchases in 2014  

credit facility and unsecured senior notes  see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for further information on our credit facility and unsecured senior notes 

financial arrangements  see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for further information on our use of standby letters of credit and guarantees 

 32  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

other sources of capital  we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

share repurchases  in october 2015 the company completed its previously announced goal of repurchasing 60 million shares of common stock by the end of 2015 see note 2  of the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for further information on our share repurchase programs 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  and the estimated timing of future cash payments 



  

 the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended erisa for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 9  and 11  respectively to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services in accounting for these contracts we utilize either the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery method of percentageofcompletion accounting with costtocost being the predominant method 

sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment amounts pertaining to cost andor performance incentives are included in estimated contract sales when they are reasonably estimable 

 33  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract operating margin based on estimated contract sales and cost since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials components and subcontracts the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated risks affecting contract costs performance issues with our subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and general and administrative expenses and changes in estimated award and incentive fees eacs are also adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance these risks typically include technical schedule and performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income loss see the consolidating operating results section above and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

retirement benefits 

overview  – the determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of several actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of these assumptions in consultation with our outside actuaries as we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and other postretirement benefit expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and mortality rate of those covered by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year we determine the discount rate using a portfolio of bonds matching the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage composite pension discount rate was 453 percent  at december 31 2015  and 412 percent  at december 31 2014  

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2015  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2015  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and 2016  expected pension and other postretirement expense 



 34  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

cash balance crediting rate   a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate although current 30year treasury bond rates are near historically low levels we expect such bond rates to rise in the future the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 30 percent  as of december 31 2015  growing to 375 percent  by 2021  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2015  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2015  pension benefit obligations and 2016  expected pension expense 



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested through consultation with our investment management team and outside investment advisers management develops expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to our historical investment performance we consider several factors including current market data such as yieldspriceearnings ratios historical market returns over long periods and periodic surveys of investment managers’ expectations using policy target allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns we calculate a weightedaverage expected return 

the assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other postretirement benefits the longterm rate of return on plan assets used for medical and life benefits is reduced to allow for the impact of tax on expected returns as the earnings of certain voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trusts are taxable unlike the pension trust 

for 2015  and 2014  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and assumed an expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement benefit plan assets of 758 percent  and 745 percent  respectively for 2016  we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent  on pension plans and 770 percent  on other postretirement benefit plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2015  expected longterm rate of return on plan asset assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2016  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale which reflect longer life expectancies than previously projected in october 2015 the soa issued an updated mortality improvement scale which further refined the previous scale based on additional data and which generally contained lower mortality improvement projections in consideration of this information we studied our historical mortality experience and developed an expectation for continued future mortality improvements based on this data we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and postretirement benefit obligations recognized at december 31 2015  and the amounts estimated for our 2016  pension and postretirement benefit expense

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and counsel we determine whether to record a reserve and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and if so of what amount reflect managements assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters   we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions discovery of more or less extensive or different contamination than anticipated information regarding the potential causes of contamination results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements or other obligations and improvements in remediation technology 

for further information on litigation commitments and contingencies see risk factors in part i item 1a and note 1  note 10  and note 11  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired during an interim period such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as to determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model we use industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach 

impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and availableforsale marketable securities with a fair value of 310 million  at december 31 2015  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2015  at december 31 2015  we have 65 billion  of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 69 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to our international operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2015  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 141 million  were outstanding at december 31 2015 a 10  percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal markets bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton finmeccanica general dynamics l3 communications lockheed martin raytheon and thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

at december 31 2014  total backlog was 382 billion  compared with 370 billion  at the end of 2013  of the backlog at december 31 2014  approximately 193 billion  is expected to be converted into sales in 2015  for further information see backlog in part ii item 7 

research and development 

see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8  

intellectual property 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide we also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes see risk factors in part i item 1a 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials see risk factors in part i item 1a 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our 64300  employees of which approximately 2800  are covered by 14  collective agreements we negotiated renewals of two  of our collective agreements in 2014  and expect to negotiate renewals of five  of our collective agreements in 2015  see risk factors in part i item 1a 

regulatory matters 

government contract security restrictions 

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed are generally referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and us government cost accounting standards cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to lobbying costs certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefit costs 

 5  

northrop grumman corporation 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee award fee and incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs award and incentive fees are based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against negotiated criteria and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a ceiling amount typically through a costsharing ratio that affects profitability these types of fixedprice incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare ceiling is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and risk factors in part i item 1a 

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2014  recognized by contract type and customer 



 profit margins may vary materially depending on among other things negotiated contract fee arrangements achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is determined 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with applicable government regulations and laws in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

environmental 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in 2010 we established goals for the reduction of water use and solid waste through implementation of best management practices those goals were achieved as of december 31 2014 in addition after achieving the greenhouse gas ghg reduction goals established by the company in 2009 we announced in 2014 our commitment to reduce ghg emissions by 2020 from our 2010 ghg emissions level 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments see risk factors in part i item 1a note 1  and note 11  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived approximately 85 percent  of our total sales during each of the past several years the us government is implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels military strategy and planning andor changes in socialpolitical priorities 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in the event of a stop work order contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government they could also ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders 

a significant shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are 

 7  

northrop grumman corporation 

committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable plans adopted by the us government along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget sequestration the appropriations process and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor 

the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling was suspended until march 15 2015 if the existing debt ceiling is not raised we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments an extended debt ceiling breach could negatively affect the us governments timely payment of our billings resulting in delayed cash collection and have significant consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes remain significant longterm risks considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base members of congress continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm implications for our company and the entire defense industry 

long term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the department of defense dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the budget control act other defense spending cuts and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations an extended debt ceiling breach andor future budget and program decisions may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations claims and litigation particularly those involving governments we are and may become subject to investigations claims and administrative civil or criminal litigation globally and across a broad array of matters including but not limited to government contracts false claims products liability fraud environmental intellectual property tax exportimport labor health and safety employee benefits and improper payments these matters could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations an investigation claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future investigations claims or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

 8  

northrop grumman corporation 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings data privacy and protection investment exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment taxes security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges 

changes in regulations political leadership and environment or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct business in international markets our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets as well as global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements 

the services and products we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors are sometimes in countries with unstable governments andor developing legal systems in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of political dynamics or an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties or in loss of property or damage to our products it also exposes the company to additional financial contractual and legal risks accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could also result in negative publicity which could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts 

the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have implemented extensive policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents subcontractors or others working on our behalf or with us and this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally in addition in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures some of which we do not control we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures improper actions by our employees agents business partners or joint ventures could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

our operating income can be adversely affected when we experience increased contract costs reasons for contract cost growth may include design issues the nature and complexity of the work to be performed including technical or quality issues production challenges including those resulting from the availability and timeliness of customer funding unavailability or reduced productivity of labor or the effect of any delays in performance the availability performance quality or financial strength of significant subcontractors supplier issues including the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components the effect of any changes in laws or regulations actions deemed necessary for longterm customer satisfaction and natural disasters or environmental matters

northrop grumman corporation 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently tend to have more risk than cost type contracts in 2014 approximately half of our sales were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our fixedprice contracts this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates under cost type contracts allowable costs incurred by the contractor are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks insider threats threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression our customers suppliers and subcontractors face similar threats although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel infrastructure or products andor damage to our reputation as well as our or our suppliers’ or subcontractors’ ability to perform on our contracts 

cyber threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software destructive malware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information ours or that of our customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems in addition we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation require remedial actions and lead to loss of business regulatory actions potential liability and other financial losses 

we provide cyber and information technology systems products and services to various customers government and commercial who also face cyber threats our systems products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter threats or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities harm to individuals or property damage to our reputation loss of business regulatory actions and potential liability any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations mortality assumptions rates of future cost growth 

 10  

northrop grumman corporation 

and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

recently the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our fas gaap financial accounting standards pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2014 which will have a related impact on our annual fas benefit expense in future years we also updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our future cas benefit expense we expect the adoption of new mortality assumptions for purposes of funding our plans will likely trail the adoption for both fas and cas purposes the new mortality assumptions may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

additionally due to government regulations including the impact of cas harmonization pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

changes in estimates and assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide intellectual property and perform some of the services we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers 

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer in some cases there may be only one supplier for certain components if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs we may be unable to find a suitable alternative consistent with the industry’s efforts our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit or unauthorized parts or materials in some circumstances we must rely on certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding the parts or materials we procure 

if certifications received from our subcontractors or suppliers are inaccurate if we are unable to procure or experience significant delays in supply deliveries of needed materials components intellectual property or parts or if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or specialized engineering manufacturing marketing capabilities or financial capacity or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies and our customer’s continued focus on affordability and competition we are facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from us foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor 

we also are seeing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or prevail in a protest we may experience declines in future revenues and market share which could over time have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 us government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and other requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to limits on recovery of employee compensation costs counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate with significant financial impact in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced others are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified all with potentially significant financial costs to the company in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor 

we also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cas far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the fcpa if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the withholding of payments from our customer the loss of export privileges the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

if we do not comply with the laws regulations and processes to which we are subject or if business practices change significantly including with respect to the thresholds for allowable costs it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters our business also may be subject to environmental disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a 

 12  

northrop grumman corporation 

contract although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant 

natural and environmental disasters could also disrupt our and our subcontractors’ and suppliers’ workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural or environmental disaster it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us disputes with insurance carriers over policy terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of cash flows and if litigation over coverage terms with the insurer becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may adversely affect us 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

if available insurance coverage customer indemnifications andor other legal protections are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we provide products and services used in nuclearrelated activities including nuclearpowered platforms and support nuclearrelated operations of third parties this subjects us to various extraordinary risks including potential liabilities relating to nuclearrelated incidents and the harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from such nuclearrelated activities operations or incidents as well as the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not the cause was within our control under some circumstances the us government and prime contractors provide for certain indemnification and other protection under certain of our government related contracts including pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act for certain nuclearrelated risks if there was a nuclear incident or other nuclearrelated damages and that indemnification or other protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 goodwill accounts for approximately half of our total assets marketbased inputs to the calculations in the impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could change significantly from our current assumptions additionally the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors particularly the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andor results of operations

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services and market these products and services to our customers our success also depends on our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would negatively impact our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain in our industry for geographic compensationrelated or other reasons we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees failure to maintain a qualified workforce would result in significant difficulty in performing under our contracts 

certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our programs served by employees who are covered by such agreements or representation 

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies or attract and retain a qualified workforce we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be adversely affected 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery or system failures as a result of issues with respect to design technology intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft loss of aviation platforms premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with design quality and workmanship country of origin of procured materials delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues human factors unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected 

if we are unable to meet our performance obligations due to issues regarding the design development or manufacture of our products or services or we experience launch platform or satellite system failures it could have an adverse impact on our current and future business 

 14  

northrop grumman corporation 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs we may be required to incur additional costs in excess of those anticipated as a result of among other things new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts or sanctions or penalties or a determination that certain environmental costs are unallowable in addition if other identified responsible parties are insolvent or otherwise unable to pay their share of such costs we may be required to incur additional costs in excess of those anticipated 

environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations these laws and regulations may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency epa on a list maintained by the general services administration of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on us government contracts until the violation is corrected 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property typically for government purposes more recently we believe the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by these laws and foreign courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

if we are unable adequately to control or protect our intellectual property rights against claims by the us government or others or otherwise procure necessary intellectual property it could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our tax expense and profitability for example a change in the us corporate tax rate would 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets through the income tax provision because our deferred tax assets are measured at the current statutory tax rate in addition the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities whether due to changes in applicable law and regulations the interpretation or application thereof changes in the tax rate or a final determination of tax audits or litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 in connection with the spinoff transaction we entered into a number of agreements with hii setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation for example under the separation and distribution agreement from and after the spinoff transaction each of hii and northrop grumman is generally responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spinoff it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and hii and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to hii for example tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if hii were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations 

in addition third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which hii has agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have under our agreements with hii may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hii or the us government any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid in addition certain indemnities that we may be required to provide hii are not subject to a cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the spinoff transaction we received a letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution except that our shareholders who received cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash nevertheless if the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution were ultimately determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

overview 

political and economic environment 

the us government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for its discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” which took effect in march 2013 

in december 2013 congress passed the national defense authorization act ndaa congress also passed and the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which set discretionary spending levels for fiscal year fy 2014 and fy 2015 the legislation provided for additional budget funding of approximately 63 billion over fy 2014 and fy 2015 the additional funding alleviated some budget cuts that would otherwise have been instituted through sequestration in fy 2014 and fy 2015 

in february 2014 the president signed into law the temporary debt limit extension act suspending the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march 15 2015   if the existing debt ceiling is not raised we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments an extended debt ceiling breach could negatively affect the us governments timely payment of our billings resulting in delayed cash collection and have significant consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry 

in march 2014 the dod released its quadrennial defense review qdr a congressionallymandated report that discusses the dod’s longterm strategies and priorities the qdr recommends spending above the sequester levels and identifies potential impacts if sequester caps are imposed again in 2016 in july 2014 the national defense panel a bipartisan group of senior civilians and military officers appointed by congress to review the qdr recommended repealing the 2011 budget control act and returning to higher defense funding levels it is unclear whether or how the results of these strategic reviews could impact future budget plans 

in december 2014 congress passed and the president signed into law the consolidated and further appropriations act of 2015 providing for federal spending levels for fy 2015 consistent with the bipartisan budget act of 2013 

the administration is currently preparing its fy 2016 budget request which is expected to be submitted to congress in the first calendar quarter of 2015 congressional authorization and appropriation of defense and other spending for fy 2016 and beyond including whether by appropriations bills or continuing resolutions and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule congress and the administration also continue to debate the debt ceiling among other fiscal issues as they negotiate plans for longterm national fiscal policy the outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base members of congress continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on our company and the entire defense industry 

we believe spending on recapitalization modernization and maintenance of defense intelligence and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing individual systems and provide realtime integration of surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms we expect significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike missile defense command and control network communications enhanced situational awareness satellite systems restricted programs cyber technical services and information technology as well as numerous homeland security programs 

the company believes it has additional international opportunities direct and foreign military sales beyond those realized today to sell its products and services outside the us market particularly in the domains of unmanned systems cyber c4isr logistics and manned military aircraft the administration has been addressing and supporting export control reforms that could enhance our ability to take advantage of these opportunities the

company is dedicating additional resources to expanding its international sales with emphases on australia the middle east asia and europe to the extent these efforts are successful increases in international awards sales profits and cash flows may offset or partially offset potential declines resulting from the us political and economic environment described above

operating performance assessment 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs typically two or more closelyrelated contracts sales from our portfolio of longterm contracts are primarily recognized using the costtocost method of percentage of completion accounting but in some cases the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting is utilized as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our us government business and related cost accounting standards cas most types of costs are allocable to us government contracts and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion below of results of operations first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance generally refers to changes in contract operating margin rates for the period as well as the continuing effect of prior cumulative catchup adjustments both are primarily related to the changes in estimates referred to above 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 



sales 

sales for 2014   decreased   682 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2013  sales for 2013   decreased   557 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2012

the table below shows the variances in segment sales from the respective prior years 



for further information by segment refer to segment operating results below and for product and service detail refer to the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results 

operating costs and expenses 

operating costs and expenses primarily comprise labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally allocated to contracts as incurred in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs allowable and allocable general and administrative costs are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress 

operating costs and expenses comprise the following 

2014  –  product costs as a percentage of product sales for 2014  were 744 percent  as compared to 757 percent   during 2013  the decrease  is mainly due to the settlements described in the segment operating results section below and the continuing benefit of higher margin rates resulting from previous net favorable adjustments service costs as a percentage of service sales for 2014  were 798 percent  as compared to 815 percent  during 2013  the decrease  was mainly due to improved performance across a number of service programs at information systems and the continuing benefit of higher margin rates resulting from previous net favorable adjustments at aerospace systems 

2013  – product costs as a percentage of product sales for 2013  were 757 percent  as compared to 753 percent  during 2012  the increase  is primarily due to lower product operating margins in newly awarded programs at information systems service costs as a percentage of service sales for 2013  were 815 percent  as compared to 810 percent  during 2012  the increase  is primarily due to lower service operating margins at aerospace systems and information systems 

for further information regarding product and service sales and costs see the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results 

2014 – general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased  to 100 percent  in 2014  from 91 percent  in 2013  the increase largely reflects increased investment for future business 

2013   – general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales decreased  to 91 percent  in 2013  from 97 percent  in 2012  the decrease reflects lower indirect costs principally related to cost reduction initiatives at information systems as well as lower bid and proposal expenses

operating income 

we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses which includes general and administrative expenses changes in estimated contract operating margin at completion resulting from changes in estimated sales operating costs and expenses are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting which in aggregate can have a significant effect on our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods cumulative catchup adjustments are presented in the table below 



net cumulative catchup adjustments by segment are presented in the table below 



federal and foreign income taxes 

2014  – our effective tax rate for 2014  was 296 percent  as compared with 318 percent  in 2013  the companys lower  e ffective tax rate for 2014 reflects a 51 million  benefit for the partial resolution of its 20072009 internal revenue service irs examination 

2013  – our effective tax rate for 2013  was 318 percent  as compared with 333 percent  in 2012  the companys lower effective tax rate for 2013  includes a 37 million  benefit for the american taxpayer relief act enacted in january 2013 which reinstated research tax credits for 2012 and 2013 and a 21 million  benefit for higher section 199 manufacturing deductions than in prior year 

net earnings 

2014  – net earnings for 2014   increased  by 117 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  the higher earnings are primarily due to an increase in net fas gaap financial accounting standardscas pension adjustment and the lower effective tax rate described above which were partially offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses for further information regarding net fascas pension adjustment and unallocated corporate expenses see the segment operating results section 

2013  – net earnings for 2013   decreased   26 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2012  the lower earnings reflect lower segment operating income partially offset by the lower effective tax rate described above for further information regarding segment operating income see the segment operating results section 

diluted earnings per share 

2014  – diluted earnings per share for 2014   increased  by 140  or 17 percent  as compared with 2013  the increase reflects lower weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2013 and 2014 and the higher net earnings discussed above 

2013  – diluted earnings per share for 2013   increased  by 054  or 7 percent  as compared with 2012  the increase principally reflects lower weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from shares repurchased in 2012 and 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2014  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2014   increased  by 110 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2013  principally due to a 500 million  voluntary pretax pension contribution made in april 2013  partially offset by changes in trade working capital during 2014 

 26  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2013  – net cash provided by operating activities for 2013   decreased  by 157 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  principally due to higher voluntary pension contributions in 2013  partially offset by changes in trade working capital in 2013  we contributed 579 million  to our pension plans of which 500 million  was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 367 million  in 2012  of which 300 million  was voluntarily prefunded 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned in four segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems and technical services this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates the reconciliation of segment sales to total sales is provided in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income as well as discussion of the reconciling items is provided in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for purposes of the discussion in this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate 

in 2014 the company acquired qantas defence services pty limited qds now called northrop grumman integrated defence services pty limited northrop grumman ids for a final purchase price of 85 million  in cash northrop grumman ids provides integrated logistics sustainment and modernization support primarily to australian government and military customers the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of northrop grumman ids are included in the technical services segment these amounts were not material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see the business descriptions in part i item 1 

segment operating income 

segment operating income as reconciled below is a nongaap measure and is used by management as an internal measure of financial performance for our operating segments segment operating income reflects total earnings from our four segments including allocated pension expense recognized under cas and excludes unallocated corporate items including fas pension expense 



2014   segment operating income for 2014   increased  by 19 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2013  the increase in segment operating income was principally due to a 75 million benefit realized in connection with agreements reached with the us government to settle certain claims relating to use of the companys intellectual property and a terminated program and a segment operating margin benefit of approximately 45 million  as a result of lower 2014 cas costs due to the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 hatfa legislation described below which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume 

2013   segment operating income for 2013   decreased  by 96 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease in segment operating income was principally due to lower sales the decrease in operating margin rate reflects lower net favorable adjustments in 2013  partially offset by higher contract margin rates across our portfolio resulting from several factors including the continuing effect of prior net favorable adjustments 

 27  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income by including the impact of net fascas pension adjustments as well as certain corporatelevel expenses which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or far 



net fascas pension adjustment 

for financial statement purposes we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with gaap under fas however the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with the far and the related cas that govern such plans the net fascas pension adjustment reflects the difference of pension expense charged to contracts and included as cost in segment operating income less pension expense determined in accordance with gaap 

2014  the increase in net fascas pension adjustment is principally due to a reduction in fas expense largely due to the increase in our fas discount rate assumptions as of december 31 2013 the reduction in fas expense was partially offset by lower cas expense due to the passage of hatfa which included provisions that reduce the amount of cas expense charged to our contracts   

2013  the increase in net fascas pension adjustment   reflects an update for actual demographic experience as of january 1 2013 which resulted in an increase to the companys 2013 cas expense   

unallocated corporate expenses 

unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses other than fas pension costs not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules and therefore not allocated to the segments such as a portion of management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses 

2014  the increase in unallocated corporate expense for 2014  as compared to 2013  is primarily due to increases in yearoveryear provisions for environmental matters 

2013   the decrease in unallocated corporate expenses for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to lower yearoveryear provisions for disallowed costs and litigation matters and the favorable settlement of overhead claims partially offset by changes in deferred tax assets due to lower blended state income tax rates 

aerospace systems 



2014   aerospace systems sales for 2014  were comparable to 2013  and include the impact of the settlements described in the segment operating income section above excluding the settlements aerospace systems had lower sales in unmanned space and manned military aircraft programs the decrease in unmanned programs reflects declines of 136 million  on global hawk due to lower production activity and 111 million  on fire scout as a result of lower development activity these declines were partially offset by 135 million  of higher volume on the nato alliance ground surveillance ags program the decrease in space programs was mainly due to lower volume on the james webb space telescope jwst and advanced extremely high frequency aehf programs the decrease in manned military aircraft programs was primarily the result of lower volume on the joint surveillance 

 28  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

target attack radar system f35 and b2 programs partially offset by higher volume of 87 million  on the e2d advanced hawkeye program 

operating income for 2014   increased   100 million  or 8 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 132 percent  from 121 percent  higher operating income and margin rate in 2014  were primarily due to the settlements described above and improved performance 

2013   aerospace systems sales for 2013  were slightly higher than 2012  due to higher volume on manned military aircraft programs offset by lower volume on unmanned and space programs the increase in manned military aircraft programs reflects higher sales of 107 million  from increased deliveries on the f35 program as well as higher volume on the b2 and e2d advanced hawkeye programs partially offset by lower volume on various other programs the decrease for unmanned programs reflects lower sales of 295 million  on the global hawk program largely due to rampdown on sustainment support and logistics contracts partially offset by higher sales of 187 million  on the nato ags program resulting from rampup activities the decrease in space programs reflects lower volume for restricted programs due to rampdown activities and higher volume on the jwst and aehf programs 

operating income and operating margin rate for 2013  were comparable to 2012  operating income and operating margin rate also reflect the impact of a forward loss recognized on a restricted program which was offset by the continuing effect of higher contract margin rates across the segment principally related to prior net favorable adjustments 

electronic systems 



2014   electronic systems sales for 2014   decreased   198 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2013  lower sales are principally due to lower volume for land and selfprotection programs including lower deliveries of 174 million  on infrared countermeasures and laser systems lower volume for domestic intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and targeting programs including 93 million  of lower deliveries on combat avionics and 109 million  of lower volume for navigation and maritime programs the declines were partially offset by higher sales of 178 million  on international programs 

operating income for 2014   decreased   78 million  or 6 percent  and operating margin rate decreased  to 165 percent  from 171 percent  operating income and margin rate for 2014  declined primarily due to a reduction in net favorable adjustments lower volume and the absence in 2014  of the benefit from the reversal of a 26 million  nonprogrammatic risk reserve in 2013 

2013   electronic systems sales for 2013   increased   199 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  the increase was due to higher sales on international programs of 244 million  and space programs partially offset by lower sales on navigation and maritime systems programs of 132 million  due to decreased deliveries as well as lower volume on laser systems programs associated with intheater force reductions 

operating income for 2013   increased   39 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  consistent with the higher sales volume described above operating margin rate was comparable with 2012  and reflects higher margin rates on our current portfolio of programs a reduction in net favorable adjustments and the reversal of a 26 million  nonprogrammatic risk reserve 

 29  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

information systems 



2014   information systems sales for 2014   decreased   374 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  sales principally declined as a result of lower volume of 294 million  on c2 programs and 62 million  on communications programs due to intheater force reductions reduced funding levels and the winddown of various programs 

operating income for 2014   decreased   22 million  or 3 percent  and operating margin rate increased  to 98 percent  from 96 percent  the lower operating income is primarily a result of the lower sales described above the higher operating margin rate reflects additional operating income resulting from improved performance 

2013   information systems sales for 2013   decreased   760 million  or 10 percent  as compared with 2012  the sales decline includes a 98 million  impact for the transfer of intercompany efforts to our corporate shared services organization excluding the transfer 2013  sales declined 9 percent due to lower funding levels including the impacts of sequestration and lower volume for programs impacted by intheater force reductions and contract completions 

operating income for 2013   decreased   128 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2012  operating margin rate decreased to 96 percent  in 2013  from 103 percent  in 2012  lower operating income and operating margin rate were primarily due to the lower sales volume described above and a 73 million  reduction in net favorable adjustments compared with the prior year 

technical services 



2014   technical services sales for 2014   decreased   44 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume on the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm hunter and combined tactical training range programs which were partially offset by growth in international sales principally as a result of the acquisition of qds in the first quarter of 2014  

operating income and margin rate for 2014  were comparable to 2013  

2013   technical services sales for 2013   decreased   176 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of 127 million  on the icbm and integrated logistics and modernization programs as well as portfolio shaping efforts 

operating income for 2013   decreased   6 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2012  operating margin rate increased to 92 percent  in 2013  from 89 percent  in 2012  lower operating income was driven by the lower sales volume described above partially offset by higher operating margin rate primarily due to improved performance across a number of programs

product and service analysis 

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

 product sales and product costs 

2014   product sales for 2014  were slightly higher than 2013  primarily due to higher product sales at information systems offset by lower product sales at aerospace systems the increase at information systems was primarily due to higher product sales on certain restricted and c2 programs the decrease at aerospace systems was primarily driven by lower product volume in unmanned and space programs partially offset by the settlements described in the segment operating results section above 

product costs for 2014  were slightly higher than 2013  primarily due to higher product costs at information systems offset by lower product costs at aerospace systems consistent with the changes in product sales described above 

2013   product sales for 2013  were comparable with 2012  primarily due to lower product sales at aerospace systems offset by higher product sales at information systems and electronic systems the decrease at aerospace systems reflects the revision in the classification of certain operations maintenance and sustainment contracts from product to service in 2013  the increase at information systems was primarily due to newly awarded product contracts and the increase at electronic systems was primarily driven by higher volume as described in the segment operating results section above 

product costs for 2013  were comparable with 2012  primarily due to lower product costs at aerospace systems offset by higher product costs at information systems and electronic systems the decrease at aerospace systems was consistent with the classification change noted above the decrease was offset by newly awarded product contracts at information systems and higher sales volume at electronic systems as described above 

service sales and service costs 

2014   service sales for 2014   decreased   686 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily driven by lower service sales at information systems principally from reduced volume on restricted work and the impacts of intheater force reductions as described in the segment operating results section above 

service costs for 2014   decreased   673 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2013  consistent with the change in service sales described above 

 31  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2013   service sales for 2013   decreased   688 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  primarily due to lower service sales at information systems partially offset by higher service sales at aerospace systems the decrease at information systems is due to lower service sales across a number of programs as described in the segment operating results section above the higher service sales at aerospace systems reflects the revision in the classification of certain contracts from product to service as described above and higher volume on certain military aircraft service contracts in 2013  

service costs for 2013   decreased   553 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2012  primarily due to lower service volume at information systems partially offset by higher service sales at aerospace systems consistent with the change in service sales described above 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2014  and 2013  



approximately 193 billion  of the 382 billion  total backlog at december 31 2014  is expected to be converted into sales in 2015  us government orders comprised 82 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2014  international orders including foreign military sales accounted for 14 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2014  domestic commercial backlog represented 4 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2014  

new awards 

2014   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2014  was 250 billion  significant new awards during 2014  include 41 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 14 billion  for the global hawk program 13 billion  for the f35 program 727 million  for the b2 program and 560 million  for the virginia class submarine program 

2013   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2013  was 219 billion  on a net basis awards during 2013  totaled 209 billion  reflecting 1 billion  of adjustments during the first half of the year to reduce information systems unfunded backlog principally associated with expired periods of performance on active contracts including several previously awarded task orders on idiq contracts significant new awards in 2013  include 22 billion  for the f35 program 13 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 866 million  for the aehf program 694 million  for the b2 program and 632 million  for the triton program 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including cash provided by operating activities free cash flow net debttoequity and net debttocapital we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance and condition 

during the second quarter of 2013 the companys board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 40 billion  of the company’s common stock 2013 repurchase program at the same time the company announced its plan to repurchase shares with the goal of retiring approximately 25 percent of its then outstanding shares 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting as of december 31 2014  we had repurchased 422 million  shares towards that goal additionally during the fourth quarter of 2014 the companys 

 32  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional 30 billion  of the company’s common stock 2014 repurchase program by its terms repurchases under the 2014 repurchase program will commence upon completion of the 2013 repurchase program 

cash balances and cash generated from operating activities supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months as of december 31 2014  the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was 537 million  we currently do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations capital expenditure commitments were 533 million  at december 31 2014  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

the table below summarizes the key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



 free cash flow   

free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to consider as it represents the cash flow the company has available after capital spending to invest for future growth strengthen the balance sheet andor return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases free cash flow is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions the payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2014  –  free cash flow for 2014   decreased   87 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2013  the decrease was principally driven by higher capital expenditures due to a ramp up of investments in our aerospace systems centers of excellence partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities as described in the consolidated operating results section above we currently expect capital expenditures to continue to increase in 2015 

2013  –  free cash flow for 2013   decreased   190 million  or 8 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease was principally driven by higher voluntary pension contributions in 2013  we contributed 579 million  to our pension plans during 2013  as compared with 367 million  in 2012  

credit facilities 

the company maintains an unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1775 billion  the credit agreement the credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions including covenants restricting the companys ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake 

 33  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

other fundamental changes and incur liens the company also cannot permit the ratio of its debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreement to exceed   65 percent  at december 31 2014  the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement   and there was   no   balance outstanding under this facility 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital  – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

financial arrangements  – see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  and the estimated timing of future cash payments 



  

 the table above also excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act as amended erisa for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 9  and 11  respectively to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services in accounting for these contracts we utilize either the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery method of percentageofcompletion accounting with costtocost being the predominant method

contract sales may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment amounts pertaining to cost andor performance incentives are included in estimated contract sales when they are reasonably estimable 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineers program managers and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment we prepare estimatesatcompletion eacs for our contracts which include an estimated contract operating margin based initially on estimated contract sales and cost since contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of work to be performed the effect of change orders availability and cost of materials the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we generally review and reassess our sales cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available changes in estimates of contract sales and cost are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems as well as advanced electronic equipment and software that often include technology at the forefront of science changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated unanticipated risks affecting contract costs availability performance or other issues with our subcontractors or suppliers changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and general and administrative expenses and changes in estimated award and incentive fees eacs are also adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance these risks typically include technical schedule and performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the changes in estimates may include identified opportunities for operating margin improvement 

for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive loss income see the consolidating operating results section above and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units which comprise our operating segments the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test an interim impairment test may be required if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill of our reporting units may be impaired during an interim period such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions 

the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to 

 35  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

we corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings 

retirement benefits 

overview  – the determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of several actuarial assumptions we perform an annual review of these assumptions in consultation with our outside actuaries in the event we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and other postretirement benefit expense could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated fair market value of plan assets and life expectancy for those covered by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is determined using a portfolio of bonds matching the notional cash outflows related to benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 412 percent  at december 31 2014  and 499 percent  at december 31 2013  

the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes and the accounting corridor is applied the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2014  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2014  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and 2015  expected pension and other postretirement expense 



cash balance crediting rate   a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings the cash balance crediting rate tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and pension expense in comparison to the discount rate although current 30year treasury bond rates are near historically low levels we expect such bond rates to rise in the future the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 275 percent  as of december 31 2014  growing to 35 percent  by 2020  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2014  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2014  pension benefit obligations and 2015  expected pension expense 



 36  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested through consultation with our investment management team and outside investment advisers management develops expected longterm returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes in addition to our historical investment performance we consider several factors including current market data such as yieldspriceearnings ratios historical market returns over long periods and periodic surveys of investment managers’ expectations using policy target allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns a weightedaverage expected return is calculated   

the assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with those used for other postretirement benefits the longterm rate of return on plan assets used for medical and life benefits is reduced to allow for the impact of tax on expected returns as the earnings of certain voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trusts are taxable unlike the pension trust 

for 2014  and 2013  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and assumed an expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement benefit plan assets of 745 percent  and 733 percent  respectively for 2015  we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent  on pension plans and 758 percent  on other postretirement benefit plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2014  expected longterm rate of return on plan asset assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2015  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

mortality rate – mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants in october 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued updated mortality tables rp2014 and a mortality improvement scale mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than previously projected in consideration of this information we studied our historical mortality experience and developed an expectation for continued future mortality improvements based on this data and the rp2014 tables we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and postretirement benefit obligations recognized at december 31 2014  and the amounts estimated for our 2015  pension and postretirement benefit expense our updated mortality assumptions resulted in an increase of 18 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2014  

for further information regarding our pension and postretirement benefits see risk factors in part i item 1a and note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and counsel we determine whether to record a charge to earnings and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us determinations regarding whether to record a charge and if so of what amount reflect managements assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 

environmental matters   we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more or less extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity risk 

we are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of trading and availableforsale marketable securities with a fair value of 336 million  at december 31 2014  these securities are exposed to market volatilities changes in price and interest rates 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on variablerate shortterm credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2014  at december 31 2014  we have 59 billion  of longterm debt primarily consisting of fixedrate debt with a fair value of approximately 67 billion  the terms of our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity therefore we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixedrate debt however we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange longterm debt prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to our international operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2014  foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 139 million  were outstanding at december 31 2014 a 10  percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our foreign currency forward contracts 

inflation risk 

we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance

customer concentration 

our primary customer is the us government revenue from the us government which excludes foreign military sales  a method to sell us defense equipment and services to foreign governments through the dod accounted for 86 percent  or more of total revenues in each of the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  international sales which include foreign military sales accounted for 25 billion  21 billion  and 21 billion  or 10 percent  8 percent  and 8 percent  of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively no single program accounted for more than ten percent of total revenue during any period presented see risk factors in part i item 1a

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense intelligence and federal markets airbus group bae systems boeing booz allen hamilton finmeccanica general dynamics l3 communications leidos lockheed martin raytheon and thales are some of our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made at december 31 2013  total backlog was 370 billion  compared with 408 billion  at the end of 2012  of the backlog at december 31 2013  approximately 196 billion  is expected to be converted into sales in 2014  for backlog by segment see backlog in part ii item 7 

research and development 

our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to us government programs companysponsored ird efforts are included in general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts while customersponsored research and development efforts are charged directly to the related contracts companysponsored ird expenses totaled 507 million  520 million  and 543 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

patents 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material adverse effect on our financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows see risk factors in part i item 1a 

raw materials

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our 65300  employees of which approximately 3300  are covered by 16  collective bargaining agreements we negotiated renewals of three  of our collective bargaining agreements in 2013  and expect to negotiate renewals of two  of our collective bargaining agreements in 2014  these negotiations did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows for risks associated with collective bargaining agreements see risk factors in part i item 1a

regulatory matters 

government contract regulation 

our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations including those relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts the us government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance if a us government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience in the event of a stop work order we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts additionally we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments see risk factors in part i item 1a 

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including such restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities due to the longterm nature of our contracts with the us government and the products and services covered by these contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting under the percentage of completion method of accounting revenues are generally recognized as costs are incurred costtocost method or as units are delivered unitsofdelivery method unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to lobbying costs certain legal costs charitable donations advertising costs and interest expense our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee award fee and incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs award and incentive fees are based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against negotiated criteria and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer certain fixedprice incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a ceiling amount typically through a costsharing limit that affects profitability these types of fixedprice incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged

the following table summarizes sales for the year ended december 31 2013  recognized by contract type and customer 



 profit margins may vary materially depending on among other things the negotiated contract fee arrangements the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations and laws in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

environmental 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment the estimated cost to complete remediation is accrued when it is probable that the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts and the costs are estimable to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company taking into account the facts currently available to the company regarding each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances see risk factors in part i item 1a as well as note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

in 2009 we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 in 2010 we established goals for water usage and solid waste generation we have exceeded our goal for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and are on track to achieve our goals on water usage and solid waste generation 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and satisfy green initiatives including our goals at this time these costs have not had and we do not expect that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position annual results of operations andor cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived more than 86 percent  of our total revenues during each of the past several years the us government is implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels military strategy and planning andor changes in socialpolitical priorities a shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in this challenging fiscal environment in the event of a stop work order contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts in this challenging environment our business and industry could face terminations change orders and stop work orders which depending on their volume could further delay and jeopardize the ability to recover costs 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable the impact severity and duration of the current us economic situation and plans adopted by the us government along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract

under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets of at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as sequestration which took effect march 1 2013 and resulted in approximately 40 billion of additional reductions to the fy 2013 defense budget 

in march 2013 the president signed into law the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 which included specific appropriations for our major federal customers including the dod subject to further reductions or sequestration under the budget control act    

in october 2013 congress passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through january 15 2014 subsequently extended through january 18 2014 and suspended the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling through february 7 2014 

in december 2013 congress passed the national defense authorization act ndaa for fy 2014 congress also passed and the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which set discretionary spending levels for fy 2014 and fy 2015 the legislation provides for additional budget funding of approximately 63 billion over fy 2014 and fy 2015 the additional funding is expected to alleviate some budget cuts that would otherwise have been instituted through sequestration in fy 2014 and fy 2015 with approximately 45 billion generally split equally between defense and nondefense spending applied to fy 2014 

on january 16 2014 congress passed the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 providing for federal spending levels consistent with the bipartisan budget act of 2013 the president signed the legislation into law on january 17 2014 the discretionary spending levels for fy 2014 total approximately 11 trillion of which the defense spending level is 572 billion comprised of 487 billion in base defense and 85 billion in overseas contingency operations oco funds   

the presidents budget request for fy 2015 is currently due to congress in february 2014 congressional appropriation and authorization of spending for fy 2015 and beyond including defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule congress and the administration also continue to debate the debt ceiling among other fiscal issues as they negotiate plans for longterm national fiscal policy the outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular    

if the existing debt ceiling is not raised we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments   a debt ceiling breach could among other impacts have significant near and longterm consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry it could negatively affect the us governments timely payment of our billings result in delayed cash collections and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows   

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remain a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in lower awards revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts members of congress continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on our company and the entire defense industry 

long term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition budget cuts could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and our employee base while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the department of defense dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the longterm impact of the budget control act other defense spending cuts and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain and our business and industry could be materially adversely affected

 us government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements these regulations and requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs and are regularly evolving new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to allowability of compensation costs counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and the dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits or suspension or debarment whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

we are from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations we also are subject to and expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cost accounting standards cas federal acquisition regulation far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination the loss of export privileges the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 sales to customers outside the us are an increasingly important component of our strategy our international business is subject to numerous political and economic factors legal requirements crosscultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our us business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate 

our international business is subject to both us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings data protection investment exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act labor and employment taxes security restrictions and intellectual property failure by us our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

changes in regulations political environments or security risks may affect our ability to conduct business in international markets our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and may be further impacted by global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements 

the services and products we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors are sometimes in countries with unstable governments andor developing legal systems in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties or damage to our products it also exposes the company to additional financial contractual and legal risks 

 10  

northrop grumman corporation 

we maintain insurance and take other steps to mitigate the risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations but these steps may not be adequate to prevent loss or to cover resulting claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs in addition any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity which could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are and may become subject to various administrative civil or criminal litigation environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations investigations claims or litigation if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows any investigation claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

 we have implemented extensive policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others working on our behalf that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents or others working on our behalf and the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase in the current environment and as we expand globally such improper actions could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies fewer new program starts and an increased focus on affordability changes in us defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities we are facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from us foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we will experience declines in revenues and market share which would negatively impact our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we also are seeing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in significant expense to the company contract modifications or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services and our ability to provide the people 

 11  

northrop grumman corporation 

technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain in our industry for compensationrelated or other reasons we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain necessary employees failure to maintain a qualified workforce would result in significant difficulty in performing under our contracts 

approximately 3300  of our 65300 employees are covered by an aggregate of 16  collective bargaining agreements and we expect to negotiate renewals of two of our collective bargaining agreements in 2014 collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration if we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting requirements 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profitability could be inaccurate cost estimates design issues unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected we have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future for example such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase or initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed technical or quality issues the costs timeliness and availability of materials and components issues with significant subcontractors availability performance quality financial strength the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer the effect of any changes in law or regulation and natural or environmental disasters further items affecting our contract value may include the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than cost type contracts in 2013 approximately 47 percent  of our annual revenues were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights if the terms specified in our contracts are not met our profitability may be reduced and we may incur a loss fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our fixedprice contracts this type of work is inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts and as a result there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are typically reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 

other contracts are also subject to risk for example under a fixedprice incentive contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are paid up to a ceiling which can affect profitability further under a cost type contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in recognizing profit which ultimately may not be earned or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

 when agreeing to contractual terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these assumptions and projections assess the cost productivity and availability of labor future levels of business base complexity of the work to be performed cost and availability of materials and components impact of potential delays in performance and timing of product deliveries contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profitability 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and on our overall financial position results of operations andor cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 as a defense contractor we face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure and threats from terrorist acts although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient these threats could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel or infrastructure andor damage to our reputation they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

cybersecurity threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information ours or that of our customers or partners and corruption of data networks or systems these events if not prevented or effectively mitigated could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we provide cyber and information technology systems products and services to various customers government and commercial and other third parties who also face these types of cybersecurity threats our systems products and 

 13  

northrop grumman corporation 

services may themselves be subject to cybersecurity threats andor they may not be able to detect or deter such threats to our customers or effectively to mitigate resulting losses these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company they could result in damage to our reputation loss of business and potential liability any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of among other items an increased focus on affordability efficiencies recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in its ongoing efforts to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control further the dcmadcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives designed to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced others are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

these efforts have had and we expect them to continue to have a significant impact on the contracting environment in which we do business in connection with these cost reduction initiatives the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor while the impact to our business as a result of these changes remains uncertain our business and industry could be materially adversely affected 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies provide intellectual property and perform some of the services we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers 

our ability to perform our obligations on time as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner changes in economic conditions including changes in defense budgets or credit availability could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers andor their ability to perform the inability of our suppliers to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers 

our costs may increase over the term of our contracts through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts we may be protected from increases in certain costs to the extent the increases in our costs are in line with the escalation provisions in those contracts however the difference in basis between our actual costs and these escalation provisions may expose us to cost growth even with these provisions a significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials components or intellectual property required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer there are currently several components for which there may only be one supplier if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs we may be unable to find a suitable alternative consistent with the industry’s efforts our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of conflict materials or counterfeit or unauthorized parts or materials in some circumstances we must rely on certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding the parts or materials we procure if certifications received from our subcontractors or suppliers are inaccurate if we are unable to procure needed materials components or parts or if the parts we procure are counterfeit or not authorized it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

northrop grumman corporation 

changes in economic conditions as well as changes in the defense budget can adversely affect the ability of our subcontractors and suppliers to perform and further increase this risk 

 goodwill accounts for approximately half of our total assets we test goodwill amounts for impairment at least annually and consider whether an interim test is required if we believe potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer including the impact of reductions to the defense budget and issues surrounding the national debt ceiling if our contracts are cancelled modified or terminated as a result of the resolution of these issues or otherwise our revenues profits and cash flows could be substantially lower than our current projections in addition marketbased inputs to the calculations in the impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could be negatively impacted such circumstances may result in an impairment of our goodwill further the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors including the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability therefore the impact of changes in the discount rate on our pension liability could result in an impairment of goodwill absent any changes discussed above we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets significant writeoffs of goodwill or other longlived assets could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time acquire an interest in a business even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates and we may experience unforeseen issues that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs 

environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations these laws and regulations may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration the listing could continue until the epa concludes that the cause of the violation has been corrected because listed facilities generally cannot be used in performing any us government contract until the violation is corrected if we were listed on the excluded parties list it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

the adoption of new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts sanctions or penalties could negatively impact our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property typically for government purposes more recently we believe the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property 

 15  

northrop grumman corporation 

rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights against claims by the us government or others our business could be adversely affected moreover the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by these laws and foreign courts may not be the same as the remedies available under us law 

 we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters our business also may be subject to environmental disasters although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer could reduce our profitability or result in a termination of the prime contract which could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

natural and environmental disasters could also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us 

disputes with insurance carriers over policy terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of cash flows and if litigation over coverage terms with the insurer becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available are typically subject to certain terms or limitations and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred

 as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time merge with or acquire businesses dispose of or spinoff businesses form joint ventures or create strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies the adequacy of the due diligence the management of the operations and market conditions following these transactions accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges liabilities amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longlived assets guarantees partner performance and indemnifications divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through guarantees indemnifications or other financial arrangements following the transaction although we have established procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

additionally due to government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our us government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows the cost accounting rules have been revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 these rules better align but do not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain furthermore changes in applicable domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability deferred tax assets are required to be measured at the statutory tax rate currently in effect therefore a change in the us corporate tax rate would result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets through the income tax provision the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and significantly affect our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 our nuclearrelated operations subject us to various risks including potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials we are also subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control the us government and prime contractors sometimes provide certain indemnity and other protection under certain of our government related contracts pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 and the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act for certain nuclearrelated risks if there was a nuclear incident and that indemnity or other protection especially in connection with a 

 17  

northrop grumman corporation 

commercial contract was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 in connection with the spinoff of our former shipbuilding business we received a letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution except that our shareholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash the ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and hii regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters 

we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the opinion to be incomplete or untrue at the time of the spinoff transaction nevertheless if the irs determines that any of the factual statements or representations that the irs ruling or the opinion was based on were incomplete or untrue or if certain facts or circumstances upon which the irs ruling or the opinion was based were materially different from those at the time of the spinoff we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

 in connection with the spinoff transaction we entered into a number of agreements with hii setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation for example under the separation and distribution agreement from and after the spinoff transaction each of hii and northrop grumman is generally responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spinoff it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and hii and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to hii for example tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if hii were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations 

in addition third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which hii has agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have under our agreements with hii may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hii or the us government any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid in addition certain indemnities that we may be required to provide hii are not subject to a cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business these risks could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

political and economic environment 

the us government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges which affect funding for its discretionary and nondiscretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period and the fiscal year fy 2013 impacts were incorporated in the us governments fy 2013 budget part ii mandated substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” which took effect march 1 2013 and resulted in approximately 40 billion of additional reductions to the fy 2013 defense budget   

in march 2013 the president signed into law the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 which included specific appropriations for our major federal customers including the dod subject to further reductions or sequestration under the budget control act    

in october 2013 congress passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through january 15 2014 subsequently extended through january 18 2014 and suspended the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt the debt ceiling through february 7 2014 

in december 2013 congress passed the national defense authorization act ndaa for fy 2014 congress also passed and the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which set discretionary spending levels for fy 2014 and fy 2015 the legislation provides for additional budget funding of approximately 63 billion over fy 2014 and fy 2015 the additional funding is expected to alleviate some budget cuts that would otherwise have been instituted through sequestration in fy 2014 and fy 2015 with approximately 45 billion generally split equally between defense and nondefense spending applied to fy 2014   

on january 16 2014 congress passed the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 providing for federal spending levels consistent with the bipartisan budget act of 2013 the president signed the legislation into law on january 17 2014 the discretionary spending levels for fy 2014 total approximately 11 trillion of which the defense spending level is 572 billion comprised of 487 billion in base defense and 85 billion in overseas contingency operations oco funds   

the presidents budget request for fy 2015 is currently due to congress in february 2014 congressional appropriation and authorization of spending for fy 2015 and beyond including defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule congress and the administration also continue to debate the debt ceiling among other fiscal issues as they negotiate plans for longterm national fiscal policy the outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and the companys programs in particular    

if the existing debt ceiling is not raised we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments   a debt ceiling breach could among other impacts have significant near and longterm consequences for our company our employees our suppliers and the defense industry it could negatively affect the us governments timely payment of our billings result in delayed cash collections and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows   

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remain a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in lower awards revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts members of congress continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on our company and the entire defense industry   

faced with continued budget uncertainty and continued threats to national security the dod is reviewing the roles and structure of the us military in january 2012 the dod announced a new defense strategy intended to guide its priorities and budgeting decisions the strategy calls for the us military to project power globally and operate effectively in all domains including cyberspace and places particular emphasis on asia pacific as an area of strategic focus in march 2013 the secretary of defense directed senior pentagon officials to conduct a 

 25  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

comprehensive strategic review of the dod strategy including examination of the choices underlying the strategy force posture investments and institutional management in light of the budgetary and strategic environment the dod briefed the results of this review in late july 2013 and provided some broad indications of the choices being weighed in examining budget constraints within a sequestration environment over the next decade the dod determined reductions in personnel compensation and benefits force structure and modernization likely would be necessary on force planning the review broadly outlined several options some that favor current capacity and others that emphasize future investments the dod has stated that while the review demonstrated various alternatives decisions are still being finalized program and budget deliberations for the fy 2015 defense plan currently scheduled for delivery to congress in february 2014 are ongoing within the dod the next quadrennial defense review is scheduled to be completed and delivered to congress in 2014 these various strategic reviews as well as budget plans proposed by the administration and considered by congress may impact future funding for the companys programs 

we believe spending on recapitalization modernization and maintenance of defense intelligence and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing individual systems and provide realtime integration of surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms we expect significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike missile defense command and control network communications enhanced situational awareness satellite systems restricted programs cybersecurity technical services and information technology as well as numerous homeland security programs 

the company believes it has additional international opportunities direct and foreign military sales beyond those realized today to sell its products and services outside the us market particularly in the domains of unmanned systems cyber c4isr logistics and manned military aircraft the administration is addressing and supporting export control reforms that could enhance our ability to take advantage of these opportunities the company is dedicating additional resources to expanding its international sales with emphases on australia the middle east asia and europe through both organic growth and acquisitions to the extent these efforts are successful increases in international awards revenues profits and cash flows may offset or partially offset potential declines resulting from the us political and economic environment described above 

see risk factors located in part i item 1a for a more complete description of risks we face 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs two or more closelyrelated contracts with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described later in this section sales on our portfolio of longterm contracts is primarily recognized using the costtocost method of percentage of completion accounting but in some cases the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulation far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract cost which is the key driver of our sales and operating income 

our contract management process involves the use of contract estimatesatcompletion eacs that are generally prepared and evaluated on a bottomsup basis at least annually and reviewed on a quarterly basis over the contracts period of performance these eacs include an estimated contract operating margin based initially on the contract award amount adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance these risks typically include technical risk schedule risk and performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the eacs may include identified opportunities for operating margin rate improvement over the contracts period of performance our program management organizations perform evaluations of contract performance and adjust the contract revenue and cost estimates to reflect the latest reliable information available 

our business and program management organizations are comprised of skilled professional managers whose objective is to satisfy the customers expectations deliver high quality products and services and manage contract cost risks and opportunities to achieve an appropriate operating margin rate on the contract our comprehensive business and contract management process is a coordinated process involving personnel with expertise from various disciplines including engineering production control contracts cost management mission assurance and quality finance and supply chain among others as part of this overall contract management function personnel monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and compliance with us

government regulations contract operating income and periodtoperiod contract operating margin rates are adjusted over the contracts period of performance to reflect the latest estimated revenue and cost for the contract including changes in the risks and opportunities affecting the contract such adjustments are accounted for under the cumulative catchup method of accounting and may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on operating income depending upon the specific conditions affecting each contract 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in cost or sales from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance refers to changes in contract margin rates for the period primarily related to the changes in estimates referred to above 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights excluding the results of discontinued operations are presented in the table below 



sales 

sales for 2013   decreased   557 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2012  sales for 2012   decreased   12 billion  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011  

the table below shows the variances in segment sales from the respective prior years 



for further information by segment refer to segment operating results below and for product and service detail refer to the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results 

operating costs and expenses 

operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally allocated to contracts as incurred in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs allowable and allocable general and administrative costs are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress

operating costs and expenses comprise the following 

2013  –  product and service costs for 2013   decreased   356 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2012  consistent with the change in sales general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales decreased  to 91 percent  in 2013  from 97 percent  in 2012  the decrease reflects lower indirect costs principally related to cost reduction initiatives at information systems as well as lower bid and proposal expenses 

2012  – product and service costs for 2012   decreased   11 billion  or 6 percent  as compared with 2011  the primary driver of the reduction in product and service costs was reduced volume at electronic systems information systems and technical services general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased  to 97 percent  in 2012  from 89 percent  in 2011  the increase includes the impact of lower sales higher indirect costs related to compensation accruals and cost classification changes to standardize cost accounting practices at one of our segments as well as higher bid and proposal expenses 

for the product and service costs detail see the product and service analysis section that follows segment operating results 

operating income 

we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses which includes general and administrative expenses changes in estimated contract operating income at completion resulting from changes in estimated sales operating costs and expenses are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting the aggregate effects of these changes in our estimated costs at completion across our portfolio of contracts can have a significant effect on our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods cumulative catchup adjustments are presented in the table below 



federal and foreign income taxes 

2013  – the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2013  was 318 percent  as compared with 333 percent  in 2012  the companys lower effective tax rate for 2013  includes a 37 million  benefit for the american taxpayer relief act enacted in january 2013 which reinstated research tax credits for 2012 and 2013 and a 21 million  benefit for higher section 199 manufacturing deductions than in the prior year 

2012  – the effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2012  was 333 percent  as compared with 323 percent  in 2011  the higher effective tax rate reflects the change in net tax benefits related to the absence of research tax credits which expired at the end of 2011 although the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 extended the research tax credit through 2013 it was not enacted until january 2013 

diluted earnings per share 

2013  – diluted earnings per share for 2013   increased  by 054  or 7 percent  as compared with 2012  the higher diluted earnings per share is primarily due to the benefit of 2012 and 2013 share repurchases 

2012  – diluted earnings per share for 2012   increased  by 029  or 4 percent  as compared with 2011  the higher diluted earnings per share reflects the benefit of 2011 and 2012 share repurchases and higher segment operating income partially offset by lower earnings reflecting the lower net financial accounting standardscost accounting standards fascas pension adjustment

cash provided by continuing operations 

2013  – net cash provided by continuing operations for 2013   decreased  by 157 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  principally due to higher voluntary pension contributions in 2013  partially offset by changes in trade working capital in 2013 we contributed 579 million  to our pension plans of which 500 million  was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 367 million  in 2012 of which 300 million  was voluntarily prefunded 

2012  – net cash provided by continuing operations for 2012   increased  by 293 million  or 12 percent  as compared with 2011  principally driven by lower pension contributions partially offset by higher income taxes paid in 2012  we voluntarily prefunded our pension plans by 300 million  as compared to 10 billion  in 2011  

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned in four segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems and technical services this section discusses segment sales operating income and operating margin rates the reconciliation of segment sales to total sales is provided in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 with the difference being intersegment sales eliminations for purposes of the discussion in this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating income margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate 

for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see the business descriptions in part i item 1 

segment operating income 

segment operating income as reconciled below is a nongaap measure and is used by management as an internal measure for financial performance of our operating segments segment operating income is defined as operating income less certain corporatelevel expenses that are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas or far and net fascas pension differences 



2013  segment operating income for 2013   decreased  by 96 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease in segment operating income was principally due to lower sales the decrease in operating margin rate reflects lower net favorable adjustments in 2013 partially offset by higher contract margin rates across our portfolio resulting from several factors including the continuing effect of prior net favorable adjustments 

2012  segment operating income for 2012   increased  by 121 million  or 4 percent  as compared with 2011  due to a number of factors including improved performance particularly at electronic systems the improved performance reflects mitigation of contract risks and cost reduction initiatives as well as portfolio shaping efforts the increase in segment operating margin rate reflects this improved segment performance on lower sales 

the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



for financial statement purposes we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with gaap under fas we charge the costs of these plans to our contracts in accordance with the far and the related cas that govern such 

 29  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

plans the net fascas pension adjustment is pension expense determined in accordance with gaap less pension expense charged to contracts and included in segment operating income the increase in net fascas pension adjustment  during 2013  reflects an update for actual demographic experience as of january 1 2013 which resulted in an increase to the companys   2013  cas pension expense   

unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses other than fas pension costs not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules and therefore not allocated to the segments such as a portion of management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses the decrease in unallocated corporate expenses for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to lower yearoveryear provisions for disallowed costs and litigation matters and the favorable settlement of overhead claims partially offset by changes in deferred tax assets due to lower blended state income tax rates 

aerospace systems 



2013   aerospace systems sales for 2013  were slightly higher than 2012  due to higher volume on manned military aircraft programs offset by lower volume on unmanned and space programs the increase in manned military aircraft programs reflects higher sales of 107 million  from increased deliveries on the f35 program as well as higher volume on the b2 and e2d advanced hawkeye programs partially offset by lower volume on various other programs the decrease for unmanned programs reflects lower sales of 295 million  on the global hawk program largely due to rampdown on sustainment support and logistics contracts partially offset by higher sales of 187 million  on the nato alliance ground surveillance ags program resulting from rampup activities the decrease in space programs reflects lower volume for restricted programs due to rampdown activities and higher volume on the james webb space telescope jwst and advanced extremely high frequency aehf programs 

operating income and operating margin rate for 2013  were comparable to 2012 operating income and operating margin rate also reflect the impact of a forward loss recognized on a restricted program which was offset by the continuing effect of higher contract margin rates across the segment principally related to prior net favorable adjustments 

2012   aerospace systems sales for 2012  were comparable to 2011 sales of unmanned systems increased approximately 280 million primarily related to ramping up on the nato ags and fire scout programs additionally there was higher volume of approximately 200 million on the f35 program due to deliveries on lrip 5 the first f35 contract accounted for under the unitsofdelivery method these increases were offset by the termination of a weather satellite program which reduced sales by approximately 175 million as well as lower sales on the joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars fa18 and certain restricted space programs 

operating income and operating margin rate for 2012  were comparable to 2011 the operating income and operating margin rate reflect approximately 90 million lower operating income from the fa18 programs lower volume and transition from the multiyear 2 contract to the lower margin multiyear 3 contract principally offset by performance improvements in space systems and higher operating margin rates and volume on sales of unmanned systems 

electronic systems 



2013   electronic systems sales for 2013   increased   199 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  the increase was due to higher sales on international programs of 244 million  and space programs partially offset by lower 

 30  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

sales on navigation and maritime systems programs of 132 million  due to decreased deliveries as well as lower volume on laser systems programs associated with intheater force reductions 

operating income for 2013   increased   39 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2012  consistent with the higher sales volume described above operating margin rate was comparable with 2012 and reflects higher margin rates on our current portfolio of programs a reduction in net favorable adjustments and the reversal of a 26 million nonprogrammatic risk reserve 

2012   electronic systems sales for 2012   decreased   422 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2011  the decrease was largely due to lower volume of approximately 160 million on infrared countermeasures sales and approximately 250 million lower postal automation sales including approximately 150 million from our decision to deemphasize our us postal automation business these declines as well as declines due to troop draw down and reduced overseas contingency operations funding were partially offset by approximately 190 million higher volume on space programs 

operating income for 2012   increased   117 million  or 11 percent  as compared with 2011  operating margin rate increased to 171 percent  in 2012  from 145 percent  in 2011  the higher operating income and operating margin rate reflect approximately 160 million of additional performance improvements over 2011  primarily on several combat avionics programs these performance improvements include the effect of unfavorable adjustments of approximately 50 million on a domestic postal automation program in the prior year that did not recur in 2012 

information systems 



2013   information systems sales for 2013   decreased   760 million  or 10 percent  as compared with 2012  the sales decline includes a 98 million impact for the transfer of intercompany efforts to our corporate shared services organization excluding the transfer 2013 sales declined 9 percent due to lower funding levels including the impacts of sequestration and lower volume for programs impacted by intheater force reductions and contract completions 

operating income for 2013   decreased   128 million  or 17 percent  as compared with 2012  operating margin rate decreased to 96 percent  in 2013  from 103 percent  in 2012  lower operating income and operating margin rate were primarily due to the lower sales volume described above and a 73 million  reduction in net favorable adjustments compared with the prior year 

2012   information systems sales for 2012   decreased   565 million  or 7 percent  as compared with 2011  with no single program driving a significant portion the decline in sales reflects the termination or winddown on a number of programs including the joint tactical radio systems airborne maritime and fixed jtrs amf installation kits ikits enterprise network management enm and f22 programs partially offset by higher volume of approximately 110 million on the encore ii information technology support program as well as higher volume on the air and space operations center enterprise system development and ground combat vehicle programs further reducing sales was lower volume on restricted programs as well as the sale of the county of san diego it outsourcing contract and the sale of park air norway which together reduced sales by approximately 100 million as compared to 2011 

operating income for 2012   decreased   5 million  or 1 percent  as compared with 2011  operating margin rate increased to 103 percent  in 2012  from 97 percent  in 2011  the higher operating margin rate is primarily driven by performance improvements across a number of contracts which largely offset the impact of lower volume on operating income

technical services 



2013   technical services sales for 2013   decreased   176 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of 127 million  on the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm and integrated logistics and modernization programs as well as portfolio shaping efforts 

operating income for 2013   decreased   6 million  or 2 percent  as compared with 2012  operating margin rate increased to 92 percent  in 2013  from 89 percent  in 2012  lower operating income was driven by the lower sales volume described above partially offset by higher operating margin rate primarily due to improved performance across a number of programs 

2012   technical services sales for 2012   decreased   174 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011  the decrease was primarily due to reduced volume from portfolio shaping of approximately 70 million as we focused our operations into core areas lower kc10 logistics activity of approximately 60 million and lower icbm logistics and modernization activity of approximately 50 million 

operating income for 2012   increased   8 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2011  operating margin rate increased to 89 percent  in 2012  from 81 percent  in 2011  the higher operating income and operating margin rate were primarily due to improved performance on the kc10 program partially offset by lower sales volume as described above 

product and service analysis 



 2013   product costs as a percentage of product sales for 2013   increased   40  basis points as compared with 2012  the increase is primarily due to lower product operating margins in newly awarded programs at information systems 

service costs as a percentage of service sales for 2013   increased   50  basis points as compared with 2012  the increase is primarily due to lower service operating margins at aerospace systems and information systems 

2012   product costs as a percentage of product sales for 2012   decreased   90  basis points as compared with 2011  this improvement reflects higher margins on combat avionics at electronic systems 

service costs as a percentage of service sales for 2012   decreased   100  basis points as compared with 2011  this improvement reflects higher service margins in all four business segments the improvement is principally driven by higher margins on certain military aircraft programs at aerospace systems and an increase in favorable performance adjustments across a number of programs at electronic systems

the following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment 

 product sales and product costs 

2013   product sales for 2013  were comparable with 2012  primarily due to lower product sales at aerospace systems offset by higher product sales at information systems and electronic systems the decrease at aerospace systems reflects the revision in the classification of certain operations maintenance and sustainment contracts from product to service in 2013  the increase at information systems was primarily due to newly awarded product contracts and the increase at electronic systems was primarily driven by higher volume as described in the segment operating results section above 

product costs for 2013  were comparable with 2012  primarily due to lower product costs at aerospace systems offset by higher product costs at information systems and electronic systems the decrease at aerospace systems was consistent with the classification change noted above the decrease was offset by newly awarded product contracts at information system and higher sales volume at electronic systems as described above 

2012   product sales for 2012   decreased   733 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011  primarily due to lower product sales at electronic systems and technical services partially offset by higher product sales at information systems the decrease at electronic systems primarily relates to lower volume of approximately 90 million in combat avionics and approximately 250 million in domestic and international postal automation programs the decline at technical services was due to the change in classification of the icbm program from product to service at the beginning of 2012 as the program transitioned from modernization to predominantly sustainment services the increase at information systems was primarily driven by higher intercompany volume 

product costs for 2012   decreased  by 725 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011  primarily due to lower sales volume and increased performance improvement adjustments at electronic systems and the change in classification of the icbm program at technical services offset by higher product volume at information systems as described above 

service sales and service costs 

2013   service sales for 2013   decreased   688 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  primarily due to lower service sales at information systems partially offset by higher service sales at aerospace systems the decrease at information systems is due to lower service sales across a number of programs as described in the segment operating results section above the higher service sales at aerospace systems reflects the revision in the 

 33  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

classification from product to service as described above and higher volume on certain military aircraft service contracts in 2013  

service costs for 2013   decreased   553 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2012  primarily due to lower service volume at information systems partially offset by higher service sales at aerospace systems consistent with the change in service sales described above 

2012   service sales for 2012   decreased   415 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2011  primarily due to lower service sales at information systems across a number of programs partially offset by the transition of the icbm program from product to service at technical services and higher service volume at electronic systems 

service costs for 2012   decreased   544 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011  due to lower sales at information systems partially offset by the transition of the icbm program from product to service at technical services as described above and higher service volume at electronic systems the service activities at aerospace systems and electronic systems were performed at higher operating margin rates than in 2011  resulting in service costs decreasing more than service sales 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2013  and 2012  



approximately 196 billion  of the 370 billion  total backlog at december 31 2013  is expected to be converted into sales in 2014  us government orders comprised 80 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2013  international orders including foreign military sales accounted for 14 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2013  domestic commercial backlog represented 6 percent  of total backlog at the end of 2013  

new awards 

2013   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2013  was 219 billion  on a net basis awards during 2013  totaled 209 billion  reflecting 10 billion  of adjustments during the first half of the year to reduce information systems unfunded backlog principally associated with expired periods of performance on active contracts including several previously awarded task orders on idiq contracts significant new awards during 2013  include 22 billion  for the f35 program 13 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 866 million  for the aehf program 694 million  for the b2 program and 632 million  for the triton program 

2012   the estimated value of contract awards recorded during 2012  was 265 billion  significant new awards in 2012  included 17 billion  for the nato ags unmanned system program 14 billion  for the jwst program 13 billion  for the f35 program 12 billion  for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 10 billion  for international air defense programs and 689 million  for the global hawk program 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating earnings into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow net debttoequity and net debttocapital we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance and condition

during the second quarter of 2013 the companys board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 40 billion  of the company’s common stock at the same time the company announced its plan to repurchase shares with the goal of retiring approximately 25 percent of its then outstanding shares 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting as of december 31 2013 we had repurchased 208 million  shares towards that goal 

during the second quarter of 2013  the company also issued 285 billion  of unsecured senior notes the notes the company used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 850 million  of unsecured senior notes due in 2014 and 2015 see note 10  in part ii item 8 the remaining net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes including debt repayments share repurchases pension plan funding acquisitions and working capital 

cash balances and cash generated from continuing operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed is expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months as of december 31 2013  the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was 597 million  we currently do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations capital expenditure commitments were 524 million at december 31 2013  and are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations 



 free cash flow from continuing operations 

free cash flow from continuing operations is defined as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful measure for investors to consider as it represents the cash flow the company has available after capital spending to invest for future growth strengthen the balance sheet andor return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases free cash flow is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions the payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

free cash flow from continuing operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow from continuing operations 



cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

 35  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating activities 

2013  –  cash provided by continuing operations for 2013   decreased   157 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease was principally driven by higher voluntary pension contributions in 2013 partially offset by changes in trade working capital in 2013 we contributed 579 million  to our pension plans of which 500 million  was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 367 million  in 2012 of which 300 million  was voluntarily prefunded 

2012  –  cash provided by continuing operations for 2012   increased   293 million  or 12 percent  as compared with 2011  primarily due to lower pension contributions partially offset by higher income taxes paid in 2012  we contributed 367 million  to our pension plans of which 300 million  was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 11 billion  in 2011 of which 10 billion  was voluntarily prefunded 

investing activities 

2013  –  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for 2013   increased   262 million  or 312 percent  as compared with 2012  primarily due to 250 million in proceeds from the maturity of shortterm investments in 2012  

2012  –  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for 2012  was 84 million  as compared to the cash provided by investing activities in 2011  reflecting a 14 billion contribution received from the spinoff of our former shipbuilding business in 2011  partially offset by 250 million in proceeds from the maturity of shortterm investments in 2012 that were purchased in 2011 

financing activities 

2013  –  net cash used in financing activities for 2013   decreased   847 million  or 50 percent  as compared with 2012  the decrease was primarily due to the 20 billion of net proceeds received from the debt transactions described above partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock in 2013 

2012  –  net cash used in financing activities for 2012   decreased   18 billion  or 51 percent  as compared with 2011  reflecting approximately 980 million lower repurchases of common stock and 768 million of debt repayments in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 

credit facilities 

in august 2013 the company entered into a new   five year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1775 billion  the credit agreement the credit agreement replaced the company’s prior five year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion   entered into on september 8 2011 and its   364 day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of   500 million   entered into on september 4 2012 

the credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions including covenants restricting the companys ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens the company also cannot permit the ratio of its debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreement to exceed   65 percent  the company is in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement at december 31 2013  there was no  balance outstanding under this facility 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital  – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

financial arrangements  – in the ordinary course of business the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations at december 31 2013  there were   345 million   of standby letters of credit and guarantees and   157 million   of surety bonds outstanding

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  and the estimated timing of future cash payments 



  

 the table above also excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa for further information about future minimum contributions for these plans see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in notes 10  and 12  respectively to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

revenue recognition 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities we classify contract revenues as product or service depending on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract we consider the nature of our contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

due to the longterm nature of our contracts we generally recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as work on our contracts progresses which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services contract revenues may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer including price redetermination cost or performance incentives such as award and incentive fees unpriced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment amounts pertaining to provisions for price redetermination or for cost andor performance incentives are included in sales when they are reasonably estimable  our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineers program managers and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability and cost of materials the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations 

we update our contract estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances we generally review and reassess our revenue cost and profit estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis we recognize changes in estimates using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods revenue and profit on future periods of contract performance are recognized as if the revised estimate had been used since contract inception if it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract the entire amount of the estimable future loss is charged against income in the period the loss is identified loss

changes in contract estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope estimated revenue and cost estimates these changes are often driven by events such as changes in estimated incentive fees unanticipated risks affecting contract costs the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated and changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and general and administrative expenses we employ an extensive contract management process involving several functional organizations and numerous personnel who are skilled at managing contract activities changes in estimates are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts many of which include complex and customized aerospace and electronic equipment and software that often includes technology at the forefront of science significant changes in estimates on a single contract could have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or annual results of operations and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income see the consolidating operating results section above and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from november 30 to december 31   this change in accounting principle is preferable as it aligns the timing of our annual goodwill impairment test with our yearend financial reporting process this change did not result in the acceleration delay or avoidance of an impairment charge the company applied the change in the annual impairment date retrospectively to january 1 2011 it is impracticable to objectively determine valuation estimates necessary to apply the change in periods prior to that date there were no changes in previously reported amounts as a result of retrospectively applying the change in the annual impairment testing date  as a result of this change during 2013 we performed an annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 and as of december 31 

the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2013  and as of december 31 2013  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value the prior years annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2012  indicated one of our reporting units information systems had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by approximately five percent since the prior year the fair value of information system has substantially increased principally due to expansion in market valuations there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  

in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test an interim impairment test may be required if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill may be impaired during an interim period such indicators may include but are not limited to the loss of significant business significant decreases in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions 

when testing goodwill for impairment we compare the fair values of each of our four reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project sales operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions 

the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

we also corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 

retirement benefits 

overview  – for financial statement purposes we account for our employee pension and other postretirement plans in accordance with gaap we recognize the funded status of our retirement benefit plans on a planbyplan basis as either an asset or a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position unamortized benefit plan costs are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss within shareholders’ equity and are then amortized to expense in future periods net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to   10 percent   of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately   nine  years 

we perform an annual review of the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with our outside actuaries in the event we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future pension and other postretirement benefit expense could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate cash balance crediting rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 

the company’s 2014  fas pension expense is expected to be 115 million  the decrease in expected 2014  pension expense of 259 million  as compared to 2013  is primarily due to the increase in the company’s discount rate assumption as of december 31 2013  

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is determined using a portfolio of bonds matching the notional cash outflows related to benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 499 percent  at december 31 2013  and 412 percent  at december 31 2012  

the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2013  discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2013  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and 2014  expected pension and other postretirement expense 



cash balance crediting rate   a portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with paybased credits and interest interest is credited monthly using the 30year treasury bond rate the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings although current 30year treasury bond rates are near historically low levels we expect such bond rates to rise in the future the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 39 percent  as of december 31 2013 growing to 47 percent  by 2019  holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2013  cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2013  pension benefit obligations and 2014  expected pension expense

northrop grumman corporation 

  



expected longterm rate of return on plan assets –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested for 2013  and 2012  we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets of 80 percent  and 825 percent  respectively and assumed an expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement benefit plan assets of 733 percent  and 744 percent  respectively for 2014  we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent  on pension plans and 745 percent  on other postretirement benefit plans holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2013  expected longterm rate of return on plan asset assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2014  pension and other postretirement expense 



estimated fair market value of plan assets  – for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals comparable transactions discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims investigations lawsuits overhead cost claims environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and counsel we determine whether to record a charge to earnings and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us including any settlement offers and our assessment of the probability of liabilities and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe based on the facts available to us that a liability is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable we record our best estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss when a range of costs is reasonably estimable but no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record what we estimate as the low end of the range determinations whether to record a charge and if so of what amount reflect managements assessment regarding what is likely to occur they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us for further information on the treatment of these contingencies see note 1  note 11  and note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

us government cost claims  from time to time our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs when such findings are presented we engage us government representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed where appropriate provisions are made to reflect our expected exposure to matters raised by the us government representatives 

environmental accruals   we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more or less extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other responsible parties financial capabilities of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements or other obligations and improvements in remediation technology

customer concentration 

our primary customer is the us government revenue from the us government which includes foreign military sales – a method to sell us defense equipment and services to foreign governments through the dod accounted for 90 percent or more of total revenues in each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 no single product or service accounted for more than ten percent of total revenue during any period presented see risk factors in part i item 1a 

competitive conditions 

we compete with many companies in the defense industry and the intelligence and civil markets lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company general dynamics corporation l3 communications corporation saic bae systems inc eads and finmeccanica spa are our primary competitors key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition which is evident through the number of bid protests competitor protests of us government procurement awards and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities 

it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made at december 31 2012  total backlog was 408 billion  compared with 395 billion  at the end of 2011 approximately 214  billion of our backlog at december 31 2012 is expected to be converted into sales in 2013 for backlog by segment see backlog in part ii item 7 

research and development 

our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to us government programs companysponsored ird efforts are included in general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts while customersponsored research and development efforts are charged directly to the related contracts companysponsored ird expenses totaled 520 million  543 million  and 580 million  in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

patents 

we routinely apply for and own a number of us and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual 

northrop grumman corporation 

property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material impact on our business see risk factors in part i item 1a 

raw materials 

we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials that would have a notable adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see risk factors in part i item 1a and overview – outlook in part ii item 7 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our 68100  employees of which approximately 3300  are covered by 17  collective bargaining agreements we negotiated or renegotiated eight  of our collective bargaining agreements in 2012 and expect to renegotiate renewals for three  of our collective bargaining agreements in 2013 these negotiations had no material adverse effect on our results of operations for risks associated with collective bargaining agreements see risk factors in part i item 1a 

regulatory matters 

government contract regulation 

our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations including those relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts the us government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance if a us government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in the unusual circumstance where a us government contract does not have such termination protection we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience in the event of a stop work order we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts additionally we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments see risk factors in part i item 1a 

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this form 10k reflect the operating results of our entire company including such restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm contracts with the us government for development production and support activities due to the longterm nature of our contracts with the us government and the products and services covered by these contracts we generally recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method of accounting under the percentage of completion method of accounting revenues are generally recognized as costs are incurred costtocost method or as units are delivered unitsofdelivery method unless otherwise specified in a contract allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the us government under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations advertising costs and interest expense our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

costtype contracts  – costtype contracts include cost plus fixed fee award fee and incentive fee contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fees on costtype contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or 

northrop grumman corporation 

percentage of costs award fees are based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the companys performance against negotiated criteria and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance incentive fees provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs award fees and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor absent changes in scope by the customer fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a ceiling amount but are subject to a costshare limit that affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached timeandmaterials contracts are considered fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

the following table summarizes revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 recognized by contract type and customer 



profit margins may vary materially depending on among other things the negotiated contract fee arrangements the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations and laws in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

environmental 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment the estimated cost to complete remediation is accrued when it is probable that the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts at sites where the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp and the costs are estimable to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company taking into account the facts currently available to the company regarding each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances see risk factors in part i item 1a as well as note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

in 2009 we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 in 2010 we established goals for water usage and solid waste generation for information on the progress towards achieving our goals refer to our corporate responsibility report on our web site the information contained in our corporate responsibility report should not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this report 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and satisfy green initiatives including our goals at this time these costs have not had and we do not expect that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report 

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived more than 90 percent of our total revenues during each of the past several years the us government is implementing significant reductions in government spending and other significant program changes we cannot predict the impact on existing followon replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels military strategy and planning andor changes in socialpolitical priorities a shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in some circumstances however a us government contract does not have such termination protection in those cases we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means to the extent such means are unavailable or do not fully address the costs incurred or profit on those costs we could face significant losses from the termination for convenience of a contract that lacks termination protection termination by the us government of a contract for convenience also could result in the cancellation of future work on that program termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to material liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts 

the us government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience it is possible that the us government could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts in this challenging fiscal environment in the event of a stop work order contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract however such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the us government and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts in this 

northrop grumman corporation 

challenging environment our industry could face a significant number of terminations change orders and stop work orders which by their volume could further delay and jeopardize our industrys ability to recover costs 

 us government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable the impact severity and duration of the current us economic situation and plans adopted by the us government along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event that government funding for any of our programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in addition if the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt is not raised we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our us government contracts even if the us government is unable to make timely payments an extended delay in the timely payment of billings by the us government would likely result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in august 2011 congress enacted the budget control act which while raising the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt also committed the us government to significantly reducing the federal deficit over ten years the budget control act established caps on discretionary spending through 2021 reducing federal spending by approximately 1 trillion over that period relative to the fiscal year fy 2012 presidential budget submission and called for very substantial automatic spending cuts known as sequestration split between defense and nondefense programs 

in january 2013 congress enacted the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 it addressed a number of tax code provisions and certain spending issues but left in place the sequester although delaying its implementation to march 1 2013 and did not address other fiscal matters such as the debt ceiling the delay in the sequester leaves the dod less time to enact 2013 automatic spending cuts and adds to the uncertainty from such cuts the nations debt ceiling is currently expected to be reached during the first half of 2013 congress and the administration continue to debate these issues and the terms of a possible national fiscal approach the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans while the presidents proposed fy 2014 budget is scheduled for release in february 2013 its delivery may be delayed given these unresolved fiscal matters 

we are unable to predict the impact that the delayed automatic cuts or other defense spending cuts would have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the impact of the budget control act and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain and our business and industry could be materially adversely affected 

the presidents proposed budget for fy 2013 represented a slight decline from fy 2012 levels although congress passed a continuing resolution to fund us government operations through march 27 2013 it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed during fy 2013 the us government may operate under a continuing resolution for all of fy 2013 potentially resulting in no new contract or program starts for that year 

the congressional budget process has been marked by significant debate within the government regarding fy 2013 defense spending budget decisions made in this environment will likely have longterm consequences for our company and the entire defense industry should sequestration as currently mandated be implemented in march 2013 absent any other changes we believe it would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers 

northrop grumman corporation 

investors and communities that rely on the companies in the defense industrial base there are many variables in how the law could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill 

 us government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements these regulations and requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs new regulations or procurement requirements including for example counterfeit parts and conflict minerals or changes to current ones could increase our costs and risks and reduce our margins failure to comply with these regulations could among other things result in the withholding of payments and adversely impact our reputation and ability to participate in future us government contracts 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and dod inspector general these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cost accounting standards cas federal acquisition regulation far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such matters could also result in suspension or debarment given our dependence on government contracting and authorizations suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending for example the dod’s better buying power initiative continues to evolve in its efforts to reduce costs gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods services and solutions from defense contractors in addition the dcma has implemented cost recovery initiatives designed to prioritize efforts to recover costs and close open audits as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened period of time required to close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs are being challenged and refined 

these efforts have had and we expect them to continue to have a significant impact on the contracting environment in which we do business in support of the implementation of the better buying power initiative the us government is issuing new regulations and requirements that are shifting additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor while the impact to our business as a result of these changes remains uncertain our business and industry could be materially adversely affected 

northrop grumman corporation 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities or be willing to accept more risk or lower margins in competing for contracts we have seen and anticipate that we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies and fewer new program starts changes in us defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities we are facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from us foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we will experience declines in revenues and market share which would negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we also are seeing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in significant expense to the company contract modifications or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay earnings 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees failure to maintain a qualified workforce would result in difficulty in performing under our contracts 

approximately 3300  of our 68100 employees are covered by an aggregate of 17  collective bargaining agreements and we expect to negotiate or renegotiate renewals for three  of our collective bargaining agreements in 2013  collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements if we experience such difficulties we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor inability to achieve learning curve assumptions manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

northrop grumman corporation 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected we have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future for example such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase or initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed technical or quality issues the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and quality of their products the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters further items affecting our contract value may include the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our risk varies with the type of contract due to their nature firm fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than cost type contracts in 2012 approximately 44 percent  of our annual revenues were derived from fixedprice contracts we typically enter into fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in our contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced or a loss may be incurred fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 

other contracts are also subject to risk for example under a fixed price incentive contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are paid up to a ceiling which can affect profitability further under a cost type contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee we often enter into cost type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these cost type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

 when agreeing to contractual terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these assumptions and projections assess the cost productivity and availability of labor future levels of business base complexity of the work to be performed cost and availability of materials impact of potential delays in performance and timing of product deliveries contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts and our performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

northrop grumman corporation 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations on time as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

our costs may increase over the term of our contracts through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts we may be protected from increases in costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices however the difference in basis between our actual costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these provisions a significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials or components required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us government there are currently several components for which there may only be one supplier if a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs we may be unable to find a suitable alternative consistent with the industry’s efforts our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit parts or materials if we are unable to procure needed materials components or parts or if the parts we procure are counterfeit our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

changes in economic conditions as well as changes in the defense budget can adversely affect the ability of our subcontractors and suppliers to perform and further increase this risk 

 goodwill accounts for approximately half of our recorded total assets we test goodwill amounts for impairment at least annually and consider whether an interim test is required if we believe potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer including the potential for sequestration and issues surrounding the national debt ceiling potential contract cancellations modifications or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues profits and cash flows to be substantially lower than our current projections in addition marketbased inputs to the calculations in the impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could also be negatively impacted such circumstances may result in an impairment of our goodwill further the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors including the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability therefore an increase in the discount rate on our pension liability in 2013 or beyond could result in an impairment of goodwill absent any changes discussed above we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets 

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time acquire an interest in a business even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates and we may experience unforeseen issues that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets 

northrop grumman corporation 

 our international business remains subject to numerous political and economic factors regulatory requirements and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by us our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on us changes in regulations political environments or security risks may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including those regarding investment procurement and repatriation of earnings our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and may be further impacted by global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements 

the services and products we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors are sometimes in countries with unstable governments in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties or damage to our products we maintain insurance and take other steps to mitigate the risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations but these steps may not be adequate to prevent loss or to cover resulting claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs see additional discussion of possible inadequacy of our insurance coverage below in addition any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity for the company which may adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 we have implemented extensive policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others with whom we are doing business that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents or others with whom we are doing business and the risk of improper conduct may increase in the current environment such improper actions could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarment which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

northrop grumman corporation 

 as a defense contractor we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure and threats from terrorist acts although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing if any of these events were to materialize they could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel or infrastructure or damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

cybersecurity threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability 

we also manage information technology systems for various customers and other third parties while we operate under information security policies and procedures for managing these systems we generally face similar cybersecurity threats for these systems as for our own 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs 

environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration the listing could continue until the epa concludes that the cause of the violation had been corrected if we were listed on the excluded parties list it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows listed facilities generally cannot be used in performing any us government contract until the violation is corrected 

the adoption of new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts sanctions or penalties could negatively impact our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 the size nature and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are and may become subject to various environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims investigations and administrative civil or criminal litigation which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory or treble damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of the companys reliance on government contracts and authorizations investigations claims or litigation if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any investigation claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

 we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property the us government appears to be asserting or seeking to assert more extensive intellectual property rights our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights against claims by the us government or others our business could be adversely affected 

 we have significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters including environmental disasters although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract this could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer could result in a termination of the prime contract and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

natural disasters could also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance 

northrop grumman corporation 

 we endeavor to obtain insurance agreements from established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be insured and for risks that are insurable the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us 

disputes with insurance carriers over policy terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of cash flows and if litigation over coverage terms with the insurer becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are typically subject to certain terms or limitations and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

 as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time merge with or acquire businesses dispose of or spinoff businesses form joint ventures or create strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies the management of the operations and market conditions following these transactions accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges liabilities amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets guarantees partner performance and indemnifications divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through guarantees indemnifications or other financial arrangements following the transaction although we have established procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful 

 a tightening of credit could adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and other postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally due to government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations in december 2011 the cost accounting rules were revised in order to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 we anticipate that this rule will better align but not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 

northrop grumman corporation 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain furthermore changes in applicable domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability deferred tax assets are required to be measured at the statutory tax rate currently in effect therefore a change in the us corporate tax rate would result in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset through the income tax provision the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and significantly affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

 our nuclearrelated operations subject us to various risks including potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials we are also subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control the us government and prime contractors provide certain indemnity protection under certain of our contracts pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 and the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act for certain nuclearrelated risks if there was a nuclear incident and that indemnity protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 in connection with the spinoff of our former shipbuilding business we received a letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution except that our shareholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash the ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and hii regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters 

we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the opinion to be incomplete or untrue at the time of the spinoff transaction nevertheless if the irs determines that any of the factual statements or representations that the irs ruling or the opinion was based on were incomplete or untrue or if certain facts or circumstances upon which the irs ruling or the opinion was based were materially different from those at the time of the spinoff we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

even if the spinoff transaction otherwise qualifies as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the internal reorganization and distribution may be taxable to us but not to our shareholders if certain events occur including if before march 31 2013 there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either us or hii representing 50 or more of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution we cease to engage appropriately in the conduct of a substantial part of our existing business or we or hii repurchase shares in excess of specified levels before march 31 2013 if such tax were incurred the tax liability would be substantial hii has agreed not to undertake transactions that would reasonably be expected to trigger such tax and we intend to avoid any such transactions 

northrop grumman corporation 

 in connection with the spinoff transaction we entered into a number of agreements with hii setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation for example under the separation and distribution agreement from and after the spinoff transaction each of hii and northrop grumman is generally responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spinoff it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and hii and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to hii for example tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if hii were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations 

in addition third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which hii has agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us directly or indirectly the indemnity related rights we have under our agreements with hii may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hii or the us government any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid in addition certain indemnities that we may be required to provide hii are not subject to a cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business these risks could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

political and economic environment 

the us government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges that affect funding for its nondiscretionary and discretionary budgets part i of the budget control act of 2011 budget control act provided for a reduction in defense budgets by at least 487 billion over a ten year period part ii provided the potential for substantial additional reductions through a process known as “sequestration” the presidents proposed fiscal year fy 2013 budget represented a slight decline for defense from fy 2012 while congress has not passed a fy 2013 budget it did pass a sixmonth continuing resolution that funds the us government through march 27 2013 this continuing resolution restricts new starts and provides for discretionary spending levels that represent a slight increase over the fy 2012 budget it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed during fy 2013 the us government may operate under a continuing resolution for all of fy 2013 restricting new contract or program starts for that year 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted in january 2013 it addressed a number of tax code provisions and certain spending issues but left in place the sequester although delaying its implementation to march 1 2013 and did not address other fiscal matters such as the debt ceiling the nations debt ceiling is currently expected to be reached during the first half of 2013 congress and the administration continue to debate these issues and the terms of a possible national fiscal approach the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans while the presidents proposed fy 2014 budget is scheduled for release in february 2013 its delivery may be delayed given these unresolved broad fiscal matters 

the congressional budget process to finalize fy 2013 defense spending also has been marked by continued uncertainty and significant debate increasing the possibility of sequestration occurring as noted above the budget control act calls for additional substantial defense spending reductions through sequestration if congress is unable to agree on a budget that conforms with the budget control act requirements should sequestration as currently mandated be implemented in march 2013 absent any other changes we expect it would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including northrop grumman and the customers employees suppliers investors and communities that rely on the companies in the defense industrial base 

there continues to be much uncertainty also regarding how sequestration would be implemented if it were to go into effect there are many variables in how the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company 

members of congress are discussing various options to address sequestrations automatic spending cuts while we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely that budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 

in addition to fiscal and budgetary constraints we expect defense spending to be affected by the drawdown of us force levels tied to current major overseas deployments and other shifts in defense missions and priorities as overall defense spending declines the department of defense dod is continuing to reevaluate the role and structure of the us military in 2012 the dod announced a new defense strategy intended to guide its priorities and budgeting decisions the guidance calls for the us military to project power globally and operate effectively in all domains including cybersecurity and it places particular emphasis on asia pacific as an area of strategic focus 

we believe that spending on recapitalization modernization and maintenance of defense intelligence and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing individual systems and provide realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms we expect significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike missile defense command and control network communications enhanced situational awareness satellite systems restricted programs cybersecurity technical services and information technology contracts as well as numerous international and homeland security programs

northrop grumman corporation 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on contracts and programs two or more closelyrelated contracts with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described later in this section revenue on our portfolio of longterm contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method primarily the costtocost method but in some cases the unitsofdelivery method of percentage of completion accounting as a result sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of contracts due to federal acquisition regulations far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract costs which is the key driver of both sales and operating income 

our contract management process involves the use of contract estimatesatcompletion eacs that are generally prepared and evaluated on a bottomsup basis at least annually and reviewed on a quarterly basis over the contracts period of performance these eacs include an estimated contract operating margin based initially on the contract award amount adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance these risks typically include technical risk schedule risk and performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the eacs include identified opportunities for operating margin rate improvement over the contracts period of performance our program management organizations perform evaluations of contract performance and adjust the contract revenue and cost estimates to reflect the latest reliable information available 

our business and program management organizations are comprised of skilled professional managers whose objective is to satisfy the customers expectations deliver high quality products and services and manage contract risks and opportunities to achieve an appropriate operating margin rate on the contract our comprehensive business and contract management process is a coordinated process involving personnel with expertise from various disciplines including production control contracts cost management mission assurance and quality finance and supply chain among others  as part of this overall contract management function these personnel monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and compliance with us government regulations contract operating income and periodtoperiod contract operating margin rates are adjusted over the contracts period of performance to reflect the latest estimated revenue and cost for the contract including changes in the risks and opportunities affecting the contract such adjustments may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on operating income depending upon the specific conditions affecting each contract 

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates where applicable significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations first focuses around our four segments before distinguishing between products and services changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume deliveries or other indicators of sales activity and contract mix for purposes of this discussion volume generally refers to increases or decreases in cost or sales from productionservice activity levels or delivery rates performance refers to changes in contract margin rates for the period primarily related to the changes in estimates referred to above 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights excluding the results of discontinued operations are presented in the table below 



northrop grumman corporation 

consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2012  reflect our customers overall lower spending levels lower sales due to our portfolio shaping actions and our focus on working capital our margin rates and cash provided by operating activities demonstrate strong operating performance and our continued focus on performance and affordability as further discussed below 

segment operating income as reconciled below is a nongaap measure and is used by management as an internal measure of the financial performance of our individual operating segments 



the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



for financial statement purposes we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with gaap under financial accounting standards fas we charge the costs of these plans to our contracts in accordance with the far and the related cost accounting standards cas that govern such plans the net fascas pension adjustment is pension expense determined in accordance with gaap less pension expense charged to contracts and included in segment operating income unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses other than fas pension costs not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules and therefore not allocated to the segments such as a portion of management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses 

sales 

2012  –  sales for 2012   decreased   12 billion  or 5 percent  as compared to 2011  reflecting lower sales in three of our four operating segments 

2011  –  sales for 2011   decreased   17 billion  or 6 percent  as compared to 2010  reflecting lower sales at all four operating segments 

the table below shows the variances in segment sales from the respective prior years 



for further information by segment refer to the segment operating results below and for product and service detail refer to the product and service analysis section that follows 

northrop grumman corporation 

operating costs and expenses 

operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally allocated to contracts as they are incurred in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs these general and administrative costs are generally allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress 

operating costs and expenses consist of the following 

2012 –  product and service costs for 2012 decreased   11 billion  or 6 percent  as compared to 2011  the primary driver of the reduction in product and service costs was reduced volume at electronic systems information systems and technical services general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased  to 97 percent  in 2012 from 89 percent  in 2011  the increase includes the impact of lower sales higher indirect costs related to compensation accruals and cost classification changes to standardize cost accounting practices at one of our segments as well as higher bid and proposal expenses 

2011 – product and service costs for 2011 decreased   21 billion  or 9 percent  as compared to 2010 the primary driver of the reduction in product and service costs is reduced volume at all four of our segments with aerospace systems information systems and technical services driving the majority of the decrease general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales was comparable at 89 percent  

for the product and service costs detail see the product and service analysis section that follows 

operating income 

we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses which includes general and administrative expenses changes in estimated sales operating costs and expenses and the resulting operating income related to our contracts accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in our estimated costs at completion across our portfolio of contracts can have a significant effect upon our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods cumulative catchup operating income adjustments are presented in the table below 



cost reduction initiatives to increase our competitiveness contributed to the net favorable operating income adjustments our cost management activities have led to overall improved contract performance reflected in both increased favorable adjustments and lower unfavorable adjustments 

segment operating income 

segment operating income is defined as operating income less certain corporatelevel expenses that are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far and the net fascas pension difference 

northrop grumman corporation 

the table below shows the variances in segment operating income from the respective prior years 



2012  segment operating income in 2012   increased   121 million  or 4 percent  as compared to 2011  driven by a number of factors including improved performance particularly at electronic systems improved performance reflects mitigation of contract risks and cost reduction initiatives as well as portfolio shaping efforts the increase in segment operating margin rate reflects this improved segment performance on lower revenue 

2011  segment operating income in 2011   increased   45 million  or 1 percent  as compared to 2010  driven by improved program performance which more than offset the impact of lower sales 

net pension adjustment 

the net fascas pension adjustment in 2012   decreased   268 million  as compared to 2011  primarily due to increased gaap pension expense resulting from amortization of prior year actuarial losses and decreased cas pension expense allocated to the operating segments due to the design change in the companys defined benefit pension plans adopted in december 2011 the net fascas pension adjustment in 2011   increased   390 million  as compared to 2010  primarily due to decreased gaap pension expense primarily resulting from higher than estimated returns on a larger amount of pension plan assets as of the beginning of the year 

unallocated corporate expenses 

unallocated corporate expenses for 2012 were comparable with the prior year unallocated corporate expenses for 2011 decreased   16 million  or 9 percent  as compared with 2010 primarily due to a decrease in stockbased compensation 

interest expense 

interest expense declined in both 2012 and 2011 by 9 million  and 48 million  respectively as compared to the respective prior years the decrease from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate resulting from our debt refinancing in november 2010 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2012  – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2012 was 333 percent  as compared with 323 percent  in 2011 the higher effective tax rate reflects the change in net tax benefits related to the absence of research tax credits which expired at the end of 2011 although the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 extended the research tax credit through 2013 it was not enacted until january 2013 therefore the 2012 research credit will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013 

2011  – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2011 was 323 percent  as compared with 195 percent  in 2010 in 2010 we recognized net tax benefits of 298 million to reflect the final approval from the irs and the us congressional joint committee on taxation of the irs’ examination of our tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 

diluted earnings per share 

2012  – our diluted earnings per share increased  by 029  or 4 percent  the higher diluted earnings per share reflects the full impact of 2011 share repurchases which were largely purchased in the second half of 2011 the effect of our 2012 share repurchases and the higher segment operating income partially offset by lower earnings reflecting the lower net fascas pension adjustment 

2011  – our diluted earnings per share increased  by 070  or 10 percent  the higher diluted earnings per share reflects higher earnings and the effects of our share repurchases 

cash provided by continuing operations 

2012  – cash provided by continuing operations for 2012 was 26 billion  as compared with 23 billion  in 2011 cash provided by continuing operations reflects lower pension contributions partially offset by higher income taxes

paid in 2012 we contributed 367 million to our pension plans of which 300 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 11 billion in 2011 of which 10 billion was voluntarily prefunded 

2011  – cash provided by continuing operations in 2011 was 23 billion  as compared with 21 billion  in 2010 the increase in 2011 reflects lower tax payments timing of trade working capital and higher pension contributions in 2011 we contributed 11 billion to our pension plans of which 10 billion was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 789 million in 2010 of which 728 million was voluntarily prefunded 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned in four reportable segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems and technical services this section discusses sales segment operating income and operating margin rates by segment the reconciliation of segment sales to total sales is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 with the difference being intersegment sales eliminations the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income as well as a discussion of the reconciling items is included in the consolidated operating results section above for purposes of the discussion in this segment operating results section references to operating income and operating income margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate 

on january 1 2012 we transferred our missile business primarily the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program from the aerospace systems segment to our technical services segment the segment sales and segment operating income for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010 have been recast to reflect the missile business transfer sales of 494 million  and 474 million  and segment operating income of 44 million  and 43 million  were transferred from aerospace systems to technical services for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010 respectively 

for a more complete description of each segment’s products and services see the business descriptions in part i item 1 

aerospace systems 



2012  aerospace systems sales for 2012 were comparable to the prior year sales of unmanned systems increased approximately 280 million primarily related to ramping up on the nato alliance ground surveillance ags and fire scout programs additionally there was higher volume of approximately 200 million on the f35 program due to deliveries on lrip 5 the first f35 contract accounted for under the unitsofdelivery method these increases were offset by the termination of a weather satellite program which reduced sales by approximately 175 million as well as lower sales on the joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars fa18 and certain restricted space programs 

operating income and margin rate for 2012 were comparable to the prior year the operating income and margin rate reflect approximately 90 million lower operating income from the fa18 programs lower volume and transition from the multiyear 2 contract to the lower margin multiyear 3 contract principally offset by performance improvements in space systems and higher margin rates and volume on sales of unmanned systems 

2011  aerospace systems sales for 2011 decreased   472 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2010 the decrease was primarily due to approximately 430 million lower sales in space systems due to reduced funding for weather satellite programs and the james webb space telescope jwst as well as lower volume for several other space programs military aircraft systems declined approximately 130 million primarily due to lower volume on the f35 program which transitioned to a unitsofdelivery revenue recognition method beginning with low rate initial production lot 5 the completion of the aerial targets program and lower volume on ea18g growler offset by higher volume on long endurance multiintelligence vehicle lemv and jstars these decreases were partially offset by higher sales at advanced concepts and technology primarily due to increased volume on restricted programs 

northrop grumman corporation 

operating income for 2011 was comparable with the prior year and operating margin rate increased to 122 percent  from 116 percent  the increase is primarily due to improved performance across several programs at aerospace systems and lower amortization expense on purchased intangibles partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment for performance incentives on a space program and overall lower sales volume discussed above 

electronic systems 



2012  electronic systems sales for 2012 decreased   422 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2011 the decrease was largely due to lower volume of approximately 160 million on infrared countermeasures sales and approximately 250 million lower postal automation sales including approximately 150 million from our decision to deemphasize our domestic postal automation business these declines as well as declines due to troop draw down and reduced overseas contingency operations funding were partially offset by approximately 190 million higher volume on space programs 

operating income for 2012 increased   117 million  or 11 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 171 percent  from 145 percent  the higher operating income and operating margin rate reflect approximately 160 million of additional performance improvements over 2011 primarily on several combat avionics programs these performance improvements include the effect of unfavorable adjustments of approximately 50 million on a domestic postal automation program in the prior year that did not recur in 2012 

2011  electronic systems sales for 2011 decreased   241 million  or 3 percent  as compared with 2010 the decrease was primarily due to fewer deliveries on the large aircraft infrared countermeasures and vehicular intercommunications systems vis programs offset by increased volume on restricted programs 

operating income for 2011 increased   47 million  or 5 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 145 percent  from 134 percent  the higher operating income is primarily due to performance improvements on several contracts nearing completion in land  self protection systems and intelligence surveillance  reconnaissance programs the improved program performance was partially offset by reserves established in 2011 for reductions in workforce and a reserve on a program related to outstanding contractual issues as the contract nears completion and the overall lower sales volume described above 

information systems 



2012  information systems sales for 2012 decreased   565 million  or 7 percent  as compared with 2011 with no single program driving a significant portion the decline in sales reflects the termination or winddown on a number of programs including the joint tactical radio systems airborne maritime and fixed jtrs amf installation kits ikits enterprise network management enm and f22 programs partially offset by higher volume of approximately 110 million on the encore ii information technology support program as well as higher volume on the air and space operations center enterprise system development and ground combat vehicle programs further reducing sales was lower volume on restricted programs as well as the sale of the county of san diego it outsourcing contract and the sale of park air norway which together reduced sales by approximately 100 million as compared to 2011 

operating income for 2012 decreased   5 million  or 1 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 103 percent  from 97 percent  the higher operating margin rate is primarily driven by performance improvements across a number of contracts which largely offset the impact of lower volume on operating income 

2011  information systems sales for 2011 decreased   474 million  or 6 percent  as compared with 2010 the largest driver was lower sales for defense programs of 327 million principally attributed to reduced volume on force 

northrop grumman corporation 

protection security system saudi arabian american oil company netcents dko f22 and several other programs partially offset by higher volume on encore ii and trailer mounted support system programs the lower civil sales volume is primarily due to the sale of the county of san diego contract which reduced sales by 70 million as compared to the same period in 2010 lower volume on the enm program and completion of the treasury communications system program in 2010 

operating income for 2011 increased   10 million  or 1 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 97 percent  from 90 percent  the increase is primarily driven by improved performance on several civil programs including the virginia information technologies agency outsource contract and the effect of the sale of the county of san diego contract partially offset by the lower sales volume in defense programs described above 

technical services 



2012  technical services sales for 2012 decreased   174 million  or 5 percent  as compared with 2011 the decrease was primarily due to reduced volume from portfolio shaping of approximately 70 million as we focus our operations into core areas lower kc10 logistics activity of approximately 60 million and lower icbm logistics and modernization activity of approximately 50 million 

operating income for 2012 increased   8 million  or 3 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 89 percent  from 81 percent  the higher operating income and operating margin rate were primarily due to improved performance on the kc10 program partially offset by lower sales volume as described above 

2011  technical services sales for 2011 decreased   512 million  or 14 percent  as compared with 2010 the decrease is primarily due to 606 million lower sales in defense and government systems primarily due to the reduced participation in the nstec joint venture effective january 1 2011 the company reduced its participation in this joint venture and deconsolidated it resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture for 2011 compared with sales of 579 million in 2010 the decrease was partially offset by increased activity on the kc10 program which began in february 2010 

operating income for 2011 increased   11 million  or 4 percent  and operating margin rate increased to 81 percent  from 67 percent  the increase in operating margin rate is primarily due to effects of the change in participation in the nstec joint venture and performance improvements on several logistics and modernization and defense programs partially offset by unfavorable program performance on kc10 

product and service analysis 



 2012  product costs as a percentage of product sales decreased   90  basis points for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  this improvement reflects higher margins on combat avionics at electronic systems 

service costs as a percentage of service sales decreased   100  basis points for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  this improvement reflects higher service margins in all four business segments the 

northrop grumman corporation 

improvement is principally driven by higher margins on certain military aircraft programs at aerospace systems and an increase in favorable performance adjustments across a number of programs at electronic systems 

2011  product costs as a percentage of product sales decreased   180  basis points for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 2010  the decrease reflects performance improvements in various programs at aerospace systems and electronic systems and lower amortization expense on purchased intangibles at aerospace systems 

service costs as a percentage of service sales decreased   340  basis points for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 2010  the decrease reflects performance improvements in various programs at information systems and technical services the effect of the sale of the county of san diego contract at information systems and the change in participation in the nstec joint venture at technical services 

the following table presents sales and operating costs and expenses by segment between product and service 

 product sales and product costs 

2012  product sales in 2012 decreased  by 733 million  compared to 2011  primarily due to lower product sales at electronic systems and technical services partially offset by higher product sales at information systems the decrease at electronic systems primarily relates to lower volume of approximately 90 million in combat avionics and approximately 250 million in domestic and international postal automation programs the decline at technical services was due to the change in classification of the icbm program from product to service at the beginning of 2012 as the program transitioned from modernization to predominantly sustainment services the increase at information systems was primarily driven by higher intercompany volume 

product costs in 2012 decreased  by 725 million  compared to 2011  primarily due to lower sales volume and increased performance improvement adjustments at electronic systems and the change in classification of the icbm program at technical services offset by higher product volume at information systems as described above 

2011  product sales in 2011 decreased   10 billion  compared to 2010  primarily due to lower sales volume on space and military aircraft programs at aerospace systems and lower sales volume in land and self protection systems at electronic systems 

northrop grumman corporation 

product costs in 2011 decreased  by 981 million  compared to 2010  due to the decline in sales volume specifically aerospace systems sales decreased by approximately 600 million due to declines in space and military aircraft programs partially offset by sales increases in advanced concepts and technology 

service sales and service costs 

2012  service sales in 2012 decreased   415 million  compared to 2011  primarily due to lower service sales at information systems across a number of programs partially offset by the transitioning of the icbm program from product to service at technical services and higher service volume at electronic systems 

service costs in 2012 decreased   544 million  due to lower sales at information systems partially offset by the transitioning of the icbm program from product to service at technical services as described above and higher service volume at electronic systems the service activities at aerospace systems and electronic systems were at higher margin than the prior year resulting in service costs decreasing more than service sales 

2011  service sales in 2011 decreased   684 million  compared to 2010 primarily due to the reduced participation by technical services in the nstec joint venture resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture in 2011 compared to 579 million in 2010 and lower sales volume on defense and civil programs at information systems 

service costs in 2011 decreased   790 million  due to the overall decline in sales for the period and margin rate improvements at information systems technical services and electronic systems offset somewhat by an unfavorable margin rate change at aerospace systems contributing to the overall decline in revenues was the companys reduced participation in the nstec joint venture which resulted in the deconsolidation of this business in 2011 nstec contributed revenues of 579 million and segment cost of sales of 559 million in 2010 when it was included in technical services sales thus driving a 80 basis point improvement in margin rate for this segment more modest margin rate improvements at electronic systems and information systems effectively offset the decline in margin rate at the aerospace systems business 

backlog 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded for multiyear service contracts with nonus government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 

on january 1 2012 the company transferred its missile business previously reported in aerospace systems to technical services as a result of this realignment 599 million of backlog was transferred from aerospace systems to technical services total backlog as of december 31 2011 reflects this transfer 

backlog consisted of the following at december 31 2012 and 2011 



approximately 214  billion of the 408 billion  total backlog at december 31 2012  is expected to be converted into sales in 2013  total us government orders including those made on behalf of foreign governments comprised 82 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2012  international orders accounted for 12 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2012  domestic commercial backlog represented 6 percent of total backlog at the end of 2012  

new awards 

2012  – the estimated value of contract awards booked during 2012 is 265  billion significant new awards during 2012 include 17 billion for the nato ags unmanned system program 14 billion for the jwst program 13 billion for the f35 program 12 billion for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 10 billion for international air defense programs and 689 million for the global hawk program 

northrop grumman corporation 

2011  the estimated value of contract awards added to backlog during the year ended december 31 2011 is 253 billion significant new awards in 2011 included 20 billion for the fa18 program 11 billion for the e2d advanced hawkeye program 10 billion for the global hawk program 11 billion for the b2 program 886 million for the f35 program and 404 million for the kc10 program 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating earnings into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including but not limited to net cash provided by operations free cash flow net debttoequity and debttocapital we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance and condition 

cash balances and cash generated from continuing operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities andor in the capital markets if needed is expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months as of december 31 2012  the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was 580 million we do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations capital expenditure commitments at december 31 2012 of approximately 258 million  are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations 



 free cash flow from continuing operations 

free cash flow from continuing operations is defined as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful measure for investors to consider as it represents the cash flow the company has available after capital spending to invest for future growth strengthen the balance sheet andor return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases free cash flow is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions the payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

free cash flow from continuing operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow from continuing operations 



cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

northrop grumman corporation 

operating activities 

2012 –  cash provided by continuing operations in 2012 increased   293 million  as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower pension contributions partially offset by higher income taxes paid in 2012 we contributed 367 million to our pension plans of which 300 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 11 billion in 2011 of which 10 billion was voluntarily prefunded 

2011 –  cash provided by continuing operations in 2011 increased   291 million  as compared to 2010 primarily due to lower tax payments and changes in trade working capital partially offset by higher pension plan contributions in 2011 pension plan contributions totaled 11 billion of which 1 billion was voluntarily prefunded in 2010 pension plan contributions totaled 789 million of which 728 million was voluntarily prefunded 

investing activities 

2012 –  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 decreased   827 million  as compared to the cash provided by investing activities in 2011 reflecting a 14 billion contribution received from the spinoff of shipbuilding business in 2011 partially offset by 250 million in proceeds from the maturity of shortterm investments in 2012 that were purchased in 2011 

2011 –  cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations increased   13 billion  as compared to 2010 reflecting a 14 billion contribution received from the spinoff of shipbuilding business partially offset by 250 million net purchases of a shortterm investment in 2011 

financing activities 

2012 –  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2012 decreased   18 billion  as compared to 2011 reflecting approximately 980 million lower repurchases of common stock and 768 of debt repayments in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 

2011 –  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2011 increased   24 billion  as compared to 2010 reflecting approximately 11 billion higher repurchases of common stock and 15 billion of debt proceeds in 2010 

credit facilities 

in september 2011 the company entered into two senior unsecured credit facilities the credit agreements in an aggregate principal amount of 2 billion the first credit agreement is for 15 billion with a maturity date of september 2016 the second credit agreement was a 364day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million in september 2012 the company entered into a new 364day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million replacing the previous 500 million 364day revolving credit facility 

the credit agreements contain covenants which restrict the company’s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens the company also cannot permit the ratio of its consolidated debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreements to exceed 65 percent the company is in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements at december 31 2012  there was no balance outstanding under either of these credit facilities 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital  – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 

financial arrangements  – in the ordinary course of business the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations at december 31 2012  there were 193 million  of standby letters of credit 295 million  of bank guarantees and 168 million  of surety bonds outstanding

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

revenue recognition 

overview  – we derive the majority of our business from longterm contracts for development production and support activities for the us government these contracts are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors generally using the percentageofcompletion method accounting we classify contract revenues as product or service depending on the predominant attributes of the contract we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – the use of the percentageofcompletion method requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses most of our contracts use the costtocost method where revenue is calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract the unitsofdelivery measure recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values under both of these methods of percentageofcompletion accounting we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract at completion and recognize that profit as costs are incurred or as units are delivered 

certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination or for cost andor performance incentives these amounts are included in sales when they are reasonably estimable amounts representing unpriced change orders claims requests for equitable adjustment or recovery of costs in excess of limitations in funding are included in estimated contract revenue only when they are reliably estimable and realization is probable changes in estimates of contract revenues costs or profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods revenue and profit on future periods of contract performance are recognized as if the revised estimate had been used since contract inception if it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract the entire amount of the estimable future loss is charged against income in the period the loss is identified loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs and any remaining amount is reflected in liabilities 

northrop grumman corporation 

changes in contract estimates occur for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope changes in estimated revenue and changes in contract cost estimates these changes are often driven by events such as changes in estimated incentive fees unanticipated risks affecting contract costs the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated and changes in indirect cost allocations such as overhead and general and administrative expenses we employ an extensive contract management process involving several functional organizations and numerous personnel who are skilled at managing contract activities changes in estimates are frequent the company performs on a broad portfolio of longterm contracts many of which include complex and customized aerospace and electronic equipment and software that often includes technology at the forefront of science significant changes in estimates on a single contract could have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or annual results of operations and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings see the consolidating operating results section above and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineers program managers and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment factors that are considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability and cost of materials the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations we update our contract estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

impairment testing  – we perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill as of november 30th or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill should be evaluated when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of each of our four reporting units to their carrying values 

to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future consistent with our operating plans this income valuation method requires management to project revenues operating expenses working capital capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions 

the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

we also corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 

the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2012 indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

fair values for three of our four reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values as of our annual impairment testing on november 30 2012 at our other reporting unit information systems fair value exceeds carrying value by approximately five percent information systems carrying value includes goodwill of 53 

northrop grumman corporation 

billion  as of december 31 2012 we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer unresolved issues arising from these challenges include potential sequestration and action on the national debt ceiling potential contract cancellations or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues profits and cash flows to be lower than our current projections in addition marketbased inputs to the calculations in the impairment test such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could also be negatively impacted such circumstances may result in an impairment of our goodwill further the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors including the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability therefore an increase in the discount rate on our pension liability in 2013 or beyond could result in an impairment of goodwill absent any changes discussed above 

retirement benefits 

overview  – for financial statement purposes we account for our employee pension and other postretirement plans in accordance with gaap under fas we charge the costs of these plans to our contracts with customers in accordance with the far and the related cas that govern such plans in measuring periodic pension cost both fas and cas recognize a normal service cost component but there are differences in the way the remaining components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method including the assumptions and methods used for measuring the plan obligations as a result retiree benefit plan expense amounts for fas are different from the amounts for cas further differences result from dissimilar methodologies as to how estimated earnings on pension assets and interest expense on the pension obligations are measured and the periods over which gainslosses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are amortized cas pension expense is charged to contracts and included in segment operating income and the difference between the cas and fas pension expense is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level 

for fas purposes we perform an annual review of the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with our outside actuaries in the event that we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted or as a result of plan amendments future fas pension and postretirement benefit expense could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is determined using a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash outflows related to benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 412 percent  at december 31 2012 and 503 percent at december 31 2011 

the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required holding all other assumptions constant and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the 10 percent accounting corridor in 2012 an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2012 would have the following estimated effect to 



expected longterm rate of return –  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested for 2012 and 2011 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 825 percent and 85 percent respectively for 2013 pension and postretirement benefit plan purposes we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent and 733 percent 

northrop grumman corporation 

respectively holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return assumption for 2012 would have the following estimated effect to 



health care cost trend rate  – the health care cost trend rate represents the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants for the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we used a combination of market expectations and economic projections including the effect of health care reform to select an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 7 percent  for 2013 and 75 percent  for 2012 respectively additionally we expect an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent  to be reached in 2017 for both 2012 and 2011 although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 

a one percentagepoint change in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range would have had the following estimated effect on 2012 postretirement benefit results

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

customers and revenue concentration 

our primary customer is the us government revenue from the us government which includes foreign military sales – a method to sell us defense equipment services and training to foreign governments through the dod accounted for more than 90 percent of total revenues in each of 2011 2010 and 2009 no single product or service accounted for more than ten percent of total revenue during any period presented see risk factors in part i item 1a 

patents 

the following table summarizes the number of patents we own or have pending as of december 31 2011 

 

 patents developed while under contract with the us government may be subject to use by the us government we license intellectual property to and from third parties we believe our ability to conduct operations would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular intellectual property right see risk factors in part i item 1a 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal our revenue recognition timing is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs cost estimation and in some cases unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments – revenue recognition in part ii item 7

raw materials 

while we have generally been able to obtain key raw materials required in our production processes in a timely manner a significant delay in supply deliveries could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see risk factors in part i item 1a and overview – outlook in part ii item 7 

government contract regulation 

our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations including those relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in part i item 1a 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance if a us government contract were to be terminated for convenience we would generally be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in the unusual circumstance where a us government contract does not have such termination protection we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts see risk factors in part i item 1a 

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this form 10k reflect the operating results of restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

research and development 

our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs ird expenses are included in general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts companysponsored ird expenses totaled 543 million 580 million and 588 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively expenses for research and development sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related contracts 

employee relations 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our 72500 employees of which approximately 3400 are covered by 17 collective bargaining agreements we negotiated or renegotiated three of our collective bargaining agreements in 2011 and expect to renegotiate renewals for nine of our collective bargaining agreements in 2012 these negotiations had no material adverse effect on our results of operations for risks associated with collective bargaining agreements see risk factors in part i item 1a 

environmental matters 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment the estimated cost to complete remediation is accrued when it is probable that the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp by 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company taking into account the facts currently available to the company regarding each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances as of december 31 2011 management estimates the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation is 294 million to 752 million see risk factors in part i item 1a 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 amounts accrued for probable environmental remediation costs are 322 million and 313 million respectively we record accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which we believe it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated based on facts as then understood by us these accruals do not include any litigation costs nor do they include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations we record insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable a portion of the environmental remediation costs is expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on government contracts and accordingly such amounts are deferred in inventoried costs current portion and miscellaneous other assets noncurrent portion in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2011 and 2010 deferred environmental remediation costs totaled 191 million and 185 million respectively 

factors that could result in changes to the company’s estimates include but are not limited to modification of planned remedial actions increases or decreases in the estimated time required to remediate changes to the determination of responsible parties and their ability to pay changes in the level of estimated contamination changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements improvements in remediation technology and changes in estimated amounts recoverable through overhead charges on government contracts in addition there are some potential remediation sites where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including but not limited to those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” in 2009 we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 in 2010 we established goals for water usage and solid waste generation to comply with laws regulations and green initiatives including our goals we have incurred and expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time such costs have not had and we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we compete with many companies in the us defense industry and the information and services markets for a number of programs both large and small in the us defense industry lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company general dynamics corporation l3 communications corporation saic bae systems inc eads and finmeccanica spa are our primary competitors intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of our business and the defense industry it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not frequently found in other industries 

our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

needed to deliver those products and services affordably and efficiently like most of our competitors we are vertically integrated but also have a high reliance on the supply chain we must continue to maintain dependable sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this increasingly complex manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is vital to our success 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which are generally more labor intensive with highly competitive margin rates and contract performance periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with specialized expertise our ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors the most important factor is the ability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly we have implemented various workforce initiatives to enhance our success in attracting developing and retaining these skilled professionals in sufficient numbers to maintain or improve our competitive position within these markets 

in both the us defense industry and information and services markets the federal government has stressed competition and affordability in connection with its future procurement of products and services this may lead to fewer sole source awards as well as more emphasis on cost competitiveness in addition the dod has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities modify contract terms and enhance dod best practices including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors see overview and the economic opportunities challenges and risks sections in part ii item 7 as well as risk factors in part i item 1a these initiatives when implemented together with planned reductions in defense spending levels are likely to result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole with more demanding terms a reduced opportunity set is likely to intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs

 item1a risk factors tableend our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

 our primary customer is the us government from which we derived more than 90 percent of our total revenues during each of the past several years the federal government is implementing significant changes and reductions to government spending and other programs we cannot predict the impact on existing followon or replacement programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in defense spending levels military transformation and planning andor changes in socialpolitical priorities a shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe uncertainty and other concerns resulting from previously announced proposed defense spending reductions and potential additional reductions including under the budget control act of 2011 the budget control act have impacted and are likely to continue to impact the manner in which our us government customers manage programs andor make procurement decisions resulting in delays and reductions in payments and procurements similar challenges and uncertainty faced by some of our international government customers could also lead to delays andor reductions 

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for its convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in some circumstances however a us government contract does not have such termination protection in those cases we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means to the extent such means are unavailable or do not fully address the costs incurred or profit on those costs we could face significant losses from the termination for convenience of a contract that lacks termination protection termination by the us government of a contract for convenience could also result in the cancellation of future work on that program termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract as well as other damages termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to material liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts 

 

 the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend typically several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions as applicable the impact severity and duration of the current us economic situation and economic plans adopted or to be adopted by the us government along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in the event that government funding for any of our programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows

in august 2011 congress enacted the budget control act which while raising the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt also committed the us government to significantly reducing the federal deficit over ten years the budget control act established caps on discretionary spending through 2021 reducing federal spending by approximately 940 billion relative to the fiscal year 2012 presidential budget submission it also established a joint committee of congress the joint committee that was responsible for identifying an additional 12 to 15 trillion in deficit reductions by november 23 2011 the joint committee was unable to identify the additional deficit reductions by this deadline thereby triggering a second provision of the budget control act called “sequestration” which calls for very substantial automatic spending cuts split between defense and nondefense programs scheduled to start in 2013 and continue over a nineyear period while we believe efforts may be underway to prevent the automatic spending cuts scheduled to begin in 2013 the outcome of these efforts is uncertain and we are unable to predict the impact that either identified or automatic cuts would have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate is likely to be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs while we believe that our business is wellpositioned in areas that the dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending the impact of the budget control act remains uncertain and our business and industry could be materially adversely affected in january 2012 the secretary of defense announced a number of program changes and cancellations that are scheduled to take place over the next several years in part to comply with certain provisions of the budget control act certain of these program changes and cancellations are expected to have an impact on programs in which we participate 

 

 us government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements these regulations and requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs new regulations or procurement requirements including for example regarding counterfeit parts or changes to current ones could increase our costs and risks of compliance and reduce our margins 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the us government from time to time recommends to its contractors that certain contract prices be reduced or that costs allocated to certain contracts be disallowed these recommendations can involve substantial amounts in the past as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries we have on occasion reduced our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts 

we are also from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cost accounting 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

standards federal acquisition regulation far the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act if we are found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such matters could also result in suspension or debarment given our dependence on government contracting and authorizations suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending for example the dod’s better buying power initiative is designed to reduce costs gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods services and solutions from defense contractors in addition the dcaa has implemented cost recovery initiatives designed to prioritize efforts to recover costs and close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs are being challenged and refined 

these new initiatives have had and we expect them to continue to have a significant impact on the contracting environment in which we do business in support of the implementation of the better buying power initiative the us government is issuing a large number of new regulations and statutory requirements which are shifting additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor this is also being accomplished by the government’s increased reliance on the use of fixed price incentive contracts with specifically identified fee share line structures rather than cost type or fixed price contracts while the full impact to our business as a result of these changes remains uncertain and subject to the manner in which they are implemented our business and industry could be materially adversely affected 

 

 we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities or be able to assume lower costs than we do in some areas or programs we have seen and anticipate that we will continue to see increased competition in some of our core markets especially as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies and fewer new program starts in addition as discussed in more detail above projected us defense spending levels for periods beyond the nearterm are uncertain and difficult to predict changes in us defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities we are also facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also experiencing an increasing number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in the award decision being overturned and a rebid of the contract even where a bid protest does not result in a new award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and delay potential earnings 

 

 many of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success in the competitive 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees failure to maintain a qualified workforce could result in difficulty in performing under our contracts 

approximately 3400 of our 72500 employees are covered by an aggregate of 17 collective bargaining agreements and we expect to negotiate or renegotiate renewals for nine of our collective bargaining agreements in 2012 collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements if we experience such difficulties we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

 we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected we have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future for example such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to a variety of reasons including technical challenges manufacturing difficulties or delays or workforcerelated issues and where initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timelines and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and quality of their products the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete including additional pensionrelated costs that may arise from the new rule published by the cost accounting standards cas board discussed further in the pension and medical expenses risk factor below a significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our risk varies with the type of contract flexibly priced contracts include both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts due to their nature firm fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts in 2011 approximately 41 percent of our annual revenues were derived from firm fixedprice contracts we typically enter into firm fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in our contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our firm fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of firm fixedprice development contracts that include production units is subject to our ability to control some cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 

under a typical fixedprice incentive contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability under a costtype contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee that represents profit we typically enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

 

 when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor complexity of the work to be performed cost and availability of materials impact of delayed performance and timing of product deliveries contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete a contract since costs also include expected increases in wages prices for materials and allocated fixed costs similarly assumptions are made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts future period financial reporting and performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

 we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations on time as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

our costs may increase over the term of our contracts through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these provisions a significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us government consistent with the industry’s efforts our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit parts or materials there are currently several components for which there may only be one supplier the inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs or the appearance of counterfeit parts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in economic conditions as well as changes in the defense budget can adversely affect the ability of our subcontractors and suppliers to perform and further increase this risk 

 

 goodwill accounts for approximately half of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill amounts for impairment at least annually or more often when we believe potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets 

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates and we may experience unforeseen issues that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets 

 

 while our international business is not substantial it remains subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by us our employeesor others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

suspension of our export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on us changes in regulation or political environment may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including those regarding investment procurement and repatriation of earnings our international business may also be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and may be further impacted by global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific incountry purchases investments manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations known as offset obligations and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements 

the services and products we provide internationally including those provided by subcontractors are sometimes in countries with unstable governments in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of an incident resulting in harm or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties or damage to our products we maintain insurance and take other steps to mitigate the risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations but these steps may not be adequate to prevent loss or to cover resulting claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs see additional discussion of possible inadequacy of our insurance coverage below in addition any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity for the company which may adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or attract and retain employees or result in the loss of existing and future contracts the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 we have implemented extensive policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent misconduct by employees agents or others with whom we are doing business that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing improper payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents or others with whom we are doing business such improper actions could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension and debarmentthat could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 as a defense contractor we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information threats to the safety of our directors officers and employees threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure and threats from terrorist acts although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing if any of these events were to materialize they could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities harm to personnel or infrastructure or damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

cybersecurity threats are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

we also manage information technology systems for various customers and other third parties while we operate under information security policies and procedures for managing these systems we generally face similar cybersecurity threats for these systems as for our own 

 

 our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions commonly referred to as “green initiatives” compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs 

environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may limit our operations or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration the listing could continue until the epa concludes that the cause of the violation had been corrected if we were listed on the excluded parties list it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows listed facilities generally cannot be used in performing any us government contract until the violation is corrected 

the adoption of new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts sanctions or penalties could negatively impact our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 the size type and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are and may become subject to various environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims investigations and administrative civil or criminal litigation which could divert financial and management resources and could lead to fines penalities judgements and other monetary and nonmonetary results including suspension or debarment and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any investigation claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

 

 we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property the us government has certain rights to use certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use certain such intellectual property our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

 

 we have significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to earthquakes damaging storms and other natural disasters including environmental disasters although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract this could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer could result in a termination of the prime contract and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

natural disasters could also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance 

 

 we endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example a catastrophic earthquake claim 

additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time merge with or acquire businesses dispose of or spinoff businesses form joint ventures or create strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies the management of the operations and market conditions following these transactions accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges liabilities amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets guarantees partner performance and indemnifications divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through guarantees indemnifications or other financial arrangements following the transaction although we have established procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

 domestic and international financial and credit markets have experienced high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers historically we have occasionally accessed these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions capital expansion projects refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit in the future we may not be able to obtain capital market financing or bank financing when needed on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we have also executed transactions with counterparties domestically and abroad in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of counterparty default 

a tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers 

 

 a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally due to government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our government contracts occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made these timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations on december 27 2011 the cas board published a final rule intended to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 we anticipate that this rule will better align but not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts the rule becomes effective february 27 2012 with 2013 being the first year of applicability for the revised accounting practices required by the rule price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 will reflect the effects of the rule although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cas covered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule on our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many

transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of income from contracts for financial statement purposes and for income tax regulations can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on our cash flow from operations in a particular period furthermore changes in applicable domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

 

 our nuclearrelated operations subject us to various risks including potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclearrelated operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials we are also subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control the us government and prime contractors provide certain indemnity protection under certain of our contracts pursuant to or in connection with public law 85804 and the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act for certain nuclearrelated risks if there was a nuclear incident and that indemnity protection was not available to cover our losses and liabilities it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 in connection with the spinoff of our former shipbuilding business we received a letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of counsel confirming that we and our shareholders would not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger the internal reorganization or the distribution except that our shareholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares would recognize gain or loss with respect to such cash the ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us and hii regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters 

we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the opinion to be incomplete or untrue at the time of the spinoff transaction nevertheless if the irs determines that any of the factual statements or representations that the irs ruling or the opinion was based on were incomplete or untrue or if certain facts or circumstances upon which the irs ruling or the opinion was based were materially different from those at the time of the spinoff we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

even if the spinoff transaction otherwise qualifies as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the internal reorganization and distribution may be taxable to us but not to our shareholders if certain events occur including if within two years following the spinoff there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either us or hii representing 50 or more of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution we cease to engage appropriately in the conduct of a substantial part of our existing business or we or hii repurchase shares in excess of specified levels over a twoyear period which substantially exceed 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

our historical repurchase activity level if such tax were incurred the tax liability would be substantial hii has agreed not to undertake transactions that would reasonably be expected to trigger such tax and we intend to avoid any such transactions 

 

 in connection with the spinoff transaction we entered into a number of agreements with hii setting forth certain rights and obligations of the parties after the separation for example under the separation and distribution agreement from and after the spinoff transaction each of hii and northrop grumman is generally responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the consummation of the spinoff it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and hii and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to hii for example tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if hii were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations 

in addition third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities or obligations for which hii has agreed to be responsible andor to indemnify us the indemnity rights we have under our agreements with hii may not be sufficient to protect us against such liabilities even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hii any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to record these losses ourselves until such time as the indemnity contribution is paid in addition certain indemnities that we may be required to provide hii are not subject to a cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business these risks could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

significant financial events for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 other notable events for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

  

 political and economic environment 

the us and global economies have experienced a period of substantial economic uncertainty and turmoil with high levels of national debt and the related financial markets have been characterized by significant volatility 

current levels of deficit spending in the us could prove to be unsustainable over the long term although defense spending is expected to remain a national priority within future federal budgets the passage of the budget control act of 2011 the budget control act in august 2011 marked a growing political acceptance of cutting planned defense spending as part of a deficit reduction solution some allied government defense spending has also come under increasing pressure as governments search for ways to reduce their deficits and national debts 

the administration and congress will likely continue to debate the size of the new defense budget plan for the next decade but spending over the next several years is expected to drop measurably from previously planned levels absent a significant national security event future defense plans and changes in defense spending levels could adversely affect the individual programs and delay purchasing by our customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations andor cash flows while these significant budgetary considerations put downward pressure on growth in our industry we believe that our business is well positioned in areas that the dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending to help the dod meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting us security and the security of our allies in the years to come 

the budget control act raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt and committed the us government to reduce significantly the federal deficit in the coming decade the budget control act consists of two parts both of which could impact future defense spending levels the first part mandates a total reduction of 940 billion to the fiscal year 2012 presidential budget submission as part of established caps on discretionary spending through 2021 of this total reduction approximately 490 billion is expected to come from defense spending the budget control act also set up a joint committee of congress the joint committee that 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

was responsible for identifying an additional 12 to 15 trillion in deficit reductions by november 23 2011 the joint committee was unable to identify the additional deficit reductions by this deadline thereby triggering a second provision of the budget control act called “sequestration” which calls for very substantial automatic spending cuts split between defense and nondefense programs that will start in 2013 and continue over a nineyear period both the administration and many members of congress have indicated that sequestration is not the preferred path to deficit reduction and that alternative steps should be pursued while we believe efforts may be underway to prevent the automatic spending cuts scheduled to begin in 2013 the outcome of these efforts is uncertain 

the fiscal year 2012 defense budget provides a nominal increase in base funding over fiscal year 2011 levels we anticipate continued debate over defense spending with the president’s budget request for fiscal year 2013 and the subsequent congressional budget process the forthcoming general election in november is expected to generate significant additional political dialogue centered around the federal deficit and potential cuts in government spending budget decisions made in this environment could have longterm consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 

we expect us force levels and budget resources tied to current hostilities to continue to draw down as overall defense spending is reduced the dod is reevaluating the role and structure of the military the dod recently released a new defense strategy that resulted from a comprehensive review intended to guide its priorities and budgeting decisions the new guidance indicates the us military needs to project power globally and operate effectively in all domains including cybersecurity and it places particular emphasis on the asia pacific region as an area of strategic focus 

in january 2012 the secretary of defense announced a number of program changes and cancellations that are scheduled to take place over the next several years in part to comply with certain provisions of the budget control act certain of these program changes and cancellations will have an impact on programs in which we participate 

the us is expected to continue to maintain a range of powerful military capabilities to support us national security interests even amidst economic difficulties and reductions in defense spending levels and consequently we expect the us will continue to need many of the sophisticated capabilities that we provide we believe our portfolio aligns well with the dod’s indicated requirements and as a result we believe we are well positioned to help the dod meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting us security in the years ahead 

although reductions to individual programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete are always possible such as the recent announcements regarding the block 30 global hawk and f35 programs we believe that spending on recapitalization modernization and maintenance of defense intelligence and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms given the current era of irregular warfare we expect increased investment in persistent awareness with intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems cyber warfare and an expansion of information available for the warfighter to make timely decisions we expect other significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike directed energy applications missile defense satellite communications systems restricted programs cybersecurity technical services and information technology contracts and numerous international and homeland security programs 

we believe that the us government will continue to place a high priority on defense spending and national security as well as economic challenges and will continue to invest in sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management precision strike and strategic agility in addition the us government continues to face challenges with recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness while also pursuing modernization and reducing overhead and inefficiency

cybersecurity 

our industry and the broader national security community are subject to various cybersecurity threats including but not limited to attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information we proactively work to assess and mitigate the evolving risks in addition we have partnered with various industry and government participants including the dod to collaborate around increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats see risk factors located in part i item 1a for a more complete description of the risks that we face due to security threats including cybersecurity threats 

green initiatives 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including but not limited to those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” in 2009 we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 in 2010 we established goals for water usage and solid waste generation to comply with laws regulations and green initiatives including our goals we have incurred and expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time such costs have not had and we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

business dispositions 

2011 – we completed the spinoff to our shareholders of hii effective march 31 2011 hii operates the business that was previously the shipbuilding segment shipbuilding of the company prior to the spinoff the spinoff was the culmination of the company’s decision to explore strategic alternatives for shipbuilding as it was determined to be in the best interests of shareholders customers and employees to allow both the company and shipbuilding to pursue more effectively their respective opportunities to maximize value we made a pro rata distribution to our shareholders of one share of hii common stock for every six shares of our common stock held on the record date of march 30 2011 or 488 million shares of hii common stock there was no gain or loss recognized by the company as a result of the spinoff transaction in connection with the spinoff hii issued senior notes and entered into a credit facility with thirdparty lenders and hii used a portion of the proceeds of the notes and credit facility to fund a 14 billion cash contribution to us sales for shipbuilding for the three months ended march 31 2011 were 16 billion and sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 were 67 billion and 62 billion respectively the assets liabilities and operating results of this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

2009 – we sold our advisory services division asd in december 2009 for 165 billion in cash to an investor group led by general atlantic llc and affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp and recognized a gain of 15 million net of taxes asd was a business unit comprised of the assets and liabilities of tasc inc its wholly owned subsidiary tasc services corporation and certain contracts carved out from other businesses also in information systems that provide systems engineering technical assistance seta and other analysis and advisory services sales for asd in the year ended december 31 2009 was approximately 15 billion

discontinued operations  – earnings for the businesses classified within discontinued operations for the dispositions discussed above were as follows 

 

 contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm government contracts for development production and support activities government contracts typically include the following major cost elements material labor overhead subcontract costs and general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

flexibly priced contracts – flexibly priced contracts include both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs up to a ceiling amount but are subject to a costshare limit that affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

firm fixedprice contracts – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor timeandmaterials contracts are considered firm fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

the following table summarizes 2011 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

   

northrop grumman corporation 

  

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against negotiated criteria award fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract award fee contracts are used in certain of our operating segments 

compliance and monitoring  – we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations and laws in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

revenue recognition 

overview  – we derive the majority of our business from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contract we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant gaap revenue recognition principles 

we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms under percentageofcompletion accounting we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on each contract’s percentageofcompletion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method requires us to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge of our engineers program managers and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as we believe a reasonable estimate can be made 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

certain service contracts  – we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in technical services and information systems we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap guidance for revenue arrangements with multipleelements accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge of our engineers program managers and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations andor cash flows we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

purchase accounting 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

acquisition accruals  – we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals are determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment we record these accruals based on our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of november 30th or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets should be evaluated intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 

to determine the fair value of our reporting units we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future this income valuation method requires management to project revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period as well as determine the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and the terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis we also corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings when calculating impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives we compare the fair value of these assets as determined based on the income and market valuation methods to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2011 indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a range of claims investigations lawsuits environmental matters income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we determine whether to record a charge to earnings and if so what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us including any settlement offers and our assessment of the probability of the liabilities and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us when we believe based on the facts available to us that a liability is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable we record our best estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss when a range of costs is reasonably estimable but no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record what we estimate as the lower end of the range for further information on the treatment of these contingencies see note 1 note 14 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

us government cost claims 

from time to time our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs when such findings are presented we engage us government representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed where appropriate provisions are made to reflect our expected exposure to matters raised by the us government representatives 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

income taxes 

provisions for federal foreign state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes state and local income and franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process and accordingly are included in operating income 

uncertain tax positions – tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period it is determined the company recognizes federal interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense federal penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

retirement benefits 

overview – we record our employee pension and other postretirement plans in accordance with us gaap under financial accounting standards fas and charge the costs of these plans to our contracts with customers in accordance with the far and the related cost accounting standards cas that govern such plans in measuring periodic pension cost both fas and cas recognize a normal services cost component but there are differences in the way the remaining components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method including the assumptions and methods used for measuring the plan obligations as a result retiree benefit plan expense amounts for fas purposes are different from the amounts for cas purposes further differences result from different methodologies in how estimated earnings on pension assets and interest expense on the pension obligations are measured and the measurement and allocation periods over which gainslosses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are determined cas pension expense is allocated to our segments and is included in their measurement of segment operating income and the difference between the cas and fas pension expense is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level 

recent developments in us government cost accounting standards pension recovery rules  – on december 27 2011 the cas board published a final rule revising cas 412 “composition and measurement of pension cost” and cas 413 “adjustment and allocation of pension cost” these revisions are intended to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa as amended by the pension protection act ppa of 2006 we anticipate that the rule will better align but not eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts under the final rule there is a fiveyear transition period during which an increasing percentage of the harmonization effect is to be recognized starting from 0 in the first year to 100 in the fifth year and thereafter the rule becomes effective february 27 2012 with 2013 being the first year of applicability for the revised accounting practices required by the rule price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 will reflect the effects of the rule we believe for cas covered contracts awarded prior to the effective date contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional cas basis contract costs resulting from implementation of the final rule 

fas benefit plan assumptions  – we perform an annual evaluation of the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with our outside actuaries in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined using a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 503 percent at december 31 2011 and 575 percent at december 31 2010 holding all other assumptions constant and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the 10 percent accounting corridor in 2011 an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2011 would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2011 by approximately 77 million of which 2 million relates to postretirement benefits and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december 31 2011 by approximately 800 million of which 55 million relates to postretirement benefits the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2011 and 2010 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return assumption for 2011 holding all other assumptions constant would increase or decrease our pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2011 by approximately 52 million of which 2 million relates to postretirement benefits for 2012 pension and postretirement benefit plan purposes we have assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 825 percent 

health care cost trend rates – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants using a combination of market expectations and economic projections including the effect of health care reform we selected an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 75 percent for 2012 and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2017 in 2010 we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 8 percent for 2011 and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2017 although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2011 postretirement benefit results

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

 

 operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs two or more closelyrelated contracts generally obtained from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described above in part ii item 7 as indicated in our discussion on “contracts” above in part ii item 7 our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance due to far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing engineering and design labor costs subcontractor costs material costs overhead costs and general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract costs which is the key driver of both revenue and operating income 

in any given reporting period each of our segments manages numerous contracts that provide for the delivery of products or services to our customers our contract management process involves the use of contract estimatesatcompletion eacs that are generally prepared and evaluated on a bottomsup basis at least annually and reviewed on a quarterly basis over the performance period of the contract these eacs include an estimated contract operating income margin rate based initially on the contract award amount adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance these risks typically include technical risk schedule risk and performance risk based upon our evaluation of the contract effort similarly the eacs include identified opportunities for operating income margin rate improvement over the performance period of the contract our program management organizations perform recurring evaluations of contract performance and adjust the contract revenue and cost estimates over the life of the contract to reflect the latest reliable information available our business and program management organizations are comprised of a large cadre of skilled professional managers who utilize our contract administration and management control systems with the objective of successfully overseeing our contract performance to satisfy the customer’s expectations deliver high quality products and services and manage contract risks and opportunities to achieve an appropriate operating income margin rate on the contract our comprehensive business and contract management process involves personnel from the planning production control contracts cost management supply chain and program and business management functions as part of this overall contract management function these personnel monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and compliance with u s government regulations as a result contract operating income and periodtoperiod contract operating income margin rates are adjusted over the contract performance period to reflect changes in the risks and opportunities affecting the contract and adjustments may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on operating income margin depending upon the specific conditions affecting each contract 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues and operating income including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap where applicable unusual fluctuations in operating performance attributable to changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations generally focuses around our four segments versus distinguishing between products and services 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

 

 2011 – sales and service revenues for 2011 decreased 1731 million or 6 percent as compared to 2010 reflecting lower sales at all four operating segments 

product sales for 2011 decreased 1018 million or 6 percent as compared to 2010 primarily due to lower sales volume on space and manned aircraft programs at aerospace systems and lower sales volume in land and self protection systems at our electronic systems segment service revenues for 2011 decreased 713 million or 6 percent as compared to 2010 primarily due to the reduced participation by the technical services segment in the nstec joint venture effective january 1 2011 resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture in 2011 compared to 579 million in 2010 and lower sales volume on defense and civil systems at the information systems segment 

2010 – sales and service revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 493 million or 2 percent as compared to 2009 reflecting higher sales at aerospace systems and technical services partially offset by lower sales at information systems and electronic systems 

product sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 87 million or 1 percent as compared to 2009 primarily due to sales growth in aerospace systems partially offset by lower product sales in electronic systems and information systems service revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 406 million or 3 percent as compared to 2009 primarily due to sales growth in technical services largely related to the kc10 contractor logistics support kc10 program

the first table below presents cost of sales and service revenues and general and administrative expenses on a consolidated basis while the second table presents our cost of sales and service revenues on a segmentbysegment basis and with the impact of nonsegment factors 

cost of sales and service revenues and general administrative expenses 1 

 

  

   

northrop grumman corporation 

  

for ease of understanding the items that drive changes in our consolidated cost of sales we have presented below an analysis of sales and cost of sales by segment and the nonsegment factors that impact our consolidated amounts 

cost of sales elements by segment and nonsegment factors 

 

 cost of segment product sales 

2011 – cost of segment product sales in 2011 decreased by 981 million and a 60 basis point reduction as a percentage of product sales as compared to 2010 due to the overall decline in sales for the period across all of the segments other than technical services aerospace systems’ sales volume declined by 600 million largely due to sales declines in space systems 388 million and strike  surveillance systems 255 million partially offset by sales increases in battle management  engagement systems and advanced programs  technology approximately 90 million each margin rates improved at aerospace systems by 90 basis points primarily due to net favorable performance improvements on programs and lower amortization of purchased intangibles in 2011 sales volume at electronic systems decreased 369 million largely due to lower volume in the land  self protection and navigation systems business areas margin rates at electronic systems remained consistent in 2011 primarily due to performance improvements on programs nearing completion in the land  self protection and intelligence and surveillance business areas offset by provisions for workforce reductions 

2010 – cost of segment product sales of 147 billion in 2010 was flat versus 2009 consistent with the relatively flat yearoveryear segment sales cost of product sales at aerospace systems increased due to sales volume increases at strike and surveillance of 218 million and battle management and engagement systems of 517 million offset by volume decreases at the advanced programs  technology business area of 315 million 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

product sales at information systems decreased in volume by approximately 22 primarily due to 210 million in sales volume that transitioned from product to service activity in 2010 electronic systems product sales volume decreased 133 million during the period and product cost of sales decreased by 163 million reflecting performance improvement in land and self protection programs higher volume in targeting systems and lower operating loss provisions in postal automation programs 

cost of segment service revenues 

2011 – cost of service revenues in 2011 decreased by 789 million and 130 basis points as a percentage of service revenues as compared to 2010 due to the overall decline in sales for the period and margin rate improvements at information systems technical services and electronic systems offset somewhat by an unfavorable margin rate change at aerospace systems contributing to the overall decline in revenues was the company’s participation in the nstec joint venture which resulted in the deconsolidation of this business in 2011 nstec contributed revenues of 579 million and segment cost of sales of 559 million in 2010 when it was included in technical service’s sales thus driving a 80 basis point improvement in margin rate for this segment more modest margin rate improvements at electronic systems and information systems effectively offset the decline in margin rate at the aerospace systems business 

2010 – cost of segment service revenues of 123 billion in 2010 was up over 2009 by 321 million due to increased volume which resulted in an increase in sales from 128 billion in 2009 to 134 billion in 2010 the sales volume increase was due principally to technical services’ contract volume driven by the kc10 and c20 contracts which together increased by 307 million segment service margin rates across all segments improved in 2010 with information systems being the primary contributor as it experienced higher margin rates at its civil systems division and due to the absence of nonrecurring costs of 37 million from the sale of asd in 2009 overall information systems experienced a 186 basis point margin rate improvement 

unallocated corporate expenses 

unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules and therefore not allocated to the segments such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses unallocated corporate expenses for 2011 decreased 16 million or 9 percent as compared with 2010 primarily due to a decrease in stockbased compensation unallocated corporate expenses for 2010 increased 82 million or 82 percent as compared with 2009 primarily due to inclusion of a 64 million net gain from a legal settlement in 2009 as well as an increase in environmental health and welfare and stockbased compensation expenses in 2010 

net pension adjustment 

net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expenses determined in accordance with gaap and pension expense allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance with cas for 2011 and 2010 the net pension adjustment resulted in income of 400 million and 10 million respectively the increase in net pension adjustment for both years is due to decreased gaap pension expense primarily resulting from higher estimated returns on higher pension plan assets as of the beginning of the year 

royalty income adjustment 

royalty income is included in segment operating income and reclassified to other income for financial reporting purposes 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts for most components of the company these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors therefore include this cost component as an element of cost general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2011 – general and administrative expenses for 2011 decreased 117 million or 5 percent compared to 2010 primarily due to overall reductions in administrative costs due to cost reduction initiatives lower bid and proposal costs and lower research and development expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues was 9 percent for 2011 consistent with 2010 

2010 – general and administrative expenses for 2010 decreased 104 million or 4 percent compared to 2009 primarily due to the disposition of asd in 2009 at information systems the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily due to cost reductions realized from the 2009 streamlining of our organizational structure which reduced the number of operating segments 

interest expense 

2011 – interest expense for 2011 decreased 48 million as compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate resulting from our debt refinancing in november 2010 

2010 – interest expense in 2010 was comparable to 2009 

charge on debt redemption 

2010 – in november 2010 we repurchased outstanding debt and recorded a pretax charge of 229 million as other expense primarily related to premiums paid on the debt tendered see liquidity and capital resources below and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2011 – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2011 was 323 percent as compared with 195 percent in 2010 in 2010 we recognized net tax benefits of 298 million to reflect the final approval from the irs and the us congressional joint committee on taxation joint committee of the irs’ examination of our tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 

2010 – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2010 was 195 percent compared with 307 percent in 2009 in 2010 we recognized net tax benefits of 298 million to reflect the final approval of the irs’s examination of our tax returns for years 2004 through 2006 as discussed above in 2009 we recognized net tax benefits of 75 million primarily as a result of a final settlement with the irs office of appeals and the joint committee related to our tax returns for years ended 2001 through 2003 

excluding the effects of the 298 million net tax benefit in 2010 and the 75 million net tax benefit in 2009 our effective tax rates would have been 321 percent and 343 percent in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cash provided by operating activities 

2011 – cash provided by continuing operations in 2011 was 23 billion as compared with 21 billion in 2010 and reflects lower tax payments and timing of trade working capital in 2011 we contributed 11 billion to our pension plans of which 10 billion was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 789 million in 2010 of which 728 million was voluntarily prefunded income taxes paid net of refunds was 810 million in 2011 as compared with 11 billion in 2010 cash provided by continuing operations for 2011 included 30 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 9 million of interest income received 

2010 – cash provided by continuing operations in 2010 was 21 billion as compared with 2 billion in 2009 and reflects higher cash paid to our suppliers offset by lower tax payments primarily due to 508 million for taxes paid in 2009 related to the sale of asd in 2010 we contributed 789 million to our pension plans of which 728 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 657 million in 2009 of which 601 million was voluntarily prefunded income taxes paid net of refunds was 11 billion in 2010 as compared with 13 billion in 2009 cash provided by continuing operations for 2010 included 94 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 11 million of interest income received

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into four reportable segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems and technical services see note 7 in part ii item 8 for more information about our segments 

in january 2010 we transferred our internal information technology services unit from the information systems segment to our corporate shared services group the intersegment sales and operating income for this unit that were previously recognized in the information systems segment are immaterial and have been eliminated for the years presented 

 

  

 key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues incurred due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding operating income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation costs and other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far and therefore not allocated to the segments changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance 

performance refers to changes in contract margin rates for the period these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative catchup basis at the time an eac change is recorded we identify favorable and unfavorable adjustments to determine our qualitative discussion of performance results and where meaningful we disclose the effects of such adjustments on a contract or program basis 

operating income may also be affected by among other things the effects of workforce stoppages natural disasters such as earthquakes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are meaningful a separate description is provided 

changes in estimates related to our contracts accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method are recorded using the cumulative catchup method of accounting the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes across our portfolio of numerous contracts can have a significant effect upon our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods in 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized favorable operating income adjustments of 11 billion 945 million and 758 million and unfavorable operating income adjustments of 385 million 270 million and 337 million respectively consisting of cumulative catchup adjustments from the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting

aerospace systems 

 

 sales and service revenues 

2011 – aerospace systems revenue decreased 452 million or 4 percent as compared with 2010 the decrease is primarily due to 388 million lower sales in space systems ss and 255 million lower sales in strike  surveillance systems sss partially offset by 90 million higher sales in battle management  engagement systems bmes and 87 million higher sales in advanced programs  technology apt the lower sales at ss are primarily due to reduced funding for weather satellite programs and the james webb space telescope jwst as well as lower volume for several other space programs the lower sales at sss are primarily due to lower volume on the f35 lightning ii f35 manned aircraft program which transitioned to a unitsofdelivery revenue recognition method beginning with low rate initial production lot 5 and the completion of the aerial targets program the higher sales at bmes are primarily due to higher volume on long endurance multiintelligence vehicle lemv and joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars partially offset by lower volume on ea18g the higher sales at apt are primarily due to increased volume on restricted programs 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2010 – aerospace systems revenue increased 491 million or 5 percent as compared with 2009 the increase is primarily due to 517 million higher sales in bmes and 218 million higher sales in sss partially offset by 315 million lower sales in apt the increase at bmes is due to higher sales volume on the broad area maritime surveillance bams unmanned aircraft system ea6b ea18g e2 hawkeye and lemv programs the increase at sss is primarily due to higher sales volume associated with manned and unmanned aircraft programs such as the global hawk highaltitude longendurance hale systems the f35 b2 stealth bomber and fa18 partially offset by the termination of the kinetic energy interceptor kei program in 2009 and decreased activity on the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program the decrease at apt is primarily due to lower sales volume on restricted programs and the navy unmanned combat air system nucas program 

segment operating income 

2011 – aerospace systems operating income increased 5 million or less than 1 percent as compared with 2010 the increase is primarily due to improved performance across several programs at aerospace systems and lower amortization expense on purchased intangibles partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment for performance incentives on a space program at ss and overall lower sales volume discussed above 

2010 – aerospace systems operating income increased 185 million or 17 percent as compared with 2009 and as a percentage of sales increased 120 basis points the increase is primarily due to net performance improvements across various programs principally within ss and the higher sales volume discussed above 

electronic systems 

 

 sales and service revenues 

2011 – electronic systems revenue decreased 241 million or 3 percent as compared with 2010 the decrease was primarily due to 325 million lower sales in land  self protection systems partially offset by 65 million higher sales in advanced concepts  technologies act the lower sales in land  self protection systems are primarily due to fewer deliveries on large aircraft infrared countermeasures laircm and vehicular intercommunications systems vis programs the higher sales in act are primarily due to increased volume on restricted programs 

2010 – electronic systems revenue decreased 58 million or less than 1 percent as compared with 2009 the decrease is primarily due to 150 million lower sales in land  self protection systems 84 million lower sales in intelligence surveillance  reconnaissance isr systems and 82 million lower sales in naval  marine systems partially offset by 186 million higher sales in targeting systems and 72 million higher sales in advanced concepts  technologies the decrease in land  self protection systems is due to lower sales volume on the groundair task oriented radar gator program as it transitions from the development phase to the integration and test phase and lower unit deliveries on the vis program the decrease in isr systems is due to lower sales volume on the space based infrared systems sbirs program as it transitions to followon production postal automation programs and various international programs the decrease in naval  marine systems is due to lower volume on the shipboard cobra judy replacement radar program the increase in targeting systems is due to higher sales volume on the f35 various laser systems and restricted programs and increased unit deliveries of the litening targeting pod system the increase in advanced concepts  technologies is primarily due to volume on restricted programs 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

segment operating income 

2011 – electronic systems operating income increased 47 million or 5 percent as compared to 2010 and as a percentage of sales increased 110 basis points the higher operating income is primarily due to performance improvements on several contracts nearing completion in land  self protection systems and intelligence surveillance  reconnaissance programs the improved program performance was partially offset by reserves established in 2011 for reductions in workforce and a reserve on a program related to outstanding contractual issues as the contract nears completion and overall lower sales volume described above 

2010 – electronic systems operating income increased 54 million or 6 percent as compared with 2009 the increase is primarily due to net performance improvements in land and self protection programs higher volume in targeting systems and lower operating loss provisions in postal automation programs 

information systems 

 

 sales and service revenues 

2011 – information systems revenue decreased 474 million or 6 percent as compared with 2010 the decrease is primarily due to 327 million lower sales in defense systems and 99 million lower sales in civil systems the decrease in defense systems is primarily due to lower sales volume from force protection security system fps2 saudi arabian american oil company aramco netcents dko f22 and several other programs partially offset by higher volume on encore ii and trailer mounted support system tmss programs the lower sales volume in civil systems is primarily due to the sale of the county of san diego contract which reduced sales by 70 million as compared to the same period in 2010 lower volume on the enterprise network management program and completion of the treasury communications system program in 2010 

2010 – information systems revenue decreased 141 million or 2 percent as compared with 2009 the decrease is primarily due to 130 million lower sales in intelligence systems and 57 million lower sales in civil systems partially offset by 55 million higher sales in defense systems the decrease in intelligence systems is primarily due to lower sales volume on restricted programs and the loss of the navstar global positioning system operational control segment gps ocx program the decrease in civil systems is primarily due to lower sales volume on the new york city wireless nycwin and armed forces health longitudinal technology application ahlta programs the increase in defense systems is primarily due to program growth on battlefield airborne communications node bacn joint national integration center research and development contract jrdc and integrated battle command system ibcs activities partially offset by lower sales volume on the tmss program as it nears completion and decreased systems and software engineer support activities 

segment operating income 

2011 – information systems operating income increased 10 million or 1 percent as compared with 2010 the increase is primarily driven by improved performance on several civil systems programs including the virginia it outsource vita contract and the effect of the sale of the county of san diego contract partially offset by the lower sales volume primarily at defense systems described above 

2010 – information systems operating income increased 132 million or 21 percent as compared with 2009 and as a percentage of sales increased 170 basis points the increase is primarily due to performance improvements on civil systems programs in 2009 operating income included 37 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the sale of asd 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

technical services 

 

 sales and service revenues 

2011 – technical services revenue decreased 531 million or 16 percent as compared with 2010 the decrease is primarily due to 626 million lower sales in defense and government services division dgsd and 87 million lower sales in training solutions division tsd partially offset by higher sales of 182 million in integrated logistics and modernization division ilmd the lower sales in dgsd are primarily due to the reduced participation in the nstec joint venture effective january 1 2011 the company reduced its participation in this joint venture resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture for 2011 compared with sales of 579 million in 2010 the lower sales in tsd are primarily due to lower volume on the joint warfighting center and africa contingency operations training  assistance programs and lower volume on completion of the global linguists solutions program the higher sales in ilmd are primarily due to increased activity on the kc10 program which began in february 2010 

2010 – technical services revenue increased 454 million or 16 percent as compared with 2009 the increase is primarily due to 379 million higher sales in the ilmd the increase in ilmd is primarily due to the continued rampup of the recently awarded kc10 and c20 programs 

segment operating income 

2011 – operating income at technical services increased 10 million or 5 percent as compared with 2010 and as a percentage of sales increased 160 basis points the increase is primarily due to effects of the change in participation in the nstec joint venture and performance improvements on several ilmd and dgsd programs partially offset by unfavorable program performance on kc10 and lower sales volume on certain tsd programs 

2010 – operating income at technical services increased 45 million or 28 percent as compared with 2009 the increase is primarily due to the higher sales volume discussed above operating income as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points and reflects improved program performance and business mix changes 

backlog 

definition 

total backlog at december 31 2011 was approximately 395 billion total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders except for authorized task orders which are included up to the authorized value for multiyear services contracts with nonfederal government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment for the year ended december 31 2011 and total backlog for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

 backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made approximately 59 percent of the 395 billion total backlog at december 31 2011 is expected to be converted into sales in 2012 total us government orders including those made on behalf of foreign governments comprised 87 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2011 total foreign customer orders accounted for 7 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2011 domestic commercial backlog represented 6 percent of total backlog at the end of 2011

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we changed our backlog measurement criteria to include a valuation adjustment for open unfulfilled contracts that in our judgment may not be converted to future sales but which have not been closed or deobligated by the customer under our prior criteria backlog represented remaining work effort to be incurred on signed contracts in process or open contract value generally related to either 1 work scope not fully utilized by the customer and 2 open contract value related to the closeout of overhead claim years based on this prior criteria backlog was reduced as revenue was recognized or as the customer took contract action to close contracts andor deobligate funds our recent experience indicates that our customers have not been timely in taking the aforementioned contract actions accordingly effective december 31 2011 we have modified our criteria to include the recognition of a valuation reserve to adjust our outstanding backlog to reflect our future contract revenue expectations the effects of this change in procedures reduced december 31 2011 backlog by 3 billion including a reduction in the backlog at information systems by 23 billion and technical services by 725 million 

2011 – total backlog was reduced by 17 billion at technical services to reflect a change in the company’s participation in the nstec joint venture effective january 1 2011 at which time the nstec joint venture results were no longer consolidated into the company’s consolidated financial statements total backlog was also reduced by an aggregate of 15 billion at aerospace systems to reflect restructuring and termination of certain space programs 

2010 – a 11 billion reduction in backlog was recorded in 2010 as a result of the restructure of the npoess program at our aerospace systems segment 

backlog was also impacted in 2010 by an agreement we reached with the commonwealth of virginia related to the vita contract the agreement defined minimum revenue amounts for the remaining years under the base contract and extended the contract for three additional years through 2019 we recorded a favorable backlog adjustment of 824 million for the definitization of the base contract revenues for years 2011 through 2016 while the contract extension and 2010 portion of the base contract revenues totaling 802 million were recorded as new awards in the period in our information systems segment

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements capital expenditures strategic business acquisitions and divestitures debt issuance and repayment required and voluntary pension contributions returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock in addition to our cash position we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including but not limited to cash provided by operations free cash flow and debttoebitda ratio we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

as of december 31 2011 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was 546 million at the present time we do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations 

the table below summarizes key components of operating cash flow for continuing operations 

 

  

 free cash flow 

free cash flow from continuing operations is a nongaap financial measure and is calculated as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transitionsetup these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract’s period of performance we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful measure for investors to consider this measure is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

free cash flow from continuing operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow from continuing operations 

 

 cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii item 8 

operating activities 

2011 – cash provided by continuing operations in 2011 increased 291 million as compared to 2010 primarily due to lower tax payments and changes in trade working capital partially offset by higher pension plan contributions in 2011 pension plan contributions totaled 11 billion of which 1 billion was voluntarily prefunded 

in 2012 we expect to contribute the required minimum funding level of approximately 65 million to our pension plans and approximately 120 million to our other postretirement benefit plans we expect our cash on hand and cash generated from operations for 2012 to be sufficient to service debt and contract obligations finance capital expenditures continue acquisition of shares under the share repurchase program and continue paying dividends to our shareholders although 2012 cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations we may borrow under credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash flows we have an aggregate commitment of 2 billion available under two revolving credit facilities that can be accessed on a sameday basis both facilities are currently undrawn and had no borrowings during the year ended december 31 2011 additionally we believe we could access capital markets for debt financing for longerterm funding under current market conditions if needed 

2010 – cash provided by continuing operations in 2010 increased 61 million as compared with 2009 primarily the result of lower tax payments pension plan contributions totaled 789 million in 2010 of which 728 million was voluntarily prefunded in 2009 cash provided by continuing operations included 508 million for taxes paid related to the sale of asd 

2009 – cash provided by continuing operations in 2009 decreased 710 million as compared with 2008 reflecting higher voluntary pension contributions and increased income taxes paid resulting from the sale of asd pension plan contributions totaled 657 million in 2009 of which 601 million was voluntarily prefunded 

investing activities 

2011 – net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations was 743 million in 2011 reflecting a 14 billion contribution received from the spinoff of shipbuilding business in 2011 partially offset by 488 million of capital expenditures and a 250 million investment in short term investments capital expenditure commitments at december 31 2011 of approximately 293 million are expected to be paid with cash on hand 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2010 – net cash used in investing activities by continuing operations was 571 million in 2010 and reflects 579 million of capital expenditures which includes 57 million of capitalized software costs 

2009 – cash provided by investing activities by continuing operations was 11 billion in 2009 during 2009 we received 165 billion in proceeds from the sale of asd see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 paid 68 million for outsourcing costs related to outsourcing services contracts and paid 33 million to acquire sonoma photonics inc and the assets from swift engineering’s killer bee unmanned air systems product line see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 capital expenditures in 2009 were 473 million which includes 36 million of capitalized software costs 

financing activities 

2011 – net cash used in financing activities by continuing operations in 2011 was 35 billion and reflects 23 billion in repurchases of common stock 768 million in debt payments and 543 in cash dividends paid 

2010 – net cash used in financing activities by continuing operations in 2010 was 11 billion and reflects 12 billion in repurchases of common stock 1 billion in debt payments including the redemption of 682 million of higher coupon debt and 229 million of fees and associated premiums paid to the tendering holders of these debt securities and 545 million in cash dividends paid these financing related cash outflows were partially offset by 15 billion in net proceeds from new debt issuances see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

2009 – net cash used in financing activities by continuing operations in 2009 was 12 billion and reflects 11 billion in repurchases of common stock 539 million in cash dividends paid and 474 million in debt payments these financing related cash outflows were partially offset by 843 million in net proceeds from new debt issuance in 2009 

share repurchases  – we repurchased 402 million 197 million and 231 million shares in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively see purchases of equity securities by issuer and affiliated purchasers in part ii item 5 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a discussion concerning our common stock repurchases 

credit facilities 

in september 2011 the company entered into two senior unsecured credit facilities the credit agreements in an aggregate principal amount of 2 billion the first credit agreement amended the company’s 2 billion fiveyear credit facility dated august 10 2007 by reducing the aggregate principal amount available under the facility by 500 million to 15 billion and extending the maturity date to september 2016 the second credit agreement is a new 364day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million 

the credit agreements contain covenants substantially similar to those of the previous fiveyear credit facility which restrict the company’s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens the company also cannot permit the ratio of its consolidated debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreements to exceed 65 percent the company is in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements at december 31 2011 there was no balance outstanding under either of these credit facilities 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital  – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 

we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from continuing operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and in the capital markets if needed will be sufficient in 2012 to service debt and contract obligations finance capital expenditures pay federal foreign and state income taxes fund required and voluntary pension and other post retirement benefit plan contributions continue acquisition of 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

shares under the share repurchase program and continue paying dividends to shareholders we will continue to assess potential ramifications of the us government’s spending reduction initiatives as previously discussed these reductions could have a significant impact on our business and our overall financial results 

financial arrangements – in the ordinary course of business the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations at december 31 2011 there were 195 million of standby letters of credit 186 million of bank guarantees and 139 million of surety bonds outstanding 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 and the estimated timing of future cash payments 

 

  

  

 the table above also excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by erisa in relation to the company’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling approximately 35 billion over the next five years 185 million in 2012 421 million in 2013 12 billion in 2014 1 billion in 2015 and 702 million in 2016 the company also has payments due under plans that are not required to be funded in advance but are funded on a payasyougo basis see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8

foreign currency risk – we are exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to our foreign operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies at december 31 2011 foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 233 million were outstanding 

inflation risk – we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts bids for longerterm firm fixedprice contracts typically include labor and other cost escalations in amounts that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance 

a 10 percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations

patents 

 

the following table summarizes the number of patents we own or have pending as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

patents developed while under contract with the us government may be subject to use by the us government we license intellectual property to and from third parties we believe our ability to conduct operations would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular intellectual property right see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

seasonality 

 

no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal our revenue recognition timing is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments – revenue recognition in part ii item 7 

 

backlog 

 

at december 31 2010 total backlog was 642 billion compared with 692 billion at the end of 2009 approximately 47 percent of backlog at december 31 2010 is expected to be converted into sales in 2011 

 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders for multiyear services contracts with nonfederal government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in part ii item 7 

 

raw materials 

 

the most significant raw material we require is steel used primarily for shipbuilding we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with a number of steel suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to steel purchases through certain contractual arrangements with the us government while we have generally been able to obtain key raw materials required in our production processes in a timely manner a significant delay in supply deliveries could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see risk factors in part i item 1a and overview – outlook in part ii item 7 

 

government regulation 

 

our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance if any of our us government contracts were to be terminated for convenience we would generally be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in the rare circumstance where a us government contract does not have such termination protection we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts see risk factors in part i item 1a

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information in this form 10k reflect the operating results of restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs ird expenses are included in general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts ird expenses totaled 603 million 610 million and 564 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we charge expenses for research and development sponsored by the customer directly to the related contracts 

 

employee relations 

 

we believe that we maintain good relations with our 117100 employees of which approximately 20 percent are covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements we negotiated or renegotiated twelve of our collective bargaining agreements in 2010 these negotiations had no material adverse effect on our results of operations for risks associated with collective bargaining agreements see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

environmental matters 

 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we provide for the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where we determine it is probable that we will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by other environmental agencies these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements by estimating the possible remediation costs that we could reasonably incur on a sitebysite basis these estimates consider our environmental engineers’ professional judgment and when necessary we consult with outside environmental specialists in most instances we can only estimate a range of reasonably possible costs we accrue our best estimate when determinable or the minimum amount when no single amount is more probable we record accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable our environmental remediation accruals do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters nor do they include any amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations 

 

we estimate that at december 31 2010 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation sites is 280 million to 674 million of which we accrued 109 million in other current liabilities and 207 million in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position we record environmental accruals on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties we provide environmental accruals based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities we may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we have made the investments we believe necessary to comply with environmental laws 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 to comply with existing green initiatives and our greenhouse gas emissions goal we expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

competitive conditions 

 

we compete with many companies in the us defense industry and the information and services markets for a number of programs both large and small in the us defense industry lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company general dynamics corporation l3 communications corporation saic and bae systems inc are our primary competitors intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of our business and the defense industry it is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not frequently found in other industries 

 

our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services affordably and efficiently like most of our competitors we are vertically integrated but also have a high reliance on the supply chain we must continue to maintain dependable sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this increasingly complex manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is vital to our success 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which are generally more labor intensive with highly competitive margin rates and contract performance periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with specialized expertise our ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors the most important factor is the ability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly we have implemented various workforce initiatives to ensure our success in attracting developing and retaining these skilled professionals in sufficient numbers to maintain or improve our competitive position within these markets 

 

in both the us defense industry and information and services markets the federal government has recently indicated that it intends to increase industry competition for its future procurement of products and services this may lead to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on cost competitiveness and affordability than in the past in addition the dod has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities and enhance dod best practices including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors see overview in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a these new initiatives when implemented could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole and a reduced opportunity set would in turn intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report 

 

  

the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for many programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years consequently programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations the entire federal government is currently funded under a continuing resolution until march 4 2011 the impact severity and duration of the current us economic situation the sweeping economic plans adopted by the us government and pressures on the federal budget could also adversely affect the total funding andor funding for individual programs in the event that appropriations for any of our programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such program and on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed in the rare circumstance where a us government contract does not have such termination protection we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means to the extent such means are unavailable or do not fully address the costs incurred or profit on those costs we could face significant losses from the termination for convenience of a contract that lacks termination protection termination by the us government of a contract for convenience could also result in the cancellation of future work on that program termination by the us government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for reprocurement costs in excess of the original contract price net of the value of work accepted from the original contract termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts 

 

  

us government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements these regulations and requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs if any such regulations or procurement requirements change our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our margins 

 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

 

the us government from time to time recommends to its contractors that certain contract prices be reduced or that costs allocated to certain contracts be disallowed these recommendations can involve substantial amounts in the past as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries we have on occasion made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts 

 

we are also from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act if we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting given our dependence on 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

in september 2010 the dod announced various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors these initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy these new initiatives are expected to have a significant impact on the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers and they could have a significant impact on current programs as well as new dod business opportunities in his january 6 2011 announcement regarding future plans the secretary of defense employed some of these initiatives to reduce costs and free up resources for reinvestment for example he discussed using multiyear procurement of navy aircraft information technology infrastructure streamlining reductions in outsourcing consolidation of operating centers and staffs improving depot and supply chain processes downsizing intelligence organizations and eliminating some elements of the dod’s bureaucracy changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and if so how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so these initiatives are still fairly new and the full impact to our business remains uncertain and subject to the manner in which the dod implements them 

 

  

we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas we anticipate higher competition in some of our core markets as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies and fewer new program starts in addition as discussed in more detail above projected us defense spending levels for periods beyond the nearterm are uncertain and difficult to predict changes in us defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities we are also facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod may turn to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

the competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in the award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even where a bid protest does not result in a rebid the resolution typically extends the time until the contract activity can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced 

 

  

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 

operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees or could experience difficulty in performing under our contracts if the needs for such employees are unmet 

 

approximately 20 percent of our 117100 employees are covered by an aggregate of 32 collective bargaining agreements we expect to renegotiate renewals of four of our collective bargaining agreements in 2011 collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements if we experience such difficulties we could incur additional expenses and work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

  

we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected we have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties or delays or workforcerelated issues or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timelines and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and quality of their products the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in cost estimates on one or 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

more programs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

most of our contracts are firm fixedprice contracts or flexibly priced contracts our risk varies with the type of contract flexibly priced contracts include both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts due to their nature firm fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts approximately 33 percent of our annual revenues are derived from firm fixedprice contracts – see contracts in part ii item 7 we typically enter into firm fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in our contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our firm fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of firm fixedprice development contracts that include production units is subject to our ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 

 

under a fixedprice incentive contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability contracts in shipbuilding are often fixedprice incentive contracts for production of a first item without a separate development contract accordingly we face the additional difficulty of estimating production costs on a product that has not yet been designed further shipbuilding sometimes enters into followon fixedprice contracts after a significant delay from the first production request and the passage of time makes it more difficult for us to accurately estimate costs for renewed production 

 

under a costtype contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee that represents profit we enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

 

  

when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we face unanticipated contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected 

 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

our costs may increase over the term of our contracts through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these provisions a significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us government there are currently several components for which there may be only one supplier the inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to damaging storms and other natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes and environmental disasters such as oil spills although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract which could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

 

natural disasters can also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of our performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of our selfimposed efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7

although our international business constitutes only 5 percent of total revenues we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on us changes in regulation or political environment may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

 

the services and products we provide internationally including through the use of subcontractors are sometimes in countries with unstable governments in areas of military conflict or at military installations this increases the risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees subcontractors or other third parties we maintain insurance to mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations but our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover these claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs arising from those claims see additional discussion of possible inadequacy of our insurance coverage below in addition any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity for the company which may adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or result in the loss of existing and future contracts the impact of these factors is difficult to predict but any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

we have implemented extensive compliance controls policies and procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials security clearance breaches cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business our results of operations and our reputation 

 

  

as a defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations loss of security within this critical operational infrastructure could disrupt our operations require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our performance 

 

we also manage information technology systems for various customers while we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing these systems we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own systems computer viruses attempts to gain access to our customers’ data or other electronic security breaches could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems for our customers unauthorized release of confidential or personally identifiable information and corruption of customer data 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions we must take potential liability to customers and litigation expenses 

 

  

the development and operation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers nuclearpowered submarines nuclear facilities and other nuclear operations subject us to various risks including 

 

  

the us government provides indemnity protection against specified risks under our contracts pursuant to public law 85804 and the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act for certain of our nuclear operations risks our nuclear operations are subject to various safetyrelated requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirements promulgated by these agencies could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures additionally while we maintain insurance for certain risks related to transportation of low level nuclear materials and waste such as contaminated clothing and for regulatory changes in the health safety and fire protection areas there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions commonly referred to as “green initiatives” compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs 

 

environmental laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration the listing would continue until the epa concludes that the cause of the violation had been cured listed facilities cannot be used in performing any us government contract while they are listed by the epa 

 

the adoption of new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

the size type and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are and may become subject to various environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see legal proceedings in part i item 3 critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 any claims and litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

 

  

we own many us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property the us government has rights to use certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other security measures these agreements and security measures may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

 

in some instances we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

 

  

we endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including for example natural disasters and product liability not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example a catastrophic earthquake claim in some but not all circumstances we may receive indemnification from the us government because of the limitations in overall available coverage referred to above we may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an adverse effect upon our financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we commenced legal action against an insurance carrier arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina and another carrier has denied coverage for certain other losses related to 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

hurricane katrina and advised us that it will seek reimbursement of certain amounts previously advanced by that carrier see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business these investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates goodwill accounts for approximately half of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill amounts for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangible assets we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time merge with or acquire businesses or form joint ventures or create strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets and partner performance although we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful 

 

  

in july 2010 we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the shipbuilding segment including but not limited to a spinoff to our shareholders in preparation for an anticipated spinoff of the shipbuilding business to our shareholders a registration statement on form 10 for the shares of our wholly owned subsidiary huntington ingalls industries inc the entity that would hold the shipbuilding business was initially filed with the securities and exchange commission in october 2010 with amendments filed in november 2010 december 2010 and january 2011 we cannot assure you that the exploration of these strategic alternatives will result in any transaction our ability to complete a transaction involving the shipbuilding segment in a timely manner or even at all could be subject to several factors including changes in the company’s operating performance our ability to obtain any necessary consents or approvals changes in governmental regulations and policies and changes in business political and economic conditions in the united states as a condition of an anticipated spinoff we have obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service and expect to receive an opinion of counsel that the spinoff will be taxfree to the company and our shareholders but can give no assurance that any anticipated spinoff will ultimately qualify as a taxfree transaction if a transaction involving the shipbuilding segment is delayed for any reason we may not realize the anticipated benefits and if a transaction does not occur we will not realize such benefits each of these risks could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

 

  

the financial and credit markets recently experienced high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers historically we have occasionally accessed these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions capital expansion projects refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit in the future we may not be able to obtain capital market financing or bank financing when needed on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

a tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay 

 

we have executed transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of counterparty default 

 

  

a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

 

variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for example the recent volatility in the financial markets resulted in lower than expected returns on our pension plan assets in 2008 which resulted in higher pension costs in subsequent years see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

additionally due to government regulations pension plan cost recoveries under our government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are accrued for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made timing differences between pension costs accrued for financial statement purposes or when pension funding occurs compared to when such costs are recoverable as allowable costs under our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations in may 2010 the us cost accounting standards board published a proposed rulemaking that if adopted could provide a framework to partially harmonize these funding timing differences see overview – industry factors recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules in part ii item 7 for further discussion 

 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of income from contracts for financial statement purposes and for income tax regulations can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

significant impact on cash flow in a particular period furthermore changes in applicable domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow

overview 

 

business 

we provide technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions in aerospace electronics information and services and shipbuilding to our global customers we participate in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states us and abroad as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier we conduct most of our business with the us government principally the department of defense dod we also conduct business with local state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers 

 

notable events

significant financial events for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

  

  

other notable events for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

  

  

outlook 

beginning with the credit crisis of 2008 through the present the united states and global economies have experienced a period of substantial economic uncertainty and turmoil and the related financial markets have been characterized by significant volatility while the financial markets have begun to stabilize and improve in 2009 and 2010 the us and global economies continue to struggle as a result of high levels of national debt and historic levels of borrowing to support stimulus and financial support spending 

 

current levels of deficit spending are at high levels and likely are unsustainable for the us and several of its allies and we expect that us and allied government defense spending may come under increasing pressure as governments search for ways to reduce deficits and national debts defense secretary gates recently proposed a baseline fiscal 2012 defense budget of 553 billion which is 6 billion higher than the fiscal 2011 budget request but 13 billion less than previously planned under this budget proposal the overall defense budget will decline by 78 billion over a five year period beginning in fiscal 2012 from the previous plan and will include program cancellations and restructurings including reducing the number of f35 joint strike fighters from 449 to 325 jets 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

over that period northrop grumman is one of the largest subcontractors on the f35 program and if approved by congress the reduction would impact our revenues 

 

secretary gates also outlined future opportunities for which we could compete including a next generation nuclear capable longrange bomber additional fa18 ef aircraft to offset the reduction in the f35 aircraft as well as numerous opportunities to apply our unmanned airborne technologies and capabilities and our broad sensor technologies to new products and to upgrade several existing platforms 

 

while the real rate of growth in the top line defense budget may be slowing for the first time since 911 the us government’s budgetary process continues to give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that it is addressing we believe that our current contracts and our strong backlog of previously awarded contracts align well with our customer’s future needs and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows from our businesses nonetheless we recognize that no business is immune to the current economic situation and new policy initiatives could adversely affect future defense spending levels which could lower our expected future revenues certain programs in which we participate may be subject to potential reductions due to this slower rate of growth in the us defense budget and the utilization of funds to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 

 

liquidity trends  – in light of the ongoing economic situation we have evaluated our future liquidity needs both from a shortterm and longterm perspective we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines will be sufficient in 2011 to service debt finance capital expansion projects pay federal foreign and state income taxes fund pension and other postretirement benefit plans and continue paying dividends to shareholders we have a committed 2 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august 10 2012 that can be accessed on a sameday basis 

 

we believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for longterm liquidity if necessary from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussions about our financing activities 

 

industry factors 

we are subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony whereby demand for our products and services comes primarily from one customer and by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix 

 

recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules  – on may 10 2010 the cas board published a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa funding requirements the nprm would “harmonize” by mitigating the mismatch between cas costs and ppaamended employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding requirements until the final rule is published and to the extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans will continue to experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and pension expenses recoverable under cas the final rule is expected to be issued in 2011 and to apply to contracts starting the year following the award of the first cas covered contract after the effective date of the new rule this would mean the rule would apply to our contracts in 2012 we anticipate that contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional cas contract costs resulting from the final rule 

 

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the united states continues to face a complex and rapidly changing national security environment while simultaneously addressing domestic economic challenges such as unemployment federal budget deficits and the growing national debt the us government’s investment in capabilities that respond to constantly evolving threats is increasingly being balanced against the need to address domestic economic challenges we believe that 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the us government will continue to place a high priority on defense spending and national security as well as economic challenges and will continue to invest in sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management precision strike and strategic agility 

 

the us government faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness while also pursuing modernization and reducing overhead and inefficiency the dod has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities and enhance dod business practices including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors 

 

the dod initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy initial plans resulting from these initiatives were announced in early 2010 and the defense department expects that these initiatives will generate 100 billion in savings on january 6 2011 secretary gates provided initial details on fiscal year 2012 defense budget and programmatic plans and elaborated on the allocation of the 100 billion in expected savings from efficiency initiatives the secretary described plans to allocate 28 billion for increased operating costs and 70 billion for investment in high priority capabilities in addition to the efficiency savings the dod plans to reduce defense spending from its prior plans by 78 billion over the next five fiscal years 

 

at the date of this report the fiscal year 2012 defense budget has not been submitted by the president and congress had not yet passed a baseline fiscal year 2011 defense budget or any of the appropriations funding bills relating to our customer base as a result the us government is currently operating under a continuing resolution cr that funds programs and services at fiscal year 2010 levels the cr is set to expire on march 4 2011 after which congress will either pass a new appropriations bill or extend a cr the latter case would likely fund programs at fiscal year 2010 levels and would affect the profitability of some of our programs and potentially delay new awards we anticipate continued spirited debate over defense spending in 2011 as part of a larger dialog around the federal deficit and potential cuts in government spending budget decisions made in this environment could have longterm consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 

 

although reductions to certain programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete are always possible we believe that spending on recapitalization modernization and maintenance of defense and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms given the current era of irregular warfare we expect an increase in investment in persistent awareness with intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems cyber warfare and expansion of information available for the warfighter to make timely decisions other significant new competitive opportunities include long range strike directed energy applications missile defense satellite communications systems restricted programs cybersecurity technical services and information technology contracts and numerous international and homeland security programs 

 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement and other regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act noncompliance found by any one agency could result in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving contracts with all us government agencies we could experience material adverse effects on our business operations if we or a portion of our business were suspended or debarred 

 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” we recently established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a fiveyear period through december 31 2014 to comply with existing green initiatives and our greenhouse gas emissions goal we expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position results of operations or cash flows

2009  – we sold our advisory services division asd in december 2009 for 165 billion in cash to an investor group led by general atlantic llc and affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp and recognized a gain of 15 million net of taxes asd was a business unit comprised of the assets and liabilities of tasc inc its whollyowned subsidiary tasc services corporation and certain contracts carved out from other businesses also in information systems that provide systems engineering technical assistance seta and other analysis and advisory services sales for asd in the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 were approximately 15 billion and 16 billion respectively the assets liabilities and operating results of this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

 

2008 – we sold our electrooptical systems eos business in april 2008 for 175 million in cash to l3 communications corporation and recognized a gain of 19 million net of taxes eos formerly a part of the electronic systems segment produces night vision and applied optics products sales for this business through april 2008 were approximately 53 million the assets liabilities and operating results of this business are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

 

discontinued operations  – earnings for the businesses classified within discontinued operations primarily as a result of the sale of asd discussed above were as follows 

 

 

 

contracts 

 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm government contracts for development production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

flexibly priced contracts  – includes both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

 

firm fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor timeandmaterials contracts are considered firm fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

 

the following table summarizes 2010 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

 

 

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

 

award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract award fee contracts are used in certain of our operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the broad area maritime surveillance bams unmanned aircraft system and the majority of satellite contracts 

 

compliance and monitoring  – we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

 

revenue recognition 

overview  – we derive the majority of our business from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contract we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant gaap revenue recognition principles 

 

we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the shipbuilding segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 

 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

certain service contracts  – we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in technical services and information systems we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

 

contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap guidance for revenue arrangements with multipleelements accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

 

we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the measurement period are recognized in net earnings 

 

acquisition accruals  – we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment we recorded these accruals in accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience 

 

tests for impairment  – we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30th of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred in order to test for potential impairment we use a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

 

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longerterm contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 

 

as a result of our announcement to wind down operations at shipbuilding’s avondale louisiana facility see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 we performed an interim impairment test on shipbuilding’s goodwill as of june 30 2010 and concluded that the estimated fair value of the shipbuilding reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 

 

the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2010 indicated that the estimated fair value of all reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview  – we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter known to us including any settlement offers and determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

 

us government claims  – from time to time our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs when such findings are presented we engage us government representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed where appropriate provisions are made to reflect our expected exposure to the matters raised by the us government representatives and such provisions are reviewed on a quarterly basis for sufficiency based on the most recent information available 

 

environmental accruals  – we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

 

factors which could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology 

 

litigation accruals  – litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known to us 

 

uncertain tax positions – tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in our tax return we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 under existing gaap prior to january 1 2009 changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill effective january 1 2009 such changes will be recorded to income tax expense adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

 

retirement benefits 

overview  – we annually evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

actuaries in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

 

assumptions  – the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 

 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 576 percent at december 31 2010 and 603 percent at december 31 2009 holding all other assumptions constant and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the 10 percent accounting corridor in 2010 an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2010 would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2010 by approximately 80 million of which 3 million relates to postretirement benefits and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december 31 2010 by approximately 850 million of which 70 million relates to postretirement benefits the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required due to adverse capital market conditions in 2008 our pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008 as a result substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial losses outside the 10 percent accounting corridor at the end of 2008 thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense as a result of this condition sensitivity of net periodic pension costs to changes in the discount rate were much higher in 2009 and 2010 than was the case in 2008 and prior this condition is expected to continue into the near future 

 

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2010 and 2009 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return assumption for 2010 holding all other assumptions constant would increase or decrease our pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2010 by approximately 54 million of which 2 million relates to postretirement benefits 

 

health care cost trend rates  – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants using a combination of market expectations and economic projections including the effect of health care reform we selected an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 8 percent for 2011 and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2017 in 2009 we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 7 percent for 2010 and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2014 although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2010 postretirement benefit results

consolidated operating results 

 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

 

 

 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

 

 

 

2010 – sales and service revenues increased 1 billion or 3 percent over 2009 the increase is due to 862 million higher product sales and 140 million higher service revenues the 4 percent increase in product sales reflects sales growth in aerospace systems and shipbuilding the 1 percent increase in service revenues reflects sales growth at technical services 

 

2009 – sales and service revenues increased 14 billion or 4 percent over 2008 the increase is due to 13 billion higher product sales and 160 million higher service revenues the 7 percent increase in product sales reflects sales growth in aerospace systems electronic systems and shipbuilding the 1 percent increase in service revenues reflects sales growth in information systems and technical services 

 

see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of sales and service revenues and general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

cost of product sales and service revenues 

2010 – cost of product sales in 2010 increased 229 million or 1 percent over 2009 primarily due to the higher sales volume described above the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due to lower gaap pension expenses and performance improvements in aerospace systems and electronic systems 

 

cost of service revenues in 2010 increased 250 million or 2 percent over 2009 and as a percentage of service revenues increased 90 basis points primarily due to program mix changes at information systems 

 

2009 – cost of product sales in 2009 increased 11 billion or 7 percent over 2008 primarily due to the higher sales volume described above the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due to higher gaap pension costs across all of our businesses 

 

cost of service revenues in 2009 increased 654 million or 6 percent over 2008 primarily due to the higher sales volume described above the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to higher gaap pension costs across all of our businesses 

 

see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

general and administrative expenses  – in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts for most components of the company these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations general and administrative expenses for 2010 decreased 64 million from the prior year primarily due to the 2009 disposition of asd at our information systems segment general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from 93 percent in 2009 to 89 percent in 2010 primarily due to cost reductions realized from the 2009 streamlining of our organizational structure from seven to five operating segments general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from 97 percent in 2008 to 93 percent in 2009 primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs and a 64 million gain from a legal settlement in 2009 net of legal provisions and related expenses 

 

goodwill impairment  – in 2008 we recorded a noncash charge totaling 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding as a result of adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in market multiples and our stock price 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

operating income loss 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses we also further evaluate operating income for each of the business segments in which we operate 

 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating income” segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment neither of which affect the operating results of segments and the reversal of royalty income which is classified as “other net” for financial reporting purposes segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

 

the table below reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 

 

 

 

segment operating income loss 

segment operating income in 2010 increased 397 million or 14 percent as compared with 2009 total segment operating income was 96 percent and 87 percent of total sales and service revenues in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in 2010 segment operating income is primarily due to the 3 percent increase in sales volume and performance improvements across all operating segments segment operating income in 2009 was 29 billion as compared with segment operating loss of 299 million in 2008 the loss in 2008 was primarily due to goodwill impairment charges totaling 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding see discussion of segment operating results below for further information 

 

unallocated corporate expenses 

unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules and therefore not allocated to the segments such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses unallocated corporate expenses for 2010 increased 109 million or 98 percent as compared with 2009 primarily due to inclusion of a 64 million net gain from a legal settlement in 2009 as well as an increase in environmental health and welfare and stock compensation expenses in 2010 unallocated corporate expenses for 2009 decreased 46 million or 29 percent as compared with 2008 primarily due to a 64 million gain from a legal settlement in 2009 net of legal provisions and related expenses partially offset by higher costs related to environmental remediation and postretirement employee benefits 

 

net pension adjustment 

net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expenses determined in accordance with gaap and pension expense allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance with cas the pension adjustment in 2010 decreased by 286 million as compared with 2009 primarily due to lower gaap pension expense as a result of favorable returns on pension plan assets in 2009 the net pension adjustment in 2009 was an expense of 311 million as compared with income of 263 million in 2008 the net pension expense in 2009 was primarily the result of negative returns on plan assets in 2008 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

royalty income adjustment 

royalty income is included in segment operating income and reclassified to other income for financial reporting purposes see other net below 

 

interest expense 

2010  – interest expense in 2010 was comparable to 2009 

 

2009  – interest expense in 2009 decreased 14 million or 5 percent as compared with 2008 the decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest and lower interest rates 

 

charge on debt redemption 

2010  – in november 2010 we repurchased outstanding debt held by our subsidiaries northrop grumman systems corporation and northrop grumman shipbuilding inc and recorded a pretax charge of 231 million primarily related to premiums paid on the debt tendered see liquidity and capital resources below and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

other net 

2010  – other net for 2010 decreased 27 million as compared with 2009 primarily due to lower royalty income and lower returns on investments in marketable securities used as a funding source for nonqualified employee benefits 

 

2009  – other net for 2009 increased 26 million as compared with 2008 primarily due to positive marktomarket adjustments on investments in marketable securities used as funding for nonqualified employee benefits and a gain from the recovery of a loan to an affiliate which more than offset the benefit in the prior year of 60 million of royalty income from patent infringement settlements 

 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2010  – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2010 was 215 percent compared with 306 percent in 2009 in 2010 we recognized net tax benefits of approximately 296 million to reflect the final approval from the irs and the us congressional joint committee on taxation joint committee of the irs’ examination of our tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 in 2009 we recognized net tax benefits of approximately 75 million primarily as a result of a final settlement with the irs office of appeals and the joint committee related to our tax returns for years ended 2001 through 2003 

 

2009  – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2009 was 306 percent compared with 338 percent in 2008 excluding the noncash nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding the 2009 tax rate reflects net tax benefits of approximately 75 million related to a final settlement with the irs as discussed above 

 

discontinued operations 

2010  – earnings from discontinued operations net of tax was 15 million and is primarily attributable to adjustments to the gain on the 2009 sale of asd to reflect purchase price adjustments and the utilization of additional capital loss carryforwards 

 

2009  – earnings from discontinued operations net of tax was 113 million for 2009 compared with 117 million in 2008 the earnings were primarily attributable to the operating results and gain on disposition of asd which was sold in december 2009 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

diluted earnings loss per share 

2010  – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 were 677 per share as compared with 487 diluted earnings per share in 2009 diluted earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3011 million for 2010 and 3233 million for 2009 respectively 

 

2009  – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were 487 per share as compared with 412 diluted loss per share in 2008 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

of 3233 million for 2009 and weighted average basic shares outstanding of 3345 million for 2008 for the year ended december 31 2008 the potential dilutive effect of 71 million shares from stock options stock awards and the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as the shares would have had an antidilutive effect the goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding reduced our 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 915 per share 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2010  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was 25 billion as compared with 21 billion in 2009 and reflects improved cash collections from our customers and lower tax payments primarily due to 508 million taxes paid in 2009 related to the sale of asd in 2010 we contributed 894 million to our pension plans of which 830 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 858 million in 2009 of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded income taxes paid net of refunds was 11 billion in 2010 as compared with 13 billion in 2009 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 included 94 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 11 million of interest income received 

 

2009  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was 21 billion compared with 32 billion in 2008 and reflects higher pension plan contributions and income tax payments in 2009 we contributed 858 million to our pension plans of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 320 million in 2008 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded income taxes paid net of refunds was 13 billion in 2009 as compared with 719 million in 2008 income taxes paid in 2009 included 508 million resulting from the sale of asd 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 included 171 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 11 million of interest income 

 

segment operating results 

 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into five reportable segments aerospace systems electronic systems information systems shipbuilding and technical services see note 8 in part ii item 8 for more information about our segments 

 

in january 2010 we transferred our internal information technology services unit from the information systems segment to our corporate shared services group the intersegment sales and operating income for this unit that were previously recognized in the information systems segment are immaterial and have been eliminated for the years presented

key segment financial measures 

 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described on page 32 as indicated in our discussion on “contracts” on page 31 our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance due to far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative costs as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues and operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap unusual fluctuations in operating performance attributable to changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts however are described in our analysis based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations generally focuses around our five segments versus distinguishing between products and services our aerospace systems electronic systems and shipbuilding segments generate predominantly product sales while the information systems and technical services segments generate predominantly service revenues 

 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far and therefore not allocated to the segments changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 

 

operating income may also be affected by among other things the effects of workforce stoppages natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made approximately 48 percent of the 642 billion total backlog at december 31 2010 is expected to be converted into sales in 2011 total us government orders including those made on behalf of foreign governments comprised 91 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2010 total foreign customer orders accounted for 5 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2010 domestic commercial backlog represented 4 percent of total backlog at the end of 2010 

 

backlog adjustments 

2010  – a 11 billion reduction in backlog was recorded in 2010 as a result of the restructure of the npoess program at our aerospace systems segment 

 

backlog was also impacted in 2010 by an agreement we reached with the commonwealth of virginia related to the vita contract the agreement defined minimum revenue amounts for the remaining years under the base contract and extended the contract for three additional years through 2019 we recorded a favorable backlog adjustment of 824 million for the definitization of the base contract revenues for years 2011 through 2016 while the contract extension and 2010 portion of the base contract revenues totaling 802 million were recorded as new awards in the period in our information systems segment 

 

2009  – total backlog in 2009 reflects a negative backlog adjustment of 58 billion for the kinetic energy interceptor program termination for convenience at aerospace systems and the ddg 1000 program restructure at shipbuilding

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements capital expenditures strategic business acquisitions and divestitures debt issuance and repayment required and voluntary pension contributions and returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 

 

we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decisionmaking including net cash provided by operations free cash flow net debttoequity and net debttocapital we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 

 

 

 

  

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transitionsetup these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to consider this measure is a key factor used by management in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 

 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 

 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows located in part ii item 8 

 

operating activities 

2010  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased 320 million as compared with 2009 and reflects improved cash collections from our customers and lower tax payments in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities included 508 million taxes paid related to the sale of asd pension plan contributions totaled 894 million in 2010 of which 830 million was voluntarily prefunded 

 

in 2011 we expect to contribute the required minimum funding level of approximately 62 million to our pension plans and approximately 160 million to our other postretirement benefit plans and also expect to make additional voluntary pension contributions of approximately 500 million we expect cash generated from operations for 2011 to be sufficient to service debt and contract obligations finance capital expenditures continue acquisition of shares under the share repurchase program and continue paying dividends to our shareholders although 2011 cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations we may borrow under credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash flows we have a committed 2 billion revolving credit facility that is currently undrawn and that can be accessed on a sameday basis additionally we believe we could access capital markets for debt financing for longerterm funding under current market conditions if needed 

 

2009  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased 11 billion as compared with 2008 reflecting higher voluntary pension contributions and increased income taxes paid resulting from the sale of asd pension plan contributions totaled 858 million in 2009 of which 800 million was voluntary prefunded 

 

2008  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased 321 million as compared with 2007 and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade working capital reductions pension plan contributions totaled 320 million in 2008 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded and were comparable to 2007 net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 included 113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 23 million of interest income

financing activities 

2010  – cash used in financing activities in 2010 was 13 billion which was comparable to 2009 financing activities in 2010 reflect 12 billion in debt payments including the repurchase of 682 million of higher coupon debt 231 million for fees and associated premiums paid to the tendering holders of these debt securities and the repurchase of 178 million of shipbuilding indebtedness in connection with our analysis of strategic alternatives for that business these financing outflows were offset by 15 billion in net proceeds from new debt issuances see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 in addition we repurchased 12 billion of our common shares outstanding in 2010 

 

2009  – cash used in financing activities in 2009 was 12 billion compared with 2 billion in 2008 and reflects 843 million in net proceeds from new debt issuance in 2009 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

2008  – cash used in financing activities in 2008 was 2 billion compared to 15 billion in 2007 the 532 million increase is primarily due to 380 million more for share repurchases and 171 million lower proceeds from stock option exercises 

 

share repurchases  – we repurchased 197 million 231 million and 214 million shares in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see purchases of equity securities by issuer and affiliated purchasers in part ii item 5 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a discussion concerning our common stock repurchases 

 

credit facility 

we have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 2 billion and a maturity date of august 10 2012 the credit facility permits us to request additional lending commitments from the lenders under the agreement or other eligible lenders under certain circumstances and thereby increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending commitments under the agreement by up to an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains a financial covenant relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain restrictions on additional asset liens unless permitted by the agreement as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants 

 

there were no borrowings during 2010 and 2009 under this facility there was no balance outstanding under this facility at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital  – we believe we can obtain additional capital if necessary for longterm liquidity from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 

 

we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and in the capital markets if needed will be sufficient in 2011 to service debt and contract obligations finance capital expenditures pay federal foreign and state income taxes fund required 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

and voluntary pension and other post retirement benefit plan contributions continue acquisition of shares under the share repurchase program and continue paying dividends to shareholders we will continue to provide the productive capacity to perform our existing contracts prepare for future contracts and conduct research and development in the pursuit of developing opportunities 

 

financial arrangements  – in the ordinary course of business we use standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on certain contracts and to support our selfinsured workers’ compensation plans at december 31 2010 there were 303 million of unused standby letters of credit 192 million of bank guarantees and 446 million of surety bonds outstanding

history and organization 

 

history 

northrop grumman corporation herein referred to as “northrop grumman” the “company” “we” “us” or “our” is an integrated enterprise consisting of businesses that cover the entire global security spectrum from undersea to outer space and into cyberspace the companies that are part of today’s northrop grumman have achieved historic accomplishments from transporting charles lindbergh across the atlantic to carrying astronauts to the moon’s surface and back 

 

the company was originally formed as northrop corporation in california in 1939 and was reincorporated in delaware in 1985 from 1994 through 2002 we entered a period of significant expansion through acquisitions of other businesses most notably 

 

  

since 2002 other notable acquisitions include integic corporation 2005 an information technology provider specializing in enterprise health and business process management solutions and essex corporation 2007 a signal processing product and services provider to us intelligence and defense customers in addition we divested our advisory services division tasc inc in 2009 

 

these and other transactions have shaped us into our present position as a premier provider of technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in aerospace electronics information and services and shipbuilding as prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier we participate in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the us and abroad we conduct most of our business with the us government principally the department of defense dod we also conduct business with local state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers for a discussion of risks associated with our dod and foreign operations see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

organization 

from time to time we acquire or dispose of businesses and realign contracts programs or business areas among and within our operating segments that possess similar customers expertise and capabilities internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services the operating results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect these changes made through december 31 2009 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

in january 2009 we streamlined our organizational structure by reducing the number of operating segments from seven to five the five segments are aerospace systems which combines the former integrated systems and space technology segments electronic systems information systems which combines the former information technology and mission systems segments shipbuilding and technical services creation of the aerospace systems and information systems segments was intended to strengthen our alignment with customers improve our ability to execute on programs and win new business and enhance cost competitiveness 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we realigned certain logistics services and technical support programs and transferred assets from the information systems and electronic systems segments to the technical services segment this realignment was intended to strengthen our core capability in aircraft and electronics maintenance repair and overhaul life cycle optimization and training and simulation services 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we transferred certain optics and laser programs from the information systems segment to the aerospace systems segment the prior year sales and segment operating income were not reclassified to reflect this business transfer as the operating results of this business were not considered material 

 

in december 2009 we sold our advisory services division asd for 165 billion in cash to an investor group led by general atlantic llc and affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp and recognized a gain of 15 million net of taxes asd was a business unit comprised of the assets and liabilities of tasc inc its whollyowned subsidiary tasc services corporation and certain contracts carved out from other businesses also in our information systems segment that provide systems engineering technical assistance seta and other analysis and advisory services 

 

in january 2008 we realigned the newport news and ship systems businesses into a single operating segment called northrop grumman shipbuilding previously these businesses were separate operating segments which were aggregated into a single reporting segment for financial reporting purposes in addition we transferred certain electronic systems businesses to the former mission systems segment during the first quarter of 2008 

 

during the second quarter of 2008 we transferred certain programs and assets from the missiles business in the information systems segment to the aerospace systems segment this transfer allowed information systems to focus on the rapidly growing command control communications computing intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr business the missiles business became an integrated element of our aerospace business growth strategy

environmental matters 

 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we provide for the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where we determine it is probable that we will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by other environmental agencies these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements by estimating the possible remediation costs that we could reasonably incur on a sitebysite basis these estimates consider our environmental engineers’ professional judgment and when necessary we consult with outside environmental specialists in most instances we can only estimate a range of reasonably possible costs we accrue our best estimate when determinable or the minimum amount when no single amount is more probable we record accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

 

we estimate that at december 31 2009 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation sites is 239 million to 483 million of which we accrued 115 million in other current liabilities and 168 million in other long term liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position we record environmental accruals on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties we provide environmental accruals based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities we may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we have made the investments we believe necessary to comply with environmental laws although we cannot predict whether information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” we recently established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions during the next five years to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and to meet this goal we expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

competitive conditions 

 

we compete with many companies in the us defense industry for a number of programs both large and small but primarily with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company general dynamics corporation l3 communications corporation saic and bae systems intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of our business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency we must continue to maintain sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which are generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas our ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly we have implemented various workforce initiatives to ensure our success in attracting developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve our competitive position within these markets

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance we urge you to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report 

 

  

approximately 92 percent of our revenues during 2009 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government which includes foreign military sales we are a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies these contracts are subject to the respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work and delays in the timing of contract approval as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements 

 

in addition a material amount of our revenues and profits are derived from programs that are subject to security classification restrictions restricted business which could limit our ability to discuss details about these programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result you might have less insight into our restricted business than our other businesses or could experience less ability to evaluate fully the risks disputes or claims associated with the restricted business 

 

  

the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years consequently programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the 2010 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations the impact severity and duration of the current us economic situation the sweeping economic plans adopted by the us government and pressures on the federal budget could also adversely affect the total funding andor funding for individual programs in the event that appropriations for one of our programs becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such program 

 

we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of warrelated activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or bid prospects 

 

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs termination resulting from our default can expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts 

 

  

us government contractors must comply with significant procurement regulations and other requirements these requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs if procurement requirements change our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our margins 

 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review include our purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

 

we are also from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations and are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act and the foreign corrupt practices act we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition if we are found to have violated the law or are indicted or convicted for violations of federal laws related to government security regulations employment practices or protection of the environment or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting for some period of time given our dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

  

we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas we anticipate higher competition in some of our core markets as a result of the reduction in budgets for many us government agencies and fewer new program starts in addition as discussed in more detail above projected us defense spending levels for periods beyond the nearterm are uncertain and difficult to predict changes in us defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities we are also facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod are more frequently turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the competitive environment is also affected by an increase in bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in the award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even where a bid protest does not result in a rebid the resolution extends the time until the contract activity can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced 

 

  

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 

operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills andor security clearances if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees or could experience difficulty in performing under our contracts if the needs for such employees are unmet 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

approximately 20 percent of our 120700 employees are covered by an aggregate of 32 collective bargaining agreements we expect to renegotiate renewals of three of our collective bargaining agreements in 2010 and we are continuing to negotiate an initial contract for a group of employees collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements if we experience such difficulties we could incur additional expenses and work stoppages any such expenses or delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the recent past we have experienced work stoppages and other labor disruptions in shipbuilding 

 

  

we design develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms we could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected we have not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if we were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

  

operating income is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties or delays or workforcerelated issues or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timelines and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and quality of their products the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

most of our contracts are firm fixedprice contracts or flexibly priced contracts flexibly priced contracts include both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts due to their nature firm fixedprice contracts 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts approximately 33 percent of our annual revenues are derived from firm fixedprice contracts – see contracts in part ii item 7 we typically enter into firm fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in our contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of our firm fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of firm fixedprice development contracts that include production units is subject to our ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of our significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system program for the wedgetail and peace eagle contracts both of which are performed by the electronic systems segment 

 

under a fixedprice incentive contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability contracts in shipbuilding are often fixedprice incentive contracts for production of a first item without a separate development contract accordingly we face the additional difficulty of estimating production costs on a product that has not yet been designed further shipbuilding sometimes enters into followon fixedprice contracts after a significant delay from the first production request and the passage of time makes it more difficult for us to accurately estimate costs for renewed production 

 

under a costtype contract the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee that represents profit we enter into costtype contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges these costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issues arise 

 

  

when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we face unanticipated contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected 

 

we also rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to damaging storms and other natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract which could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

 

natural disasters can also disrupt electrical and other power distribution networks and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance including computer and internet operation and accessibility 

 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of our selfimposed efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

although our international business constitutes only 5 percent of total revenues we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on us changes in regulation or political environment may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

 

  

we have implemented extensive compliance controls policies and procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business our results of operations and our reputation 

 

  

as a defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations loss of security within this critical operational infrastructure could disrupt our operations require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our performance 

 

we also manage information technology systems for various customers while we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing these systems we face generally the same security threats for these systems as for our own systems computer viruses attempts to gain access to our customers’ data or other electronic security breaches could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems for our customers unauthorized release of confidential or personally identifiable information and corruption of customer data these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions we must take potential liability to customers and litigation expenses 

 

  

the development and operation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers nuclearpowered submarines and other nuclear operations subject us to various risks including 

 

  

the us government provides indemnity protection against specified risks under public law 85804 and the priceanderson nuclear indemnities act for certain of our nuclear operations risks our nuclear operations are subject to various safetyrelated requirements imposed by the us navy department of energy and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirements promulgated by these agencies could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns and other actions commonly referred to as “green initiatives” compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant capital and operating costs but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

environmental laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases in addition if we were found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration the listing would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation had been cured listed facilities cannot be used in performing any us government contract while they are listed by the epa we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment 

 

the adoption of new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

  

the size and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various existing environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see legal proceedings in part i item 3 critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

 

  

we own many us and foreign patents and patent applications and we have rights in numerous trademarks and copyrights the us government has licenses under certain of our patents and certain other intellectual property that are developed in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use such patents and intellectual property for government purposes our patents and other intellectual property are subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

 

we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not subject to patent protection we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors or other parties as well as through other security measures these agreements and security measures may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information in the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

 

in some instances we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others in the future we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

 

  

we endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example a catastrophic earthquake claim in some but not all circumstances we may receive indemnification from the us government because of the limitations in overall available coverage referred to above we may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations and our overall consolidated financial position additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for example we commenced legal action against an insurance carrier arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina and another carrier has denied coverage for certain other losses related to hurricane katrina and advised us that it will seek reimbursement of certain amounts previously advanced by that carrier see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

as part of our overall strategy we will from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business these investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates goodwill accounts for approximately half of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill amounts for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangible assets we continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time merge with or acquire businesses or form joint ventures or create strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets and partner performance although we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful 

 

  

the financial and credit markets recently experienced levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers historically we have occasionally accessed these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions capital expansion projects refinancing existing debt and 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

issuing letters of credit in the future we may not be able to obtain capital market financing or credit availability on similar terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

the tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations and could adversely affect our results of operations the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental cost and delay 

 

we have executed transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us cannot be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it 

 

  

a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 

 

variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the recent volatility in the financial markets resulted in lower than expected returns on our pension plan assets in 2008 which resulted in higher pension costs in 2009 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain furthermore changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability

overview 

 

business 

we provide technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions in aerospace electronics information and services and shipbuilding to our global customers we participate in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states us and abroad as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier we conduct most of our business with the us government principally the department of defense dod we also conduct business with local state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers

notable events for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

outlook 

from the end of 2008 through 2009 the united states and global economies endured a period of substantial economic uncertainty and the related financial markets experienced significant volatility while the financial markets showed signs of stabilization in the second half of 2009 the us and global economies are still recovering and some companies continue to struggle if the future economic environment continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years we could be negatively impacted if the financial viability of certain of our subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired in addition the valuation of our pension assets was negatively affected by the volatility in the financial markets in 2008 resulting in higher pension costs in 2009 should the financial markets experience further decline which impacts our plan asset returns we could again have higher future pension costs and required plan funding than in prior years 

 

we conduct business primarily with us government customers under longterm contracts and we have not materially changed our product and service offerings due to the current economic conditions the us government’s budgetary processes give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that it is addressing we believe that our current contracts and our strong backlog of previously awarded contracts align well with our customer’s future needs and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows from our businesses nonetheless we recognize that no business is completely immune to the current economic

situation and new policy initiatives could adversely affect future defense spending levels which could lower our expected future revenues certain programs in which we participate may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget and funds being utilized to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 

 

we believe that our portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in 2010 and beyond despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget we expect sales in 2010 to be in the range of 34 to 346 billion based on backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 692 billion as of december 31 2009 we describe in the following paragraphs the major industry and economic factors that may affect our future performance 

 

industry factors 

we are subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony whereby demand for our products and services comes primarily from one customer and by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix 

 

liquidity trends  – in light of the ongoing economic situation we have evaluated our future liquidity needs both from a shortterm and longterm perspective we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines will be sufficient in 2010 to service debt finance capital expansion projects pay federal foreign and state income taxes fund pension and other postretirement benefit plans and continue paying dividends to shareholders we have a committed 2 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august 10 2012 that can be accessed on a sameday basis 

 

during the second quarter of 2009 we issued 350 million of 5year and 500 million of 10year unsecured senior obligations interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears at fixed rates of 370 percent and 505 percent per annum and the notes will mature on august 1 2014 and august 1 2019 respectively we can redeem these senior notes at our discretion at any time prior to maturity we are using the net proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes including debt repayment acquisitions share repurchases pension plan funding and working capital a portion of the net proceeds was used to retire 400 million of 8 percent senior debt that matured 

 

we believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for longterm liquidity if necessary from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 

 

recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules  – on september 2 2008 the cas board published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa requirements the proposed cas rule includes provisions for a transition period from the existing cas requirement to a partially harmonized cas requirement as published the proposed rule would partially mitigate the nearterm mismatch between ppaamended employee retirement income security act erisa minimum contribution requirements which would not yet be recoverable under cas however until the final rule is published and to the extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate any mismatch between erisa funding requirements and cas government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans in general would still experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and the cas recoverable pension costs the cas board is expected to issue a final rule in 2010 which would apply to our contracts starting in 2011 we anticipate that contractors will be entitled to seek an equitable adjustment for the additional cas contract costs required by the final rule 

 

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

today the united states faces a complex and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent upon early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion deterrence 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

active defense security and stability operations or peacekeeping we believe that the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives as a result the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to include the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating stealth longrange survivability persistence and standoff capabilities advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms will also be a priority 

 

the united states is engaged in a multifront multidecade struggle that we expect will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the recently released 2010 quadrennial defense review emphasizes the related challenge of rebuilding readiness at a time when dod is pursuing growth modernization and transformation of its forces and capabilities we do not expect defense requirements to change significantly in the foreseeable future and the size of national security budgets is expected to remain responsive the fiscal year 2011 budget submitted by the president requests 5489 billion in discretionary authority for the dod base budget and an additional 159 billion to support contingency operations representing a slight increase over the 2010 budget although the president’s budget request proposes reductions to certain programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete we believe that spending on recapitalization and modernization of defense and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority 

 

our substantial new competitive opportunities include unmanned vehicles reconnaissance and surveillance platforms missile defense radar satellite communications systems restricted programs cybersecurity technical services and information technology contracts and numerous international and homeland security programs in pursuit of these opportunities we continue to focus on operational and financial performance for continued improvements in earnings in 2010 and beyond 

 

us government programs focused on areas involving intelligence persistent surveillance directed energy applications and cyber space in which we either participate or strive to participate must compete with other programs for consideration and resources during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes in addition to domestic and international considerations the pentagon faces its own nearterm and longterm internal fiscal constraints as it attempts to balance competing pressures from within and adhere to calls for better economy efficiency and accountability budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for our size and structure and the entire defense industry 

 

we have historically concentrated our efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne and space surveillance battle management systems integration defense electronics cybersecurity and information technology we have a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr and missile systems we believe that our programs are a high priority for national defense but under budgetary pressures one or more of our programs may be reduced extended or terminated by our us government customers 

 

congress last year passed legislation to add further discipline and accountability to the acquisition system this legislation the weapon system acquisition reform act of 2009 requires dod to develop mechanisms to address cost schedule and performance in establishing program requirements as acquisition reform progresses we will continue to anticipate and respond to the actions of the pentagon and congress to determine their impact on our operations 

 

we provide certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of our product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act noncompliance found by any one agency may result in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies we could experience material adverse effects on our business and results of operations if we were suspended or debarred from additional contracts 

 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” we recently established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions during the next five years to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and to meet this goal we expect to incur capital and operating costs but at this time we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position results of operations or cash flows

discontinued operations  – earnings for the businesses classified within discontinued operations primarily as a result of the sale of asd discussed above were as follows 

 

 

 

contracts 

 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm government contracts for development production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

flexibly priced contracts  – includes both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

firm fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor timeandmaterials contracts are considered firm fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

 

the following table summarizes 2009 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

 

 

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

 

award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract award fee contracts are widely used throughout our operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the global hawk engineering and manufacturing development and the majority of satellite contracts 

 

compliance and monitoring  – we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

 

revenue recognition 

overview  – we derive the majority of our business from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant revenue recognition gaap 

 

we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost or the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the shipbuilding segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 

 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

certain service contracts  – we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in information systems and technical services we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

 

contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap for revenue arrangements with multipleelements accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

 

we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  – we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates for acquisitions completed through december 31 2008 we recorded adjustments to fair value assessments to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months and adjusted goodwill for the resolution of income tax uncertainties which extended beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

in 2009 we implemented new gaap accounting guidance related to business combinations that impacts how we record adjustments to fair values included in the purchase price allocation and the resolution of income tax uncertainties for acquisitions completed after january 1 2009 any adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and subsequent resolution of uncertain tax positions are recognized in net earnings rather than as adjustments to goodwill 

 

acquisition accruals  – we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment we recorded these accruals in accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience 

 

tests for impairment  – we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30th of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred in order to test for potential impairment we use a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

 

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 

 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview  – we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers and determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

 

environmental accruals  – we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

factors which could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

litigation accruals  – litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

uncertain tax positions – in 2007 we adopted a new accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions and made a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions at the date of adoption only tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in our tax return we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 under existing gaap prior to january 1 2009 changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill effective january 1 2009 such changes will be recorded to income tax expense adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

 

retirement benefits 

overview  – we annually evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside actuaries in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

 

assumptions  – the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 

 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield of highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 603 percent at december 31 2009 and 625 percent at december 31 2008 holding all other assumptions constant and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the 10 percent accounting corridor in 2009 an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2009 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2009 by approximately 80 million of which 4 million relates to postretirement benefits and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december 31 2009 by approximately 800 million of which 70 million relates to postretirement benefits the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required due to adverse capital market conditions in 2008 our pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008 as a result substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial losses outside the 10 percent accounting corridor at the end of 2008 thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense as a result of this condition sensitivity of net periodic costs to changes in the discount rate were much higher in 2009 than was the case in 2008 and prior this condition is expected to continue into the near future 

 

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2009 and 2008 we assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return assumption for 2009 holding all other assumptions constant would increase or decrease our pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2009 by approximately 48 million 

 

health care cost trend rates  – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants for 2009 we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 7 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2014 in 2008 we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 75 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent be reached in 2014 

 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2009 postretirement benefit results

2009 – cost of product sales in 2009 increased 11 billion or 7 percent over 2008 primarily as a result of the higher sales volume described above the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due to higher gaap pension costs across all of our businesses 

 

cost of service revenues in 2009 increased 654 million or 6 percent over 2008 primarily as a result of the higher sales volume described above the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to higher us gaap pension costs across all of our businesses 

 

2008 – cost of product sales in 2008 increased 12 billion or 8 percent over 2007 and increased 170 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the same period due largely to the sales volume increase described above the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales is primarily due to cost growth at the gulf coast shipyards in 2008 we recorded a net charge of 263 million on lhd8 and other shipbuilding programs as well as additional costs for work delays at a subcontractor on the lpd program as a result of hurricane ike 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

cost of service revenues in 2008 increased 871 million or 9 percent over 2007 primarily due to the sales volume increase described above the 70 basis points increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to lower performance in the civil systems business area in information systems 

 

see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

general and administrative expenses  – in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts for most components of the company these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from 97 percent in 2008 to 93 percent in 2009 primarily as a result of lower corporate overhead costs and a gain resulting from a legal settlement general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from 101 percent in 2007 to 97 percent in 2008 primarily as a result of costs remaining relatively constant while revenues increased over the same period in 2007 

 

goodwill impairment – in 2008 we recorded a noncash charge totaling 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

operating income loss 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses we also further evaluate operating income for each of the business segments in which we operate 

 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating income” segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment neither of which affect the segments and the reversal of royalty income which is classified as “other net” for financial reporting purposes segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

 

 

 

segment operating income loss 

2009 – segment operating income in 2009 was 29 billion as compared with segment operating loss of 299 million in 2008 and segment operating income of 30 billion in 2007 the loss in 2008 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge totaling 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding 

 

unallocated expenses 

unallocated expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and far and therefore not allocated to the segments for costs related to management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses unallocated expenses for 2009 decreased 46 million or 29 percent as compared with 2008 primarily due to a gain resulting from a legal settlement net of legal provisions and related expenses partially offset by higher costs related to environmental remediation and postretirement employee benefits unallocated expenses 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

for 2008 decreased 52 million or 25 percent as compared with 2007 primarily due to 88 million in higher legal and investigative provisions recorded in 2007 partially offset by an increase in environmental health and welfare and other unallocated corporate costs in 2008 

 

net pension adjustment – net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense determined in accordance with gaap and pension expense allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance with cas the net pension adjustment in 2009 was an expense of 311 million as compared with income of 263 million and 127 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the net pension expense in 2009 was primarily the result of negative returns on plan assets in 2008 the income in 2008 and 2007 was due to decreased gaap pension expense primarily resulting from betterthanestimated investment returns in prior years and higher discount rate assumptions 

 

royalty income adjustment  – royalty income is included in segment operating income and reclassified to other income for financial reporting purposes see other net below 

 

interest expense 

2009  – interest expense in 2009 decreased 14 million or 5 percent as compared with 2008 the decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest and lower interest rates 

 

2008  – interest expense in 2008 decreased 41 million or 12 percent as compared with 2007 the decrease is primarily due to the conversion and redemption of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in april 2008 which reduced the related dividends paid during 2008 which were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 lower libor rates on the interest rate swap agreements also contributed to the decrease in interest expense 

 

other net 

2009 – other net for 2009 was 64 million income an increase of 26 million as compared with 2008 primarily due to positive marktomarket adjustments on investments in marketable securities used as funding for nonqualified employee benefits and a gain from the recovery of a loan to an affiliate partially offset by 60 million of royalty income from patent infringement settlements in 2008 

 

2008 – other net for 2008 was 38 million income an increase of 21 million as compared with 2007 primarily due to 60 million in royalty income from patent infringement settlements at electronic systems in 2008 partially offset by negative marktomarket adjustments on investments in marketable securities used as a funding source for nonqualified employee benefits 

 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2009 – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2009 was 306 percent compared with 338 percent in 2008 excluding the noncash nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding in 2009 we recognized net tax benefits of approximately 75 million primarily as a result of a final settlement with the irs office of appeals and the us congressional joint committee on taxation joint committee related to our tax returns for the years ended 20012003 

 

2008 – our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2008 was 338 percent excluding the noncash nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding as compared with 328 percent in 2007 in 2008 we recognized net tax benefits of 35 million primarily attributable to a settlement reached with the irs and the joint committee with respect to the irs audit of trw tax returns for the years 19992002 

 

discontinued operations 

2009 – earnings from discontinued operations net of tax was 113 million for 2009 compared with 117 million in 2008 the earnings were primarily attributable to the operating results and gain on disposition of the asd which was sold in december 2009 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

diluted earnings loss per share 

2009 – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were 487 per share as compared with 412 diluted loss per share in 2008 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3233 million for 2009 and weighted average basic shares outstanding of 3345 million for 2008 for the year ended december 31 2008 the potential dilutive effect of 71 million shares from stock options stock awards and the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as the shares would have had an antidilutive effect the goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at aerospace systems and shipbuilding reduced our 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 915 per share 

 

2008 – diluted loss per share from continuing operations in 2008 was 412 per share as compared with 501 diluted earnings per share in 2007 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage basic shares outstanding of 3345 million for 2008 which excludes potential dilutive shares as noted above and weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3543 million for 2007 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2009 – net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was 21 billion compared with 32 billion in 2008 and reflects higher pension plan contributions and income tax payments in 2009 we contributed 858 million to our pension plans of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared with 320 million in 2008 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded income taxes paid net of refunds was 13 billion in 2009 as compared with 719 million in 2008 income taxes paid in 2009 included 508 million resulting from the sale of asd 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 included 171 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 11 million of interest income 

 

2008 – net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was 32 billion as compared to 29 billion in 2007 and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade working capital reductions pension plan contributions totaled 320 million in 2008 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded and were comparable to 2007 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 included 113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 23 million of interest income 

 

segment operating results 

 

basis of presentation 

realignments – in january 2009 we streamlined our organizational structure by reducing the number of operating segments from seven to five the five segments are aerospace systems which combines the former integrated systems and space technology segments electronic systems information systems which combines the former information technology and mission systems segments shipbuilding and technical services creation of the aerospace systems and information systems segments is intended to strengthen alignment with customers improve our ability to execute on programs and win new business and enhance our cost competitiveness 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we realigned certain logistics services and technical support programs and transferred assets from the information systems and electronic systems segments to the technical services segment this realignment is intended to strengthen our core capability in aircraft and electronics maintenance repair and overhaul life cycle optimization and training and simulation services 

 

the sales and segment operating income in the following tables have been revised to reflect the above realignments for all periods presented 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we transferred certain optics and laser programs from the information systems segment to the aerospace systems segment we did not reclassify the prior year sales and segment operating income in the following tables to reflect this business transfer as the operating results of this business were not considered material 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

business dispositions – as previously mentioned we sold asd in december 2009 operating results of this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and thus are not included in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 

key segment financial measures 

 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described on page 31 based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results of operations generally focuses around our five segments versus distinguishing between products and services product sales are predominantly generated in the aerospace systems electronic systems and shipbuilding segments while the majority of our service revenues are generated by the information systems and technical services segments 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far and therefore not allocated to the segments changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded operating income may also be affected by among other things the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

segment operating income loss 

2009 – shipbuilding operating income was 299 million as compared with operating loss of 23 billion in 2008 the increase was primarily due to the 2008 goodwill impairment charge of 25 billion see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and improved performance in expeditionary warfare as compared to 2008 in 2008 the expeditionary warfare business had net negative performance adjustments of 263 million due principally to adjustments on the lhd 8 contract cost growth and schedule delays on the lpd program and the effects of hurricane ike on a subcontractor’s performance 

 

2008 – shipbuilding operating loss was 23 billion as compared with operating income of 538 million in the same period of 2007 the decrease was due to a goodwill impairment charge of 25 billion and 366 million in net lower performance results partially offset by the higher sales volume described above the decrease in performance results was primarily due to 263 million in net performance adjustments on lhd 8 and other programs in 2008 cost growth and schedule delays on several lpd ships resulting primarily from the effects of hurricane ike on an lpd subcontractor see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

and the effect of reductions in contract booking rates resulting from management taking a more conservative approach in its risk assessment on programs throughout the gulf coast shipyards 

 

technical services 

 

 

 

sales and service revenues 

2009 – technical services revenue increased 241 million or 10 percent as compared with 2008 the increase was primarily due to 245 million higher sales in the life cycle optimization  engineering group lcoe and 74 million higher sales in the training  simulation group tsg offset by 72 million in lower sales for the systems support group ssg the increase in lcoe was due to increased task orders for the counter narcoterrorism technology program office and higher demand on the hunter contractor logistics support cls programs in support of the dod’s surge in intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr initiatives the increase in tsg was due to higher volume on various training and simulation programs including the joint warfighting center support saudi arabian national guard modernization and training global linguists solutions national level exercise 2009 and african contingency operations training assistance programs these increases were partially offset by lower 2009 sales in ssg due to the completion of the joint base operations support jbosc program in 2008 

 

2008 – technical services revenue increased 113 million or 5 percent as compared with 2007 the increase was primarily due to 93 million in higher sales in lcoe and 42 million in higher sales in tsg partially offset by 26 million in lower sales in ssg the increase in lcoe was associated with higher volume in the hunter cls and b2 stealth bomber programs the increase in tsg was primarily due to higher sales volume from various new training and simulation program awards the decrease in ssg was primarily associated with the completion of the jbosc program 

 

segment operating income 

2009 – operating income at technical services increased 17 million or 12 percent as compared with 2008 the increase was primarily due to the higher sales volume discussed above and 3 million from performance improvements across numerous programs 

 

2008 – technical services operating income increased 5 million or 4 percent as compared with 2007 the increase in operating income was due to higher sales volume was partially offset by a higher level of planned internal investment and final allocation of current and prior year overhead items 

 

backlog 

total backlog at december 31 2009 was approximately 692 billion total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for multiyear services contracts with nonfederal government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made approximately 37 percent of the 692 billion total backlog at december 31 2009 is expected to be converted into sales in 2010 total us government orders including those made on behalf of foreign governments comprised 93 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2009 total foreign customer orders accounted for 5 percent of the total backlog at the end of 2009 domestic commercial backlog represented 2 percent of total backlog at the end of 2009 

 

backlog adjustments 

in 2009 the change in backlog includes a decrease of 58 billion for the kinetic energy interceptor program termination for convenience and the ddg 1000 program restructure 

 

additionally total backlog for both years have been adjusted by 16 billion for the divestiture of tasc inc

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements capital expenditures strategic business acquisitions and divestitures debt repayments required and voluntary pension contributions and returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operations free cash flow net debttoequity and net debttocapital we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 

 

 

 

  

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transitionsetup these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors as it reflects our ability to grow by funding strategic business acquisitions and return value to shareholders through repurchasing our shares and paying dividends 

 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 

 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows located in part ii item 8 

 

northrop grumman corporation

environmental matters 

 

federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations the company has provided for the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where the company has determined it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

 

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company on a sitebysite basis such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before it has determined that collection is probable 

 

management estimates that at december 31 2008 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation sites is 186 million to 279 million of which 231 million is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties the company provides environmental accruals based upon its expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities in addition should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued which could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the company has made the investments it believes necessary in order to comply with environmental laws although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

competitive conditions 

 

northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which are generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas the company’s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets see risk factors in part i item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within the company’s control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance the company urges investors to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report 

 

  

approximately 91 percent of the company’s revenues during 2008 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and are therefore affected by among other things the federal budget process the company is a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies these contracts are subject to the respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards and in the case of contracts with the us government the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes the us government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements the termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the us government could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or prospects current or future economic conditions could result in the reprioritization of or reduction in future us government defense spending levels 

 

in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred the company is involved as a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning a contract terminated for convenience see other matters in part i item 3 termination resulting from the company’s default could expose the company to liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to compete for contracts 

 

in addition a material amount of the company’s revenues and profits is derived from programs that are subject to security classification restrictions restricted business which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details about these programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors might have less insight into the company’s restricted business than other businesses of the company or could experience less ability to evaluate fully the risks disputes or claims associated with restricted business 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency a loss of business to the company’s competitors could have a material adverse affect on the company’s ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 

  

the company designs develops and manufactures technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by its customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent the company from achieving contractual requirements 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

in addition the company’s products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure problems with quality country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received by the company 

 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected the company has not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

  

operating income is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to customers are incurred this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins approximately 30 percent of the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixedprice contracts – see contracts in part ii item 7 flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees including cost sharing agreements and negative performance incentives the company typically enters into fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition certain contracts other than fixedprice contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in those contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of the company’s fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of fixedprice development contracts which include production units is subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of the company’s significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system program for the wedgetail and peace eagle contracts both of which are performed by the electronics segment it is also not unprecedented in the shipbuilding business for the company to 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

negotiate fixedprice production followon contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing flexibly priced development contracts 

 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of the company’s contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of company initiated efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

 

because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

the company has thousands of contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to us and foreign laws and regulations prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

in addition international business subjects the company to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on the company changes in regulation or political environment may affect the company’s ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

 

the company operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited by the us government and others on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with all applicable government regulations negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments from time to time the company is subject to us government investigations relating to its operations government contractors that are found to have violated the law such as the false claims act or the arms export control act or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law may be subject to significant fines such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government

contracting for some period of time given the company’s dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

  

the company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors as well as other factors that may cause operating results to be adversely affected changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract which could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to compete for future contracts if the recent period of adverse economic conditions and credit market volatility continues the company’s profitability may be negatively impacted by the inability of certain of the company’s subcontractors and key suppliers to continue providing their products andor services 

 

operating results are heavily dependent upon the company’s ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skill sets andor security clearances the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements and avoidance of organized work stoppages are also critical to the ongoing operations of the company 

 

the company has significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to damaging storms and other natural disasters while preventative measures typically help to minimize harm to the company the damage and disruption resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be significant although no assurances can be made the company believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters through insurance or its contracts 

 

natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt electrical and other power distribution networks and cause adverse effects on profitability and performance including computer and internet operation and accessibility computer viruses and similar harmful software programs as well as network outages disruptions and attacks also may have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability and performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented 

 

  

as part of its overall strategy the company will from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business these investments are made upon careful target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price after acquisition unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates goodwill accounts for approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets the company evaluates goodwill amounts for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in market multiples and the company’s stock price led to a

noncash aftertax charge of 31 billion for impairment of goodwill at shipbuilding and space technology if the current economic conditions continue to deteriorate causing further decline in the company’s stock price additional impairments to one or more businesses could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis the company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill and other longlived assets see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

the size and complexity of the company’s business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation the company is subject to environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established accruals could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see legal proceedings in part i item 3 and critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

a substantial portion of the company’s current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon the company’s various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs in addition funding requirements for benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows recent volatility in the financial markets has resulted in lower than expected returns on the company’s pension plan assets resulting in potentially higher pension costs in future periods 

 

  

the company endeavors to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption not every risk or liability can be protected against by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred in some but not all circumstances the company may receive indemnification from the us government because of the limitations in overall available coverage referred to above the company may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations and its overall consolidated financial position additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and where litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to the company may have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

the company like others in the defense industry is aware of a potential problem presented by strict compliance with the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically or from certain foreign countries subcontractors and lowertier suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply with the rule as written subject to limitations 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

inability to certify that all enumerated specialty metals in a product comply with sourcing requirements can lead to us government customers preventing delivery of materiel and products critical to national defense 

 

  

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption in late 2008 and early 2009 historically the company has occasionally accessed these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions capital expansion projects refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit in the future the company may not be able to obtain capital market financing or credit availability on similar terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

the united states and global economies are currently experiencing a period of substantial economic uncertainty with wideranging effects including the current disruption in global financial markets possible effects of these economic events are described in the preceding risk factors including those relating to us government defense spending business disruptions caused by suppliers or subcontractors impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets pension costs and access to capital and credit markets although governments worldwide including the us government have initiated sweeping economic plans the company is unable to predict the impact severity and duration of these economic events which could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

us government investigations and claims  – departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or an operating division or subdivision suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on government contracts 

 

as previously disclosed in october 2005 the us department of justice and a restricted us government customer apprised the company of potential substantial claims relating to certain microelectronic parts produced by the space and electronics sector of former trw inc now a part of the company in the third quarter of 2006 the company proposed to settle the claims and any associated matters and recognized a pretax charge of 1125 million to cover the cost of the settlement proposal and associated investigative costs the us government has advised the company that if continuing settlement discussions are not successful it will pursue its claims through litigation on november 26 2008 the us department of justice filed a notice of intervention in a false claims act case that remains under seal in the us district court for the central district of california because of the highly technical nature of the issues involved and their restricted status because of the significant disagreement of the company with the allegations of the underlying qui tam complaint and because of the significant disagreement between the company and the us government as to the us government’s theories of liability and damages including a material difference between the us government’s damage theories and the company’s offer final resolution of this matter could take a considerable amount of time particularly if litigation should ensue if the us government were to be ultimately successful on its theories of liability and damages which could be trebled under the federal false claims act the effect upon the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows would materially exceed the amount provided by the company based upon the information available to the company to date the company believes that it has substantive defenses but can give no assurance that its views will prevail accordingly the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be determined 

 

as previously disclosed in the second quarter of 2007 the us coast guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the deepwater program for eight converted 123foot patrol boats the vessels based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft alignment problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on the vessels the company submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper and in late december 2007 the coast guard advised integrated coast guard systems the contractors’ joint venture for performing the deepwater program that the coast guard is seeking 961 million from the joint venture as a 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

result of the revocation of acceptance of the eight vessels delivered under the 123foot conversion program the majority of the costs associated with the 123foot conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels which were converted under contracts with the company and a subcontractor to the company in may 2008 the coast guard advised the joint venture that the coast guard would support an investigation by the us department of justice of the joint venture and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its 961 million claim independently the department of justice had previously issued subpoenas related to the deepwater program pursuant to which the company has provided responsive documents the company recently learned that a civil false claims act complaint naming it as a defendant was filed under seal the relationship between the allegations in the complaint and the us department of justice’s investigation is unclear to the company based upon the information available to the company to date the company believes that it has substantive defenses to any potential claims but can give no assurance that its views will prevail 

 

in august 2008 the company disclosed to the antitrust division of the us department of justice possible violations of federal antitrust laws in connection with the bidding process for certain maintenance contracts at a military installation in california in february 2009 the company and the department of justice signed an agreement admitting the company into the corporate leniency program as a result of the company’s acceptance into the program the company will be exempt from federal criminal prosecution and criminal fines relating to the matters the company reported to the department of justice if the company complies with certain conditions including its continued cooperation with the government’s investigation and its agreement to make restitution if the government was harmed by the violations 

 

based upon the available information regarding matters that are subject to us government investigations other than as set out above the company believes but can give no assurance that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

litigation  – various claims and legal proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are pending against the company and its properties based upon the information available the company believes that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

as previously disclosed the us district court for the central district of california consolidated two separately filed employee retirement income security act erisa lawsuits which the plaintiffs seek to have certified as class actions into the in re northrop grumman corporation erisa litigation on august 7 2007 the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and the plaintiffs appealed the court’s decision on class certification to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on october 11 2007 the ninth circuit granted appellate review which delayed the commencement of trial previously scheduled to begin january 22 2008 the company believes that the outcome of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

other matters 

in the event of contract termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred under the contract as previously disclosed the company received a termination for convenience notice on the triservice standoff attack missile tssam program in 1995 in december 1996 the company filed a lawsuit against the us government in the us court of federal claims seeking the recovery of approximately 750 million for uncompensated performance costs investments and a reasonable profit on the program prior to 1996 the company had charged to operations in excess of 600 million related to this program the company is unable to predict whether it will realize some or all of its tssam claims none of which are recorded on its consolidated statement of financial position 

 

as previously disclosed the company is pursuing legal action against an insurance provider arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 the company commenced the action against factory mutual insurance company fm global on november 4 2005 which is now pending in the us district court for 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the central district of california western division in august 2007 the district court issued an order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage for the company’s katrinarelated loss in november 2007 fm global filed a notice of appeal of the district court’s order on august 14 2008 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the earlier summary judgment order in favor of the company holding that the fm global excess policy unambiguously excludes damage from the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina under its “flood” exclusion the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the california efficient proximate cause doctrine affords the company coverage under the policy even if the flood exclusion of the policy is unambiguous the company filed a petition for rehearing en banc or in the alternative for panel rehearing with the court of appeals on august 27 2008 on january 6 2009 the court of appeals ordered fm global to respond to the petition for rehearing by january 30 2009 fm global filed its opposition to the petition for rehearing and the company now awaits the court of appeal’s decision based on the current status of the assessment and claim process no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this matter

financial highlights 

  

notable events 

  

outlook 

the united states and global economies are currently undergoing a period of substantial economic uncertainty and the related financial markets are experiencing unprecedented volatility if the future economic environment continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years the company could experience difficulties if the financial viability of certain of its subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired in addition the volatility in the financial markets has affected the valuation of the company’s pension assets resulting in higher pension costs in future periods adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in market multiples and the company’s stock price have led to a noncash aftertax charge of 31 billion for impairment of goodwill at shipbuilding and space technology if the financial markets continue to deteriorate causing further decline in the company’s stock price and market capitalization further impairments of goodwill and other longlived assets may become necessary 

 

the company’s business is conducted primarily with us government customers under longterm contracts and there have been no material changes to the company’s product and service offerings due to the current economic conditions the us government’s budgetary processes give the company good visibility regarding future 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

spending and the threat areas that they are addressing management believes that the company’s current contracts and its strong backlog of previously awarded contracts are well aligned with the direction of its customer’s future needs and this provides the company with good insight regarding future cash flows from its businesses nonetheless management recognizes that no business is completely immune to the current economic situation and these economic conditions and the transition to a new presidential administration could adversely affect future defense spending levels which could lead to lower than expected revenues for the company in future years certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget forecasts and funds being utilized to support the ongoing global war on terrorism 

 

despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in 2009 and beyond based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 78 billion as of december 31 2008 the company expects sales in 2009 of approximately 345 billion the major industry and economic factors that may affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

 

industry factors 

northrop grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which is generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas the company’s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets 

 

liquidity trends  – in light of the current economic situation the company has also evaluated its future liquidity needs both from a shortterm and longterm basis the company believes that cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in 2009 to service debt finance capital expansion projects pay federal foreign and state income taxes fund pension and other postretirement benefit plans and continue paying dividends to shareholders the company has a committed 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

2 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august 10 2012 that can be accessed on a sameday basis 

 

to provide for longterm liquidity the company believes it can obtain additional capital if necessary from such sources as the public or private capital markets the sale of assets sale and leaseback of operating assets and leasing rather than purchasing new assets the company has an effective shelf registration on file with the sec 

 

recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules  – on september 2 2008 the cas board published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa requirements the proposed cas rule includes provisions for a transition period from the existing cas requirement to a partially harmonized cas requirement after the ppa effective date for “eligible government contractors” including northrop grumman which were granted a delay in their ppa effective date the proposed rule would partially mitigate the nearterm mismatch between ppaamended erisa minimum contribution requirements which would not yet be recoverable under cas however unless the final rule is revised government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans in general would still experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and the cas recoverable pension costs it is anticipated that contractors will be entitled to seek an equitable adjustment to prices of previously negotiated contracts subject to cas for increased contract costs which result from mandatory changes required by the final rule the cas board is required to issue its final rule no later than january 1 2010 

 

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts or threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification national responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations or peacekeeping the company believes that the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives as a result the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth longrange survivability persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access additionally advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms will also be required 

 

while the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow the company does not expect defense requirements to change significantly in the foreseeable future many allied countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with us forces the size of future us and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment while the political environment currently does not allow for a thorough insight into the fiscal 2010 budget it is expected defense spending will continue to grow in the near term though probably more modestly than in the past it is possible the new administration’s proposed budget will include reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete however the company believes that spending on recapitalization and modernization of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence persistent surveillance cyber space energysaving technologies and nonconventional warfare capabilities 

 

us government programs in which the company either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes budget 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of the company and the entire defense industry 

 

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include the nextgeneration longrange bomber space radar unmanned vehicles satellite communications systems restricted programs technical services and information technology contracts and numerous international and homeland security programs in pursuit of these opportunities northrop grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2010 and beyond 

 

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne and space surveillance battle management systems integration defense electronics and information technology the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology c4isr and missile systems the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense nevertheless under budgetary pressures there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated by the company’s us government customers 

 

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 

 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

contracts 

 

the majority of the company’s business is generated from longterm government contracts for development production and service activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations and advertising costs 

 

the company’s longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

flexibly priced contracts  – includes both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

 

firm fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor timeandmaterials contracts are considered firm fixedprice contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 

 

the following table summarizes 2008 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

 

 

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

 

positive award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company’s operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei f35 sdd global hawk engineering and manufacturing development emd lpd ddg1000 programs and the majority of satellite contracts 

 

compliance and monitoring  – on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

 

revenue recognition 

overview  – the majority of the company’s business is derived from longterm contracts for the construction of facilities production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 45 – accounting for longterm constructiontype contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 811 – accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  and the aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts the company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers the company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – the company generally recognizes revenues from its longterm contracts under the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the shipbuilding segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 

 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of its products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment sales under costtype contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 

 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

certain service contracts  – revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in the information and services business revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

 

service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 0021 – revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  – the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates for acquisitions completed through december 31 2008 adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months adjustments related to income tax uncertainties which may have extended beyond the purchase price allocation period through december 31 2008 were also recorded to goodwill 

 

acquisition accruals  – the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience 

 

goodwill  – the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30th of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when it is determined that impairment has occurred a charge to operations is recorded in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in current market multiples and the company’s stock price as of november 30 2008 have led to a goodwill impairment charge totaling 31 billion at shipbuilding and space technology the company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company’s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 

 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview  – the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel in accordance with statement of financial accounting 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

standards sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

 

environmental accruals  – the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated factors which could result in changes to the company’s assessment of probability range of loss and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operation or cash flows 

 

litigation accruals  – litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available the company believes that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

uncertain tax positions – effective january 1 2007 the company measures and records uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 48 – accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return only tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax return of the company the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 prior to 2007 the company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority under existing us gaap prior to january 1 2009 changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill effective january 1 2009 such changes will be recorded to income tax expense adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

 

retirement benefits 

overview  – assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

assumptions  – the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 

 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above the company’s weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 625 percent at december 31 2008 and 622 percent at december 31 2007 holding all other assumptions constant and since net actuarial gains and losses stayed within the 10 percent accounting corridor as was the case for the 2008 expense measurement period an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2008 would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2008 by approximately 30 million and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december 31 2008 by approximately 750 million the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required due to adverse capital market conditions the company’s pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008 as a result substantially all of the company’s plans have experienced net actuarial losses outside the 10 percent accounting corridor at the end of 2008 thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense as a result of this condition sensitivity of net periodic costs to changes in the discount rate will be much higher in the near future than was the case in 2008 

 

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2008 and 2007 the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return assumption for 2008 holding all other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the company’s pension and postretirement benefit expense for 2008 by approximately 60 million 

 

health care cost trend rates  – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants for 2008 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 75 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2014 in 2007 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 8 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2012 

 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2008 postretirement benefit results

consolidated operating results 

 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

 

 

 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

 

 

 

2008 – revenues for principal product businesses in integrated systems space technology electronics and shipbuilding during 2008 grew at a combined rate of approximately 6 percent over 2007 reflecting sales growth at all four reporting segments revenue for principal services businesses in information  services during 2008 grew approximately 8 percent over 2007 due largely to double digit growth at mission systems resulting from increased volume on contracts newly awarded in 2007 and 2008 and increased activity on other contracts 

 

2007  – revenues for principal product businesses in aerospace electronics and shipbuilding during 2007 grew at a combined rate of approximately 3 percent over 2006 reflecting sales growth in electronics and shipbuilding partially offset by reduced sales in aerospace the sales growth at electronics and shipbuilding is due to volume improvements across most business areas while the sales reduction in aerospace was anticipated as a number of contracts transitioned from development to production in 2007 revenue for principal services businesses in information  services during 2007 grew approximately 11 percent over 2006 due largely to double digit growth at information technology and technical services resulting from increased volume on contracts that were newly awarded in 2006 and increased activity on other contracts 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

cost of sales and service revenues 

 

cost of sales and general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

cost of product sales and service revenues 

2008 – cost of product sales during 2008 increased 12 billion or 8 percent over 2007 and increased 170 basis points as a percent of product sales over the same period due largely to the sales volume increase described above the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales is primarily due to cost growth at the gulf coast shipyards in the first quarter of 2008 the company recorded a 326 million pretax charge on lhd8 and other shipbuilding programs and in the third quarter of 2008 the company recorded additional costs for work delays at a subcontractor on the lpd program as a result of hurricane ike the lhd8 program achieved several important risk retirement milestones toward its planned delivery date and as a result 63 million of the first quarter 2008 charge was reversed in the second half of 2008 

 

cost of service revenues during 2008 increased 911 million or 8 percent over 2007 and increased 40 basis points as a percent of service revenues over the same period due primarily to the sales volume increase described above the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to lower performance in the commercial state  local business area in information technology 

 

2007  – cost of product sales during 2007 increased 65 million over 2006 while decreasing 80 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the same period the increase in cost of product sales is due largely to the sales volume increase described above while the margin rate improvement is primarily driven by improved program performance at aerospace and shipbuilding 

 

cost of service sales during 2007 increased 11 billion or 11 percent over 2006 while decreasing 210 basis points as a percentage of service sales over the same period cost of service revenues in 2007 increased over 2006 primarily due to higher sales volume at information  services 

 

general and administrative expenses  – in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts for most components of the company these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from 10 percent in 2007 to 96 percent in 2008 primarily as a result of costs remaining relatively constant while revenues increased over the same period in 2007 general and administrative expenses remained at a constant rate of approximately 10 percent of sales in 2007 and 2006 

 

goodwill impairment – in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company recorded a noncash charge totaling 31 billion at shipbuilding and space technology for the impairment of goodwill in accordance with 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed its required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of its businesses versus their book values the test as of november 30 2008 indicated that the book values for shipbuilding and space technology exceeded the fair values of these businesses the impairment charge is primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples and the company’s stock price as of november 30 2008 compared with the test performed as of november 30 2007 the charge reduces goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions made in 2001 and 2002 and does not impact the company’s normal business operations 

 

prior to recording the goodwill impairment charges at shipbuilding and space technology the company tested the purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets at both of these businesses as required by sfas no 144 – accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  and the carrying value of these assets were determined not to be impaired 

 

operating loss income 

the company considers operating income to be an important measure for evaluating its operating performance and as is typical in the industry defines operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses operating income for the company is further evaluated for each of the business segments in which the company operates 

 

management of the company internally manages its operations by reference to “segment operating income” segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment both of which do not affect the segments and the reversal of royalty income which is classified as other income for financial reporting purposes segment operating income is one of the key metrics management uses to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under us gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

 

 

 

segment operating loss income 

2008 – segment operating loss for the year ended december 31 2008 was 145 million as compared with segment operating income of 31 billion in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge totaling 31 billion at shipbuilding and space technology see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

2007  – segment operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 278 million or 10 percent as compared with 2006 total segment operating income was 98 percent and 95 percent of total sales and service revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

unallocated expenses 

2008 – unallocated expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 47 million or 23 percent as compared with the same period in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to 88 million in higher legal and investigative provisions recorded in 2007 partially offset by an increase in environmental health and welfare and other unallocated corporate costs in 2008 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

2007 – unallocated expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 81 million or 28 percent as compared with 2006 the decrease was primarily due to 98 million in lower postretirement benefit costs determined under gaap as a result of a plan design change in 2006 and 36 million lower legal and investigative provisions partially offset by an increase in other costs including 18 million in higher litigation expenses during the third quarter 2006 the company recorded a 1125 million pretax provision for its settlement offer to the us department of justice and a restricted customer 

 

net pension adjustment – the net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense determined in accordance with sfas no 87 – employer’s accounting for pensions us gaap pension expense and the pension expense allocated to the operating segments under cas the net pension adjustment increased income by 263 million and 127 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively as compared with an expense of 37 million in 2006 the income in 2008 and 2007 was due to decreased us gaap pension expense primarily resulting from better than estimated investment returns and higher discount rate assumptions 

 

due to adverse capital market conditions the company’s pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008 compared with a longterm estimated return of 85 percent as a result of 2008 actual plan returns the company estimates us gaap pension expense of 839 million in 2009 a substantial increase over the 2008 expense of 225 million the 2009 estimate is based on a 625 discount rate and a longterm rate of return of 85 percent 

 

interest expense 

2008  – interest expense decreased 41 million or 12 percent in 2008 as compared with 2007 the decrease is primarily due to the conversion and redemption of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in april 2008 which reduced the related dividends paid during the 2008 periods which were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income in part ii item 8 lower libor rates on the interest rate swap agreements also contributed to the decrease in interest expense 

 

2007 – interest expense decreased 11 million or 3 percent in 2007 as compared with 2006 the decrease is primarily due to a lower average debt balance 

 

other net 

2008 – other net for the year ended december 31 2008 was 38 million income an increase of 22 million as compared with 2007 primarily due to 59 million in royalty income from patent infringement settlements at electronics in 2008 partially offset by negative mark to market adjustments on investments in marketable securities used as a funding source for nonqualified employee benefits 

 

2007 – other net for the year ended december 31 2007 was 16 million income a decrease of 153 million as compared with 2006 during 2006 the company sold its remaining 97 million trw automotive trw auto shares generating pretax gains of 111 million 

 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2008 – the company’s effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 339 percent excluding the noncash nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at shipbuilding and space technology as compared with 329 percent in 2007 during 2008 the company recognized net tax benefits of 35 million primarily attributable to a settlement reached with the us internal revenue service irs and the congressional joint committee on taxation with respect to the irs audit of trw tax returns for the years 19992002 

 

2007 – the company’s effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 was 329 percent compared with 312 percent in 2006 during 2007 the company reached a partial settlement agreement with the irs regarding its audit of the company’s tax years ended 20012003 resulting in a tax benefit of 22 million

diluted loss earnings per share 

2008 – diluted loss per share from continuing operations for 2008 was 383 per share as compared with 518 diluted earnings per share in 2007 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3345 million for 2008 and 3543 million for 2007 for the year ended december 31 2008 the potential dilutive effect of 71 million shares from stock options stock awards and the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from the computation of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding as the shares would have had an antidilutive effect the goodwill impairment charge of 31 billion at shipbuilding and space technology reduced the company’s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 904 per share 

 

2007  – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2007 was 518 per share an increase of 15 percent from 451 per share in 2006 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3543 million for 2007 and 3586 million for 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effects of stock options stock awards and the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock all of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock by april 2008 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2008 – net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased 321 million as compared with 2007 and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade working capital reductions pension plan contributions totaled 320 million in 2008 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded and were comparable to 2007 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 included 113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 23 million of interest income 

 

2007  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased 11 billion as compared with 2006 and reflects lower pension contributions higher net earnings and continued trade working capital reductions pension plan contributions totaled 342 million in 2007 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded compared with contributions of 12 billion in 2006 of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 included the receipt of 125 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane katrina 52 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 21 million of interest

segment operating results 

 

 

 

realignments  – the company from time to time acquires or disposes of businesses and realigns contracts programs or business areas among or within its operating segments that possess similar customers expertise and capabilities these realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services during the second quarter of 2008 the company transferred certain programs and assets from the missiles business in the mission systems segment to the space technology segment in january 2008 the newport news and ship systems businesses were realigned into a single segment called northrop grumman shipbuilding previously these businesses were separate operating segments which were aggregated into a single segment for financial reporting purposes in addition certain electronics businesses were transferred to mission systems during the first quarter of 2008 the operating results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect these changes see a description of the segment business areas and specific realignments located in part i item 1 

 

subsequent realignments  – in january 2009 the company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing the number of reporting segments from seven to five the five segments are aerospace systems which combines the former integrated systems and space technology segments electronic systems information systems which combines the former information technology and mission systems segments shipbuilding and technical services the creation of the aerospace systems and information systems segments strengthens alignment with customers improves the company’s ability to execute on programs and win new business and enhances cost competitiveness this subsequent realignment is not reflected in any of the accompanying financial information

key segment financial measures 

 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

the company manages and assesses the performance of its businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described on page 32 based on this approach and the nature of the company’s operations the discussion of consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the company’s seven reporting segments versus distinguishing between products and services product sales are predominantly generated in the electronics integrated systems space technology and shipbuilding segments while the majority of the company’s service revenues are generated by the information technology mission systems and technical services segments 

 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the performance of segment contracts excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far and therefore not allocated to the segments changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 

 

operating income may also be affected by among other things the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

raw materials 

 

the most significant raw material required by the company is steel used primarily for shipbuilding the company has mitigated supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with a number of steel suppliers in addition the company has mitigated price risk related to its steel purchases through certain contractual arrangements with the us government while the company has generally been able to obtain key raw materials required in its production processes in a timely manner a significant delay in receipt of these supplies by the company could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

government regulation 

 

the company’s business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in part i item 1a

employee relations 

 

the company believes that it maintains good relations with its 122600 employees of which approximately 17 percent are covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements the company expects to renegotiate nine of its collective bargaining agreements in 2008 it is not expected that the results of these negotiations will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations see risk factors in part i item 1a 

 

environmental matters 

 

federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations the company has provided for the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where the company has determined it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

 

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company on a sitebysite basis such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before it has determined that collection is probable 

 

management estimates that at december 31 2007 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation sites is 186 million to 285 million of which 223 million is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties the company provides environmental accruals based upon its expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities in addition should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued which could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the company has made the investments it believes necessary in order to comply with environmental laws

competitive conditions 

 

northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which is generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas the company’s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets see risk factors in part i item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within the company’s control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance information contained within this form 10k should be carefully considered by investors in light of the risk factors described below 

 

  

approximately 90 percent of the company’s revenues during 2007 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and are therefore affected by among other things the federal budget process the company is a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies these contracts are subject to the respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards and in the case of contracts with the us government the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes the us government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements the termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the us government could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or prospects 

 

in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred the company is involved as a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning a contract terminated for convenience see other matters in part i item 3 termination resulting from the company’s default could expose the company to liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to compete for contracts 

 

in addition a material amount of the company’s revenues and profits is derived from programs that are subject to security classification restrictions restricted business which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details about these programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors might have less insight into the company’s restricted business than other businesses of the company or could experience less ability to evaluate fully the risks disputes or claims associated with restricted business 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency a loss of business to the company’s competitors could have a material adverse affect on the company’s ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 

  

the company designs develops and manufactures technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by its customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent the company from achieving contractual requirements 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

in addition the company’s products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure problems with quality country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received by the company 

 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected the company has not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with such contract performance incentive provisions however if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

  

operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to customers are incurred this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins approximately 30 percent of the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixedprice contracts – see contracts in part ii item 7 flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees including cost sharing agreements and negative performance incentives the company typically enters into fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition certain contracts other than fixedprice contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in those contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of the company’s fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of fixedprice development contracts which include production units is subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development contracts future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of the company’s significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system program for the wedgetail and peace eagle contracts both of which are performed by the electronics segment it is also not unusual in the ships business for the company to negotiate fixedprice 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

production followon contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing flexibly priced development contracts 

 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of the company’s contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

 

because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

the company has thousands of contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to us and foreign laws and regulations prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

in addition international business subjects the company to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on the company changes in regulation or political environment may affect the company’s ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

 

the company operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited by the us government and others on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with all applicable government regulations negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments from time to time the company is subject to us government investigations relating to its operations government contractors that are found to have violated the law such as the false claims act or the arms export control act or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law may be subject to significant fines such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

contracting for some period of time given the company’s dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

  

the company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors as well as other factors that may cause operating results to be adversely affected changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract which could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to compete for future contracts 

 

operating results are heavily dependent upon the company’s ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skill sets andor security clearances the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements and avoidance of organized work stoppages are also critical to the ongoing operations of the company 

 

the company has significant operations located in regions of the us that may be exposed to damaging storms and other natural disasters while preventative measures typically help to minimize harm to the company the damage and disruption resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be significant although no assurances can be made the company believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters through insurance or its contracts 

 

natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt electrical and other power distribution networks and cause adverse effects on profitability and performance including computer and internet operation and accessibility computer viruses and similar harmful software programs as well as network outages disruptions and attacks also may have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability and performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented 

 

  

as part of its overall strategy the company will from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business these investments are made upon careful target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price after acquisition unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates goodwill accounts for approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets the company evaluates goodwill amounts for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a significant decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

 

  

the size and complexity of the company’s business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation the company is subject to environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established accruals could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see legal proceedings in part i item 3 and critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in part ii item 7 

 

  

a substantial portion of the company’s current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon the company’s various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

the company endeavors to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption not every risk or liability can be protected against by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred in some but not all circumstances the company may receive indemnification from the us government because of the limitations in overall available coverage referred to above the company may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations and its overall consolidated financial position additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and where litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to the company may have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

the company like others in the defense industry is aware of a potential problem presented by strict compliance with the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically or from certain foreign countries subcontractors and lowertier suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply with the rule as written subject to limitations inability to certify that all enumerated specialty metals in a product comply with sourcing requirements can lead to us government customers withholding a portion of a payment on delivery or may prevent delivery altogether of materiel and products critical to national defense

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

us government investigations and claims  – departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or an operating division or subdivision suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on government contracts

overview 

 

business 

northrop grumman provides technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions in information and services aerospace electronics and shipbuilding to its global customers as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier northrop grumman participates in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the us and abroad northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government principally the dod the company also conducts business with local state and foreign governments and has domestic and international commercial sales 

 

notable events 

certain notable events or activity affecting the company’s 2007 consolidated financial results included the following 

  

outlook 

us defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget forecasts and funds being utilized to support the ongoing global war on terrorism despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in 2008 and beyond based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 64 billion as of december 31 2007 the company expects sales in 2008 of approximately 33 billion and forecasts improvement in net income over 2007 the major industry and economic factors that may affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

 

industry factors 

northrop grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

similarly there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which is generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas the company’s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals many requiring security clearances at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets accordingly various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets 

 

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts or threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification national responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations or peacekeeping the us government continues to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and in minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives as a result the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth longrange survivability persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access additionally advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms will also be required 

 

while the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow defense requirements are not expected to change significantly in the foreseeable future many allied countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with us forces the size of future us and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment the proposed 2009 budget provides 5154 billion in discretionary authority for the dod base budget representing a 359 billion or 75 percent increase over the enacted level for fiscal 2008 this proposed budget includes reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete however the company believes that spending on recapitalization and modernization of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence persistent surveillance cyber space and nonconventional warfare capabilities 

 

us government programs in which the company either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of the company and the entire defense industry 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include a new aerial refueling tanker the nextgeneration longrange bomber space radar unmanned vehicles satellite communications systems restricted programs technical services and information technology contracts and several international and homeland security programs in pursuit of these opportunities northrop grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2008 and beyond 

 

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne and space surveillance battle management systems integration defense electronics and information technology the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr and missile systems the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense nevertheless under budgetary pressures there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated by the company’s us government customers 

 

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 

 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

contracts 

 

the majority of the company’s business is generated from longterm government contracts for development production and service activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations and advertising costs 

 

the company’s longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

flexibly priced contracts  – includes both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

 

firm fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 

 

the following table summarizes 2007 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

 

 

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

 

positive award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company’s operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei sdd e2d sdd lpd and ddg1000 programs 

 

compliance and monitoring  – on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

 

revenue recognition 

overview  – the majority of the company’s business is derived from longterm contracts for the construction of facilities production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 45 – accounting for longterm constructiontype contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 811 – accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  and the aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts the company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers the company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 

 

the company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – the company generally recognizes revenues from its longterm contracts under the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the ships segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 

 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of its products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment sales under costtype contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 

 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

certain service contracts  – revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in the information and services business revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

 

service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 0021 – revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  – the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

acquisition accruals  – the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience 

 

goodwill  – the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30th of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

 

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company’s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 

 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview  – the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

 

environmental accruals  – the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated factors which could result in changes to the company’s assessment of probability range of loss and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

contamination than anticipated results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operation or cash flows 

 

litigation accruals  – litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available the company believes that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

uncertain tax positions – effective january 1 2007 the company measures and records uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 48 – accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return only tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax return of the company the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 prior to 2007 the company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority under existing gaap changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies of acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

 

retirement benefits 

overview  – assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

 

assumptions  – the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable such as real estate private equity investments and hedge funds estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 

 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical longterm bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments

for each benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above the company’s weightedaverage pension composite discount rate was 622 percent at december 31 2007 and 597 percent at december 31 2006 

 

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2007 and 2006 the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent 

 

changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impacts on 2007 pension and other postretirement benefits results 

 

 

 

health care cost trend rates  – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants for 2007 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 8 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent in 2006 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 875 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent 

 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2007 postretirement benefit results

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

 

 

 

2007  – revenues for principal product businesses in aerospace electronics and ships during 2007 grew at a combined rate of approximately 3 percent over 2006 reflecting sales growth in electronics and ships partially offset by reduced sales in aerospace the sales growth at electronics and ships was due to volume improvements across most business areas while the sales reduction in aerospace was anticipated as a number of contracts transitioned from development to production in 2007 revenue for principal services businesses in information  services during 2007 grew approximately 11 percent over 2006 due largely to double digit growth at information technology and technical services segments resulting from increased volume on contracts that were newly awarded in 2006 and growth across the board on other contracts 

 

2006  – revenues for the principal product segments of integrated systems space technology and electronics were relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005 and revenues for the ships segment declined approximately 500 million due primarily to the effects of the damage to the gulf coast shipyards caused by hurricane katrina in august 2005 service revenues for the principal services businesses grew principally in the information technology and technical services segments which each had revenue increases in excess of 225 million in 2006 revenues for mission systems the company’s other mainly services business were relatively flat on a year over year basis 

 

cost of sales and general and administrative expenses 

cost of sales and general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

cost of product sales and service revenues 

2007  – cost of product sales during 2007 increased 94 million or 1 percent over 2006 while decreasing 90 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the same period cost of service sales during 2007 increased 11 billion or 11 percent over 2006 while decreasing 214 basis points as a percentage of service sales over the same period cost of product sales in 2007 increased over 2006 due largely to the sales volume increase described above partially offset by improved program performance at integrated systems space technology and ships cost of service revenues in 2007 increased over 2006 due primarily to higher sales volume at information  services the margin rate improvement was primarily driven by improved margin rate performance on service revenues by segments principally in the product businesses 

 

2006  – cost of product sales during 2006 decreased 12 billion or 7 percent over 2005 while decreasing 160 basis points as a percentage of product sales over the same period cost of service sales during 2006 increased 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

887 million or 9 percent over 2005 while decreasing 164 basis points as a percentage of service sales over the same period cost of product sales in 2006 declined over 2005 due largely to the sales volume decreases described above improved program performance across all of the principal product segments and the absence of contract charges from hurricane katrina cost of product sales in 2005 included charges of 165 million due to the impacts of hurricane katrina on ship construction contracts in process when the hurricane occurred in august 2005 cost of service revenues increased in 2006 due to higher volume at information technology and technical services partially offset by improved cost performance at mission systems  technical services 

 

general and administrative expenses  – in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts and such costs for most components of the company are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations general and administrative expenses remained at a constant rate of approximately 10 percent of sales in 2007 and 2006 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 96 percent in 2005 to 101 percent in 2006 the increase in 2006 is due primarily to higher property insurance litigation and bid and proposal costs partially offset by lower ird 

 

operating margin 

the company considers operating margin to be an important measure for evaluating its operating performance and as is typical in the industry defines operating margin as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses operating margin for the company is further evaluated for each of the business segments in which the company operates and “segment operating margin” is one of the key metrics used by management of the company to internally manage its operations 

 

operating margin represents segment operating margin see section entitled segment operating results adjusted for a number of factors that do not affect the segments as follows 

 

 

 

segment operating margin 

2007  – segment operating margin for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 296 million or 11 percent as compared to the same period in 2006 total segment operating margin was 97 percent and 93 percent of total sales and service revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

2006  – segment operating margin for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 386 million or 16 percent as compared to the same period in 2005 total segment operating margin was 93 percent and 81 percent of total sales and service revenues for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively see the segment operating results section below for further information 

 

unallocated expenses – unallocated expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 82 million or 27 percent as compared with the same period in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to 98 million in lower postretirement benefit costs determined under gaap as a result of a plan design change in 2006 and 36 million lower legal and investigative provisions partially offset by an increase in other costs including 18 million in higher litigation expenses during the third quarter 2006 the company recorded a 1125 million pretax provision for its settlement offer to the us department of justice and a restricted customer 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

net pension adjustment – the net pension adjustment reflects the excess pension expense determined in accordance with gaap over the pension expense allocated to the operating segments under cas the net pension adjustment increased income by 127 million in 2007 as compared with an expense of 37 million and 21 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the reduction in 2007 gaap pension cost primarily results from higher returns on plan assets and a voluntary prefunding in the fourth quarter of 2006 

 

interest expense net 

interest expense net for 2007 was comparable to 2006 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2006 was 303 million a decrease of 31 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared with 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a lower average debt balance in 2006 resulting from debt maturities totaling 12 billion in 2006 

 

other net 

2007 – other net for the year ended december 31 2007 was 12 million expense a decrease of 137 million as compared with 2006 during 2006 the company sold its remaining 97 million trw automotive trw auto shares generating pretax gains of 111 million 

 

2006 – other net for the year ended december 31 2006 was 125 million income a decrease of 74 million or 37 percent from 2005 income of 199 million during 2005 the company sold 73 million trw auto shares and approximately 34 million endwave shares which generated pretax gains of 70 million and 95 million respectively as compared to the 111 million pretax gain in 2006 resulting from the sale of the remaining trw auto stock 

 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2007 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 was 33 percent compared with 31 percent in 2006 during 2007 the company reached a partial settlement agreement with the us internal revenue service irs regarding its audit of the company’s tax years ended 2001 – 2003 resulting in a tax benefit of 22 million 

 

2006 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2006 and 2005 was 31 percent and 32 percent respectively during 2006 the company received final approval from the us congress joint committee on taxation for the agreement previously reached with the irs regarding its audits of the company’s b2 program for the years ended december 31 1997 through december 31 2000 as a result of the agreement the company recognized tax benefits of 48 million due to the reversal of previously established expense provisions the company also recognized a net tax benefit of 18 million in 2006 related to tax credits associated with qualified wages paid to employees affected by hurricane katrina 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

2007  – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2007 was 516 per share an increase of 16 percent from 446 per share in 2006 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3543 million for 2007 and 3586 million for 2006 the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share includes the dilutive impact of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 

 

2006  – diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2006 was 446 per share an increase of 16 percent from 384 per share in 2005 earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 3586 million for 2006 and 3632 million for 2005 for 2006 weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share includes the dilutive impact of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2007  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased 11 billion as compared with 2006 and reflects lower pension contributions higher net income and continued trade working capital reductions pension plan contributions totaled 342 million in 2007 of which 200 million was voluntarily prefunded compared 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

with contributions of 12 billion in 2006 of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded cash collected from customers increased by 2 billion and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by 635 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 

 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 included the receipt of 125 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane katrina 52 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 21 million of interest 

 

2006  – net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 decreased 871 million as compared with 2005 primarily due to contributions to the company’s pension plans cash collected from customers decreased by 166 million and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by 361 million in 2006 as compared with 2005 net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 included the receipt of 100 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane katrina 60 million of federal and state income tax refunds and 45 million of interest net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 includes contributions to the company’s pension plans totaling 12 billion of which 800 million was voluntarily prefunded as compared to contributions of 415 million in 2005 of which 203 million was voluntarily prefunded 

 

segment operating results 

 

 

 

realignments  – the company from time to time will realign contracts programs or business areas among or within its operating segments that possess similar customers expertise and capabilities these realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services in january 2007 certain programs and business areas were transferred among information technology mission systems space technology and technical services the operating results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect these changes see a description of the segment business areas and specific realignments located in part i item 1 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

subsequent realignments – in january 2008 the newport news and ship systems sectors were realigned into a single segment called northrop grumman shipbuilding to enable the company to more effectively utilize its shipbuilding assets and deploy its talented shipbuilders processes technologies production facilities and planned capital investment to meet customer needs this realignment had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or segment reporting 

 

also in january 2008 the company announced the transfer of certain programs and assets from the mission systems segment to the space technology segment effective july 1 2008 this transfer will allow mission systems to focus on the rapidly growing command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance business and the missiles business will be an integrated element of the company’s aerospace business growth strategy in addition certain electronics businesses were transferred to mission systems effective january 2008 the transfer of these businesses is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

these subsequent realignments have not been reflected in any of the accompanying financial information 

 

key segment financial measures 

 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

the company manages and assesses the performance of its businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described on page 29 based on this approach and the nature of the company’s operations the discussion of consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the company’s seven reportable segments versus distinguishing between products and services product sales are predominantly generated in the electronics integrated systems space technology and ships segments while the majority of the company’s service revenues are generated by the information technology mission systems and technical services segments 

 

funded contract acquisitions 

funded contract acquisitions represent amounts funded during the period on customer contractually obligated orders funded contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from period to period and are determined by the size and timing of new and followon orders and by obligations of funding on previously awarded unfunded orders in the period that a business is purchased its existing funded order backlog as of the date of purchase is reported as funded contract acquisitions in the period that a business is sold its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from funded contract acquisitions 

 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales generally vary less than funded contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in revenues incurred due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding margin change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

 

segment operating margin 

segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far and therefore not allocated to the segments changes in segment operating margin are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating margin changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

operating margin may also be affected by among other things the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

environmental matters 

 

federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations the company has provided for the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where the company has determined it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

 

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company on a sitebysite basis such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before it has determined that collection is probable 

 

management estimates that at december 31 2006 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation sites is 224 million to 319 million of which 257 million is accrued in “other current liabilities” in the consolidated statements of financial position environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties the company provides environmental accruals based upon its expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities in addition should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued which could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the company has made the investments it believes necessary in order to comply with environmental laws 

 

competitive condition 

 

northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations see “risk factors” in part i item 1a

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

  

  

approximately 90 percent of the company’s revenues during 2006 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and are therefore affected by among other things the federal budget process the company is a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies these contracts are subject to the respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards and in the case of contracts with the us government the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes the government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default as well as other risks such as contractor 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements the termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the us government could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or prospects 

 

in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to termination the company is involved in a lawsuit concerning a contract terminated for convenience see “other matters” in part i item 3 termination resulting from the company’s default could expose the company to liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to compete for contracts 

 

in addition a material amount of the company’s revenues and profits is derived from programs that are subject to security classification restrictions restricted business which could limit the company’s ability to discuss details about these programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors might have less insight into the company’s restricted business than other businesses of the company or could experience less ability to evaluate fully the risks disputes or claims associated with restricted business 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency a loss of business to our competitors could have a material adverse affect on the company’s ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share 

 

  

the company designs develops and manufactures technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent the company from achieving contractual requirements 

 

in addition the company’s products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure problems with quality country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen liabilities loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received by the company 

 

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected the company has not experienced any material losses in the last decade in connection with contract performance incentive provisions however if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

  

operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to customers are incurred this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins approximately 34 percent of the company’s annual revenues are derived from fixedprice contracts – see “contracts” in part ii item 7 flexibly priced contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees and negative performance incentives the company typically enters into fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition certain contracts other than fixedprice contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in those contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced 

 

fixedprice development work comprises a small portion of the company’s fixedprice contracts and inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced in addition successful performance of fixedprice development contracts which include production units is subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development programs future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of the company’s significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system program for the wedgetail and peace eagle contracts both of which are performed by the electronics segment it is also not unusual in the ships business for the company to negotiate fixedprice production followon contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing flexibly priced development contracts 

 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of the company’s contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

 

because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in part ii item 7 

 

  

the company has thousands of contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to us and foreign laws and regulations prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

in addition international business subjects the company to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on the company changes in regulation or political environment may affect the company’s ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

 

the company operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited by the us government and others on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with all applicable government regulations negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments from time to time the company is subject to us government investigations relating to its operations government contractors that are found to have violated the law such as the false claims act or the arms export control act or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law may be subject to significant fines such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting for some period of time given the company’s dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

  

the company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors as well as other factors that may cause operating results to be adversely affected changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations 

 

performance failures by a subcontractor of the company or difficulty in maintaining complete alignment of the subcontractor’s obligations with the company’s prime contract obligations may adversely affect the company’s ability to perform its obligations on the prime contract which could reduce the company’s profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from the customer and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to compete for future contracts 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the company has significant operations located in regions of the us where damaging storms and other natural disasters are somewhat common while preventative measures typically help to minimize harm to the company the damage and disruption resulting from certain storms or other natural disasters may be significant although no assurances can be made the company believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters through insurance or its contracts 

 

natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes can disrupt electrical and other power distribution networks and cause adverse effects on profitability and performance including computer and internet operation and accessibility computer viruses and similar harmful software programs as well as network outages disruptions and attacks also may have a material adverse affect on the company’s profitability and performance unless quarantined or otherwise prevented 

 

  

as part of its overall strategy the company will from time to time acquire a minority or majority interest in a business these investments are made upon careful target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price after acquisition unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchased price even after careful integration efforts actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates 

 

goodwill accounts for approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in part ii item 7 

 

  

the size and complexity of the company’s business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation the company is subject to environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established accruals could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 and “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in part ii item 7 

 

  

a substantial portion of the company’s current and retired employee population is covered by pension and postretirement benefit plans the costs of which are dependent upon the company’s various assumptions including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs variances from these estimates could have a material adverse affect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

  

primarily as a result of the major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 including hurricanes katrina and rita market conditions have substantially changed resulting in an overall reduced amount of total available coverage the company endeavors to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including among others natural disasters products liability and business interruption not every risk or liability can be protected against by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred in some but not all circumstances the company may receive indemnification from the us government because of the reduction in overall available coverage referred to above the company may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations and its overall consolidated financial position additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and where litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to the company may have a material adverse affect on the company’s consolidated results of operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

  

the company like others in the defense industry is aware of a potential problem presented by strict compliance with the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement preference for enumerated specialty metals sourced domestically or from certain foreign countries subcontractors and lowertier suppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply with the rule as written particularly for lowvalue parts such as washers screws nuts bolts resistors and capacitors subject to limitations inability to certify that all enumerated specialty metals in a product comply with sourcing requirements can lead to us government customers withholding a portion of a payment on delivery or may prevent delivery altogether of materiel and products critical to national defense

overview 

 

business 

northrop grumman provides technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions in information and services aerospace electronics and shipbuilding to its global customers as a system integrator prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier northrop grumman participates in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states us and abroad northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government principally the department of defense dod the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 

 

outlook 

us defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget forecasts and funds being diverted to support the ongoing global war on terrorism and the reordering of priorities by the dod despite this trend the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and integrated solutions in systems integration defense electronics information technology advanced aircraft shipbuilding technical services and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2007 and beyond in 2007 based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 61 billion as of december 31 2006 the company expects sales to range between 31 and 32 billion and forecasts improvement in net income over 2006 the major industry and economic factors that may affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

 

industry factors 

while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the defense marketplace it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry as a monopsony and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

 

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

 

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts or threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification national responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations or peacekeeping the us government continues to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and in minimizing collateral damage when force 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

must be applied in pursuit of national objectives as a result the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth longrange survivability persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access additionally advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms will also be required 

 

while the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow us budgets are expected to continue to exhibit real growth in the coming years while defense spending in allied countries may not match that growth many of those allies are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with us forces of note the 2006 quadrennial defense review increased the dod focus on intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr and joint command and control in support of future budget submissions the size of future us and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment the 2008 budget submitted by the president requests 4814 billion in discretionary authority for the dod base budget including 1417 billion to continue the fight in the global war on terrorism representing an 113 percent increase over the projected enacted level for fiscal 2007 while this budget includes proposed reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence and nonconventional warfare capabilities 

 

us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry despite significant growth in the defense budget since 2001 the percent of gross domestic product dedicated to the nation’s defense has remained relatively constant 

 

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include a new aerial refueling tanker the nextgeneration longrange bomber space radar unmanned vehicles transformational satellite communications systems restricted spacebased programs technical services and information technology contracts and several international and homeland security programs in pursuit of these opportunities northrop grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2007 and beyond 

 

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne surveillance battle management systems integration defense electronics and information technology the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr and missile systems the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense nevertheless under budgetary pressures and emphasis on capabilities to conduct nonconventional warfare there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated by our us government customers 

 

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 

 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

contracts 

 

the majority of the company’s business is generated from longterm government contracts for development production and service activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations and advertising costs 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

the company’s longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

flexibly priced contracts  – includes both costtype and fixedprice incentive contracts costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixedprice incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit which affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

 

firm fixedprice contracts  – a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 

 

the following table summarizes 2006 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

 

 

 

contract fees  – negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and fixedprice contracts may include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

 

positive award fees  – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical ingenuity award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company’s operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kinetic energy interceptor kei f35 sdd e2d sdd lpd and ddg1000 programs 

 

compliance and monitoring  – on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

 

the company’s significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements see in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as part of its oversight responsibilities management evaluates the propriety of its estimates judgments and accounting methods as new events occur management believes that its policies judgments and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company’s consolidated financial statements with a fair presentation of information in all material respects in accordance with gaap management periodically reviews the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

revenue recognition 

overview  – the majority of the company’s business is derived from longterm contracts for the construction of facilities production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 45 – accounting for longterm constructiontype contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 811 – accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  and the aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts 

 

the company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the construction of facilities production of goods and services provided to the federal government such as contracts to provide certain services to nonfederal government customers the company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 

 

the company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

 

percentageofcompletion accounting  – the company generally recognizes revenue from its longterm contracts under the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the ships segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales value in accordance with the contract terms the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the life of the contract based on deliveries 

 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of its products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment sales under costtype contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 

 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

 

certain service contracts  – revenue under contracts to provide services to nonfederal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcingtype arrangements primarily in the information and services business revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred except that direct and incremental setup costs 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 

 

service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 0021 – revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  accordingly for applicable arrangements revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 

 

cost estimation  – the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  – the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding a twelve month period with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

 

acquisition accruals  – the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience and consultation with outside valuation specialists 

 

goodwill  – the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually in november or when evidence of potential impairment exists in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets  in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

 

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value growth rate assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company’s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the company’s recorded goodwill differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview  – the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

 

while the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters resolution of one or more of these matters either individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

environmental accruals  – the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated factors which could result in changes to the company’s assessment of probability range of loss and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology 

 

litigation accruals  – litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

 

tax contingency accruals – the company records accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from preacquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined effective january 1 2007 the company will measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 – accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

retirement benefits 

overview  – assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

 

assumptions  – the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

discount rate  – the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical longterm bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above the company’s composite discount rate was 6 percent at december 31 2006 and 575 percent at december 31 2005 

 

expected longterm rate of return  – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2006 and 2005 the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent 

 

changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impacts on 2006 pension and other postretirement benefits results 

 

 

 

health care cost trend rates  – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants for 2006 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 875 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent in 2005 the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 10 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent 

 

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2006 postretirement benefit results 

 

 

 

management financial measures 

 

the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures 

 

contract acquisitions  – contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and followon orders in the year that a business is purchased its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions in the year that a business is sold its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from contract acquisitions 

 

sales  – yeartoyear sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts for further information related to revenue recognition refer to the revenue recognition discussion included in the “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” section of this part ii item 7 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

 

segment operating margin  – segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the federal acquisition regulation and therefore not allocated to the segments 

 

backlog  – funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders for multiyear services contracts with nonfederal government customers having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

 

consolidated operating results 

 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

 

 

 

sales and service revenues 

2006  – sales in 2006 increased 81 million as compared with 2005 the increase was primarily due to increased revenues in the information technology and technical services segments partially offset by decreased revenues at the ships segment information technology segment sales increased 260 million due to new business primarily from the virginia and san diego county information technology outsourcing contracts and higher sales volume in the united kingdom whole life support programme and the systems and software engineering services program technical services segment revenues increased 256 million primarily due to new business from the nevada test site program ships segment sales decreased 465 million due primarily to decreased volume in the ddg 1000 program formerly known as the ddx program and continued recovery from the impact of hurricane katrina see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

 

2005  – sales in 2005 increased 11 billion or 4 percent over 2004 due to increased revenue in each of the company’s operating segments except ships including sales growth of 19 percent at integrated systems the increase at integrated systems was due primarily to higher volume in the e2d advanced hawkeye ea18g unmanned systems b2 and multiplatform radar technology insertion program mprtip programs partially offset by lower volume in the fa18 and joint stars programs ships segment sales decreased 7 percent in 2005 due primarily to decreased volume in the ddg 1000 and lhd programs and hurricane katrinarelated work delays

operating margin 

operating margin represents segment operating margin see section entitled “segment operating results” adjusted for a number of factors that do not affect the segments as follows 

 

 

 

unallocated expenses  – unallocated expenses increased 97 million or 51 percent in 2006 as compared with 2005 the increase in unallocated expenses is primarily due to a 1125 million pretax legal provision recorded in 2006 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 unallocated expenses decreased 92 million or 33 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 the decrease was primarily due to lower legal costs in 2005 as the 2004 legal costs included provisions related to the resolution of the allison gas turbine and robinson litigations 

 

also included in unallocated expenses is the cost of medical and life benefits to the extent not currently recoverable under cas in november 2006 the company adopted plan amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that were previously not subject to limits on the company’s contributions the change in benefits announced in november 2006 reduced benefit costs by approximately 17 million in 2006 in addition this change reduced the company’s aggregate benefit obligation by approximately 465 million at december 31 2006 subsequent to january 1 2005 or earlier at some sectors newly hired employees are not eligible for post employment medical and life benefits 

 

net pension expense adjustment  – the net pension expense adjustment reflects the excess pension expense determined in accordance with gaap over the pension expense allocated to the operating segments under cas the net pension expense adjustment increased to 37 million in 2006 as compared with 21 million in 2005 and increased 9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 both increases reflect the timing of cost recognition between gaap and cas 

 

for 2007 subject to refinements for participant census data and payasyougo plans management expects the net pension expense adjustment to total approximately 70 million in income primarily due to an increase in the discount rate voluntary prefunding during 2006 and higher than expected return on plan assets during 2006 the 2007 pension plan assumptions include an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent and a composite discount rate of 6 percent 

 

reversal of royalty income  – royalty income is included in segment operating margin for internal reporting purposes this amount is reversed in the table above to arrive at operating margin as determined in accordance with gaap as royalty income is included in the “other net” line item discussed below 

 

net interest expense 

2006  – net interest expense decreased 31 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared with 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a lower average debt balance in 2006 resulting from debt maturities totaling 12 billion in 2006 

 

2005 – net interest expense decreased 39 million or 10 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a lower average debt balance in 2005 resulting from a 600 million reduction in debt in the fourth quarter of 2004 

 

northrop grumman corporation 

other net 

2006  – other net decreased 75 million or 38 percent from 2005 income of 200 million during 2006 the company sold its remaining 97 million trw automotive trw auto shares generating pretax gains of 111 million which were partially offset by losses on other equity investments 

 

2005  – other net increased 218 million from 2004 expense of 18 million due primarily to the sale of 73 million trw auto shares and approximately 34 million endwave shares which generated pretax gains of 70 million and 95 million respectively 

 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2006  – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2006 was 31 percent during 2006 the company received final approval from the us congress joint committee on taxation for the agreement previously reached with the internal revenue service irs regarding its audits of the company’s b2 program for the years ended december 31 1997 through december 31 2000 as a result of the agreement the company recognized tax benefits of 48 million due to the reversal of previously established expense provisions the company also recognized a net tax benefit of 18 million in 2006 related to tax credits associated with qualified wages paid to employees affected by hurricane katrina the effective tax rate for 2007 is expected to be between 33 and 34 percent 

 

2005  – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2005 and 2004 was 32 percent during 2005 the company recognized a 20 million net tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of irs appeals cases related to alternative minimum tax credits for tax years 1981 through 1996

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

patents developed while under contract with the us government may be subject to use by the us government in addition the company licenses intellectual property to and from third parties management believes the company’s ability to conduct its operations would not be materially affected by the loss of any particular intellectual property right 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

seasonality 

  

no material portion of the company’s business is considered to be seasonal the timing of revenue recognition is determined upon several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs cost estimation and unit deliveries see “revenue recognition” in part ii item 7 

  

raw materials 

  

the most significant raw material required by the company is steel used primarily for ship building the company has mitigated supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with a number of steel suppliers in addition the company has mitigated price risk related to its steel purchases through certain contractual arrangements with the us government while the company has generally been able to obtain key raw materials required in its production processes in a timely manner a significant delay in receipt of these supplies by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

government regulation 

  

the company’s business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see “risk factors” below 

  

certain programs with the us government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in detail are referred to as “restricted” in this form 10k the consolidated financial statements and financial information contained within this form 10k reflect the operating results of restricted programs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs ird expenses are included in general and administrative expenses and are allocated to us government contracts companysponsored research and development expenses totaled 538 million 504 million and 429 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively expenses for research and development sponsored by the customer are charged directly to the related contracts 

  

employee relations 

  

the company believes that it maintains good relations with its 123600 employees of which approximately 19 percent are covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements the company expects to renegotiate 2 collective bargaining agreements in 2006 it is not expected that these negotiations will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations the company has provided for the estimated cost to complete remediation where the company has determined that it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impact at current or formerly owned operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies it 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the status of the law regulations and their interpretations 

  

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company on a sitebysite basis such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before it has determined that collection is probable 

  

management estimates that at december 31 2005 the range of reasonably possible future costs for all environmental remediation sites is 256 million to 362 million of which 281 million has been accrued environmental accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties the company provides environmental accruals based upon its expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities in addition should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued which could have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the company has made the investments it believes necessary in order to comply with environmental laws

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within the company’s control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance information contained within this form 10k should be carefully considered by investors in light of the risk factors described below 

  

   

approximately 90 percent of the company’s revenues during 2005 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and are therefore affected by among other things the federal budget process the company is a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies these contracts are subject to the respective customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards and in the case of contracts with the us government the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes the government’s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements the termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the us government could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to termination the company is involved in a lawsuit concerning a contract terminated for convenience see “other matters” in part i item 3 

  

   

the company designs develops and manufactures technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent the company from achieving contractual requirements 

  

in addition the company’s products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems which could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft premature failure problems with quality country of origin or delivery of subcontractor components or services or unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen liabilities loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of progress payments and award fees 

  

certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time under such terms the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected the company has not experienced any significant losses in the last decade in connection with contract performance incentive provisions however if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

   

operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred this cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect or if estimates to complete increase the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than costtype contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins approximately 35 percent of the company’s contracts are fixedprice – see “contracts” in part ii item 7 costtype contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees and negative performance incentives the company typically enters into fixedprice contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience in addition certain contracts other than fixedprice contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights should the terms specified in those contracts not be met then profitability may be reduced 

  

fixedprice development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are reduced in addition successful performance of fixedprice development contracts which include production units is subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development programs future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of the company’s significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system for the australian defence force’s project wedgetail program both of which are performed by the electronic systems segment it is also not unusual in the ships segment for the company to negotiate fixedprice production followon contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing contracts examples of negotiated fixedprice programs with followon production options are the polar tanker program and the virginiaclass submarine program 

  

   

the company has thousands of contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to us and foreign laws and regulations prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

in addition international business subjects the company to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions repatriation of earnings exchange controls the foreign corrupt practices act and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act failure by the company or its sales representatives or consultants to 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities and could in the extreme case result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of the company’s export privileges which could have a material effect on the company changes in regulation or political environment may affect the company’s ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

  

the company operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited by the us government and others on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with all applicable government regulations negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments from time to time the company is subject to us government investigations relating to its operations government contractors that are found to have violated the law such as the false claims act or the arms export control act or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law may be subject to significant fines such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting for some period of time given the company’s dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

   

the company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors as well as other factors that may cause operating results to be adversely affected operating results are also dependent on successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations 

  

the company has significant operations located in regions of the united states where damaging storms are somewhat common while preventative measures typically help to minimize harm to the company the damage and disruption resulting from certain storms may be significant although no assurances can be made the company believes it can recover costs associated with natural disasters through insurance or its contracts 

  

   

goodwill accounts for approximately half of the company’s recorded total assets the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment principally a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in part ii item 7 

  

   

the size and complexity of the company’s business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation the company is subject to environmental claims income tax matters and other litigation which if not resolved within established accruals could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

   

a substantial portion of the company’s current and retired employee population are covered by pension and postretirement obligation plans the costs of which are dependent upon the company’s estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets discount rates for future payment obligations rates of future cost growth and trend rates for future costs and variances from these estimates could adversely affect the company’s profitability and overall financial position see “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” in part ii item 7 

  

   

the company endeavors to identify and cover through insurance agreements significant risks of loss including without limitation natural disasters business interruption and products liability but there may be disputes with carriers over coverage that may affect timing of cash flows or if the outcome is unfavorable may have an adverse effect on results of operations for example we are in dispute with one of our insurance carriers with regard to hurricane katrina see notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8

various claims and legal proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business relating to the company and its properties based upon the information available the company does not believe that the resolution of any pending proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or an operating division or subdivision suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company because of its reliance on government contracts

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

business 

northrop grumman provides technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in information and services aerospace electronics and shipbuilding as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier northrop grumman participates in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states and abroad northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the united states us government principally the department of defense dod the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 

  

outlook 

us defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years while the current us defense budget forecast shows a slower rate of growth than in prior years and certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in systems integration defense electronics information technology advanced aircraft shipbuilding and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2006 and beyond in 2006 based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 56 billion as of december 31 2005 and its opportunity to win future programs the company expects sales of approximately 31 billion and continued improvements in net income over 2005 expected 2006 sales reflect the impact of the company’s strategic decision to exit the valueadded reseller business reported under information technology as the enterprise information technology business area as well as several small businesses the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

  

industry factors 

while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

  

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services as well as its ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 

  

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts or threats to homeland security and is 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

increasingly more dependent upon proactive threat identification such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement deterrence policing or peacekeeping in addition the dod’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk as a result of these trends both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated systems that provide longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms 

  

while the upward trend in overall defense spending is beginning to slow budgets are expected to continue to exhibit real growth in the coming years defense spending in nato countries however is flat or trending downward those countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities although the quadrennial defense review eliminated a few major procurement programs in the fiscal 2007 budget it did increase the dod focus on intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr joint command and control and other areas for future budget submissions the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain but the 2007 budget submitted by the president of the united states indicates that the defense budget will increase approximately 285 billion or 7 percent over the amount enacted for fiscal 2006 while this budget includes proposed reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expected to compete the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas involving isr and irregular warfare capabilities 

  

us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 

  

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include aerial refueling tanker crew exploratory vehicle longrange bomber space radar transformational communication system restricted programs and several international and homeland security programs the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2006 and beyond 

  

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne surveillance battle management precision weapons systems integration defense electronics and information technology the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr and missile systems the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated 

  

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 

  

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material effect on the company

contracts 

  

the majority of the company’s business is generated from longterm government contracts for development production and service activities government contracts typically include the following negotiated cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of far and cas include but are not limited to certain legal costs marktomarket stock compensation expense lobbying costs charitable donations and advertising costs 

  

the company’s longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

  

cost reimbursement or costtype contracts – costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 

  

fixedprice contracts – a fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment because of costs incurred by the contractor 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the following table summarizes 2005 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

  

   

contract fees 

negotiated contract fee structures for both costtype and fixedprice contracts may include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fee and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentage of completion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

  

positive award fees 

certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical ingenuity award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company’s operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kinetic energy interceptors kei national polarorbiting operational environmental satellite system npoess f35 lpd and ddx programs 

  

compliance and monitoring 

on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

  

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements see in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as part of its oversight responsibilities management evaluates the propriety of its estimates judgments and accounting methods as new events occur management believes that its policies judgments and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company’s financial statements with a fair presentation of information in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management periodically reviews the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 

  

revenue recognition 

  

overview 

the company generally recognizes revenue from its longterm contracts under the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the ships segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of product sales the costs allocable to the delivered units costs allocated to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventoried costs 

  

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of its products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment sales under percentageofcompletion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred or units are delivered revenue relating to service contracts is recognized as the services are performed 

  

cost estimation 

the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the availability of materials the effect of change orders the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims or requests for equitable adjustment included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

  

performance incentives and award fees 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 

  

loss provisions 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded as cost of sales in the period the loss is determined loss provisions are first offset against contract costs that are included in inventories with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

  

other changes in estimates 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations

purchase accounting and goodwill 

  

overview 

the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

  

acquisition accruals 

the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience and consultation with outside valuation specialists 

  

goodwill 

the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually in november or when evidence of potential impairment exists in accordance with sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangibles assets  in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

  

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company’s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model the terminal value growth rate used for testing purposes in 2005 approximates the estimated longterm inflation rate 

  

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview 

in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

its internal and external legal counsel while the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters resolution of one or more of these matters either individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

environmental accruals 

the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated factors which could result in changes to the company’s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology 

  

litigation accruals 

litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

tax contingency accruals 

the company records accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from preacquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

  

retirement benefits 

  

overview 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

  

assumptions 

the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates 

  

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical longterm bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each benefit plan taking into consideration the factors noted above the company’s composite discount rate was unchanged at 575 percent for december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations for 2005 the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent for 2006 the expected longterm rate of return assumption is also 85 percent 

  

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2005 pension results

differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2005 postretirement benefit results 

  

   

management financial measures 

  

the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures 

  

contract acquisitions – contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and followon orders in the year that a business is purchased its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions in the year that a business is sold its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from contract acquisitions 

  

sales – yeartoyear sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts for further information see discussion concerning revenue recognition included in the “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” section of this part ii item 7 

  

segment operating margin – segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration legal environmental certain compensation and retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the federal acquisition regulation and therefore not allocated to the segments

backlog – funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders 

  

consolidated operating results 

  

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

  

   

sales and service revenues 

2005 – sales in 2005 increased 868 million or 3 percent over 2004 due to higher revenue in each of the company’s operating segments except ships including doubledigit sales growth of 18 percent at integrated systems the revenue growth at integrated systems was due primarily to increases of 33 percent and 15 percent in the airborne early warning  electronic warfare systems and integrated systems western region business areas respectively ships segment sales decreased 7 percent in 2005 due primarily to a 30 percent sales decline in the surface combatants business area from changes in the customer’s ddx acquisition strategy and the impact of hurricane katrina see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

  

2004 – sales in 2004 increased approximately 35 billion or 13 percent over 2003 due to higher revenue in each of the company’s business segments including sales growth of 23 percent at integrated systems 19 percent at mission systems 16 percent at space technology and 15 percent at ships the revenue growth at integrated systems was due primarily to increases of 51 percent and 16 percent in the airborne early warningelectronic warfare systems and integrated systems western region business areas respectively the mission systems increase was driven by a 24 percent increase in the command control and intelligence systems business area and a 19 percent increase in the missile systems business area the increase in space technology revenues was led by increases of 41 percent 22 percent and 18 percent in its software defined radios civil space and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance business areas respectively revenue growth at ships was due primarily to increases of 34 percent in the amphibious and auxiliary business area 26 percent in the surface combatants business area and 16 percent in the submarines business area

operating margin 

operating margin represents segment operating margin discussed elsewhere below in the section entitled “segment operating results” adjusted for a number of factors that do not affect the segments as follows 

  

   

unallocated expenses – unallocated expenses decreased 92 million or 33 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 the decrease in unallocated expenses is primarily due to lower legal costs in the 2005 period unallocated expenses increased 145 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 the increase was due primarily to increased legal costs including provisions related to the resolution of the allison gas turbine and robinson litigations as well as higher marktomarket stock compensation expense and deferred state income taxes 

  

net pension expense adjustment – the net pension expense adjustment reflects the excess pension expense determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america over the pension expense included in the segments’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under cas the net pension expense adjustment increased to 21 million in 2005 as compared with 12 million in 2004 the increase reflects changes in actuarial assumptions partially offset by actual 2004 asset returns of greater than 13 percent which improved the funded status of the company’s pension plans in 2004 the net pension expense adjustment decreased 291 million as compared with 2003 the decrease is primarily due to a higher return of more than 20 percent on plan assets in 2003 partially offset by lower 2004 assumptions for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

  

for 2006 subject to refinements for participant census data and payasyougo plans management expects the net pension expense adjustment to total approximately 25 million the 2006 pension plan assumptions have remained unchanged from the 2005 assumptions and include an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 850 percent and a composite discount rate of 575 percent 

  

reversal of royalty income – royalty income is included in segment operating margin for internal reporting purposes this amount is reversed in the table above to arrive at operating margin as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america royalty income is included in the “other net” line item discussed below 

  

interest income 

2005 – interest income in 2005 is comparable to 2004 while 2005 did not have the noncash interest income from the auto paymentinkind note the higher average cash balance on hand during the year and higher interest rates as compared to 2004 generated a comparable amount of interest income 

  

2004 – interest income in 2004 is comparable to 2003 interest income for both years primarily included noncash interest earned on the paymentinkind note received in connection with the sale of auto on october 10 2004 the company reached an agreement with trw automotive holdings corp regarding the repurchase of the paymentinkind note at which time accrual of interest income from the note ceased 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

interest expense 

2005 – interest expense decreased by 43 million or 10 percent in 2005 as compared with 2004 the decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in 2005 resulting from a 600 million reduction in debt in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

2004 – interest expense decreased by 66 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 the decrease is principally due to the effect of the company’s debt reduction plan that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003 also on october 15 2004 350 million of 8625 notes matured and the company redeemed all of its outstanding 250 million 9375 debentures due in 2024 the decrease in interest expense related to the reduction of fixedrate debt was partially offset by dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock classified as interest expense beginning in the third quarter of 2003 

  

other net 

2005 – other net increased 218 million compared with 2004 during 2005 the company sold 725 million trw automotive shares and approximately 35 million endwave shares which generated pretax gains of 70 million and 95 million respectively 

  

2004 – other net decreased 42 million compared with 2003 during 2004 the company recorded a 15 million foreign currency exchange loss on the liquidation of a subsidiary loan and a 13 million expense related to the early retirement of the 250 million 9375 debentures due 2024 

  

federal and foreign income taxes 

2005 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2005 and 2004 was 32 percent during 2005 the company recognized a 20 million net tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of internal revenue service irs appeals cases related to alternative minimum tax credits for tax years 1981 through 1996 the effective tax rate for 2006 is expected to be approximately 33 percent 

  

2004 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 28 percent for 2003 the higher rate in 2004 is primarily due to the reduced effect of research and development credits as well as increased foreign earnings that have a higher effective rate during 2004 the company completed studies and recognized additional tax credits of approximately 31 million related to research and development and extraterritorial income exclusion for the years 1997 through 2003 during 2003 the company recognized 51 million in research and development tax credits for the years 1981 through 1990 

  

discontinued operations 

2005 – there was no income from discontinued operations in 2005 compared to aftertax income of 3 million in 2004 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of 17 million in 2005 is primarily due to the divestiture of teldix 

  

2004 – the company reported aftertax income from discontinued operations of 3 million for 2004 compared to aftertax income of 64 million for the same period of 2003 the income for the 2003 period was primarily attributable to auto operating results which were included in discontinued operations until auto was sold in february 2003 the loss from the disposal of discontinued operations of 12 million in 2004 was primarily due to the resolution of indemnities and other contractual issues from previously disposed entities 

  

diluted earnings per share 

2005 – diluted earnings per share for 2005 was 385 per share an increase of 30 percent from 297 per share in 2004 earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 3632 million for 2005 and 3650 million for 2004

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company on a sitebysite basis such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable

2004 results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

  

   

sales and service revenues 

sales in 2004 increased approximately 35 billion or 13 percent over 2003 due to higher revenue in each of the company’s business segments including sales growth of 23 percent at integrated systems 19 percent at mission systems 16 percent at space technology and 15 percent at ships the revenue growth at integrated systems was due primarily to increases of 51 percent and 16 percent in the airborne early warningelectronic warfare systems and air combat systems business areas respectively the mission systems increase was driven by a 24 percent increase in the command control and intelligence systems business area and a 19 percent increase in the missile systems business area the increase in space technology revenues was led by increases of 41 percent 22 percent and 18 percent in its software defined radios civil space and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance business areas respectively revenue growth at ships was due primarily to increases of 34 percent in the amphibious and auxiliary business area 26 percent in the surface combatants business area and 16 percent in the submarines business area 

  

operating margin 

operating margin for 2004 increased 538 million or 37 percent as compared with 2003 reflecting a 389 million increase in operating performance from the segments and a decrease of 218 million in pension expense which were partially offset by 145 million in higher unallocated expenses 

  

the 2004 operating margin includes a pretax charge of 60 million for increased projected costs for the f16 block 60 fixedprice development program and a pretax charge of 52 million for increased projected costs for the multirole electronically scanned array mesa radar system for the australian defence force’s project wedgetail fixedprice development program both reported in the electronic systems segment operating margin for 2003 included a pretax charge of 69 million for the commercial polar tanker program reported in the ships segment a pretax charge of 40 million for the f16 block 60 fixedprice development program reported in the electronic systems segment and a pretax charge of 31 million for the adjustment to fair market value of the remaining component technologies ct businesses reclassified to continuing operations 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

operating margin for 2004 includes pension expense recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america totaling 350 million a decrease of 38 percent from 2003 primarily due to improved 2003 asset returns partially offset by a lower discount rate and a lower than expected longterm rate of return on plan assets pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to us government cost accounting standards cas increased operating margin by 338 million in 2004 and 265 million in 2003 

  

the increase in unallocated expenses is primarily due to higher legal costs which include 2004 provisions related to the resolution of the allison gas turbine and robinson litigation see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 as well as higher marktomarket stock compensation expense and deferred state income taxes 

  

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations for 2004 increased 335 million or 44 percent as compared with 2003 this increase reflects improved operating margin performance and 66 million in lower interest expense due to a reduction in fixedrate debt as a result of the company’s debt restructuring plan which was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2003 these increases were partially offset by several onetime charges in 2004 recorded in other net including a 15 million foreign currency exchange loss on the liquidation of a subsidiary loan a 13 million expense related to the early retirement of 250 million 9375 percent debentures due 2024 and a 9 million loss on the sale of the paymentinkind note receivable from trw automotive holdings corp 

  

the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 28 percent for 2003 the higher rate in 2004 is primarily due to the reduced effect of research and development tax credits the company recognized research and development tax credits of 20 million and 51 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

net income 

net income for 2004 increased 218 million or 25 percent as compared with 2003 which included a 117 million decrease from discontinued operations the results of discontinued operations for 2003 included the january and february operating results of trw’s automotive business auto which was sold in february 2003 the loss on disposal of discontinued operations in 2004 was primarily due to the resolution of indemnities and other contractual issues resulting from previously disposed entities the gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2003 resulted from sales of certain ct businesses during the year 

  

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share for 2004 was 297 per share an increase of 28 percent from 232 per share in 2003 earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 3650 million for 2004 and 3684 million for 2003 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased 11 billion as compared with 2003 net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 includes contributions to the company’s pension plans totaling 623 million of which 250 million was voluntarily prefunded in the fourth quarter as compared to contributions of 329 million in 2003 net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 includes a 1 billion tax payment related to the completion of the b2 engineering and manufacturing development emd contract 

  

outlook 

united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years while the current defense budget forecast shows a slower rate of growth than in prior years and certain 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in systems integration defense electronics information technology advanced aircraft shipbuilding and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2005 and beyond in 2005 based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately 58 billion as of december 31 2004 and its opportunity to win future programs the company expects sales to range between 31 billion and 315 billion and continued improvements in net income and net cash provided by operating activities over 2004 the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

  

industry factors 

while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix northrop grumman along with lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin the boeing company boeing raytheon company raytheon and general dynamics corporation general dynamics are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract turn out to be a subcontractor it is not uncommon to compete with a peer company and simultaneously on other contracts to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in many industries 

  

the company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products as well as its ability to provide the people facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations northrop grumman’s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives 

  

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts or threats to homeland security and is increasingly more dependent upon proactive threat identification such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement deterrence policing or peacekeeping in addition the dod’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk as a result of these trends both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms 

  

united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years defense spending in nato countries has stabilized while those countries continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain the 2006 budget submitted by the president of the united states indicates that the defense budget will increase approximately 83 billion or 20 percent over the next five years while this budget includes proposed reductions for certain programs in which the company 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

participates for example cvn21 ddx kinetic energy interceptors and virginiaclass submarines the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and national missile defense 

  

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include spacebased radar transformational communication system and several international and homeland security programs the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2005 and beyond 

  

us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 

  

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne surveillance battle management precision weapons systems integration defense electronics and information technology through its acquisitions of litton industries inc litton newport news shipbuilding inc newport news and trw inc trw the company now has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines space technology command control  intelligence c2i and missile systems the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated 

  

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 

  

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

businesses acquired 

  

the current composition of northrop grumman corporation is the result of a series of strategic acquisitions mergers and divestitures 

  

litton and newport news – in 2001 the company purchased litton the electronics and information systems group of aerojetgeneral corporation eis and 807 percent of newport news on january 18 2002 the company acquired the remaining shares of newport news 

  

trw – in december 2002 the company purchased 100 percent of the common stock of trw valued at approximately 125 billion including the assumption of trw’s debt of 48 billion the company issued approximately 139 million shares of its common stock with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share of the company’s stock which otherwise would be issued to the trw shareholders 

  

the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2002 reflect preliminary estimates of the fair market value for purchased intangibles retiree benefits assets and liabilities and debt as well as preliminary estimates of adjustments necessary to conform trw to the company’s accounting policies auto was included in the total trw valuation and was valued and recorded at its sale price which represents its fair market value as of december 31 2003 the company completed the fair market value and accounting conformance evaluation process for trw and recorded an aggregate increase to goodwill of 16 billion 

  

businesses sold and discontinued operations 

  

trw auto – on february 28 2003 the company sold auto to the blackstone group for 33 billion in cash a 600 million face value paymentinkind note initially valued at 455 million and a 196 percent interest in the new enterprise initially valued at 170 million the acquirer also assumed debt of approximately 200 million the cash received from the sale of auto was adjusted from the sale agreement amount by cash sold with the business purchase price adjustments and an asset retained cash proceeds from the sale were primarily used to reduce debt in january 2004 the restrictions on the investment in auto were amended to provide the company more flexibility in monetization in february 2004 the company’s investment in auto was diluted to 172 percent as a result of auto’s initial public offering 

  

on october 10 2004 the company reached an agreement with trw automotive holdings corp to sell the paymentinkind note and settle certain other contractual issues arising from the auto sale at the date of the agreement the note including accrued interest had a carrying value of 543 million the company also resolved 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

an indemnification of other postretirement employee benefits pursuant to the auto sale agreement and agreed to pay the blackstone group 525 million as a result of the agreement the company recorded a 9 million aftertax charge to continuing operations relating to the sale of the note and a 6 million aftertax charge to discontinued operations related to the settlement of the indemnification and other contractual issues in november 2004 the company received 4935 million for the sale of the note which was net of 405 million for settlement of the contractual issues and paid 525 million for settlement of the indemnification 

  

goodrich – the company assumed through its acquisition of trw certain postclosing liabilities retained by trw in connection with trw’s october 2002 sale of its aeronautical systems business to goodrich corporation goodrich the company and goodrich agreed to a settlement to resolve certain postclosing liabilities related to warranty customer claims and certain other matters in exchange for a payment to goodrich of 99 million this settlement resulted in a fourth quarter 2004 aftertax charge to discontinued operations of 15 million the settlement excludes amounts associated with claims that goodrich may assert against the company relating to the airbus a380 actuation systems development program and certain other liabilities retained by trw under the original acquisition agreement 

  

discontinued operations – during the third quarter of 2002 the company concluded that the ct businesses which were acquired as part of the litton acquisition did not fit with the company’s longterm plans and decided to sell these businesses accordingly the businesses comprising the ct segment were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2002 the company sold three of the ct businesses in 2003 and a fourth ct business in 2004 none of these sales either individually or in the aggregate had a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations the three remaining ct businesses consist of a manufacturer of complex printed circuit boards an electronic connector manufacturer and a europeanbased marketing group during the third quarter of 2004 the company suspended its efforts to sell these businesses accordingly the assets liabilities and results of operations of these businesses have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for all periods presented these businesses are reported under the segment entitled “other” 

  

northrop grumman canada – on december 30 2004 the company completed the sale of its canadian navigation systems and space sensors systems businesses for 65 million in cash and recorded a 9 million aftertax gain in discontinued operations the assets and liabilities as well as the results of operations of the canadian navigation systems and space sensors systems businesses were not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

contracts 

  

the majority of the company’s business is generated from longterm government contracts for development production and service activities government contracts typically include the following negotiated cost direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the federal acquisition regulations far and government cas as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government based on the far and cas unallowable clauses include but are not limited to certain legal costs marktomarket stock compensation expense lobbying costs charitable donations and advertising costs 

  

the company’s longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

  

cost reimbursement or costtype contracts – costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 

  

fixedprice contracts – a fixedprice contract is a contract in which the price is a predetermined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment because of costs incurred by the contractor 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the following table summarizes 2004 revenue recognized by contract type and customer 

  

   

contract fees 

negotiated contract fee structures for both costtype and fixedprice contracts may include but are not limited to fixedfee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance positive award fee and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentage of completion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

  

contract risk 

due to their nature fixedprice contracts inherently have more risk than costtype contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins costtype contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees and negative performance incentives the more significant risk factors relating to the company’s contracts are fixedprice development contracts and negative performance incentive provisions included in certain costtype and fixedprice contracts 

  

fixedprice development contracts – fixedprice development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the development stage as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced in addition successful performance of fixedprice development contracts which include production units is subject to the company’s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixedprice development programs future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates examples of the company’s significant fixedprice development contracts include the f16 block 60 combat avionics program and the mesa radar system for the australian defence force’s project wedgetail program both of which are performed by the electronic systems segment it is also not unusual in the ships segment for the company to negotiate fixedprice production followon contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing contracts examples of negotiated fixedprice followon production options or contracts are the polar tanker program and the virginiaclass submarine program 

  

positive award fees – certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fee amounts based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical ingenuity award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance against such negotiated criteria award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company’s operating segments examples of significant longterm contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei npoess f35 lpd and ddx programs 

  

negative performance incentive provisions – certain contracts primarily involving space satellite systems contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for a specified period of time under such terms the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized andor collected the company has not experienced any significant losses in the last decade in connection with contract performance incentive provisions however if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future such events could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

compliance and monitoring 

on a regular basis the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 

  

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements see part ii item 8 of this form 10k the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management is responsible for evaluating the propriety of its estimates judgments and accounting methods as new events occur management believes that its policies estimates and judgments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company’s financial statements with a fair presentation of information in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management periodically reviews the company’s critical accounting policies estimates and judgments with the audit committee of its board of directors principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 

  

revenue recognition 

  

overview 

the company generally recognizes revenue from its longterm contracts under the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material primarily in the ships segment sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs the unitsofdelivery measure is a modification of the percentageofcompletion method which recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of product sales the costs allocable to the delivered units costs allocated to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventoried costs 

  

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of its products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment sales under costtype contracts are recorded as costs are incurred revenue relating to service contracts is recognized as the services are performed 

  

application of accounting principles 

the majority of the company’s contracts are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 45 – accounting for longterm constructiontype contracts american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 811 – accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contract  the aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors and aicpa sop no 972 – software revenue recognition  as amended by sop 989  these pronouncements apply to contracts for the construction of facilities production of goods and services provided to the federal government and arrangements to deliver software or software systems requiring significant production modification or customization 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

cost estimation 

the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

  

performance incentives and award fees 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

  

loss provisions 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 

  

other changes in estimates 

other changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

additional details concerning the company’s revenue recognition policy are in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

  

purchase accounting and goodwill 

  

overview 

the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 

  

acquisition accruals 

the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience and consultation with outside experts 

  

goodwill 

the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists in accordance with sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangibles assets  in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 

  

the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company’s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry the terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model the terminal value growth rate used for testing purposes in 2004 approximates the estimated longterm inflation rate 

  

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company’s impairment analysis differences in assumptions within a range considered by management to be reasonable applied to the 2004 annual goodwill impairment tests would not have resulted in a significant adjustment to recorded goodwill 

  

litigation and contingencies 

  

overview 

in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

  

environmental accruals 

the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts or conducted operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated factors which could result in changes to the company’s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

tax contingency accruals 

the company records accruals for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from preacquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill other adjustments to tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

  

retirement benefits 

  

overview 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

  

assumptions 

the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates 

  

discount rate – the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical longterm bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments taking into consideration the factors noted above the company lowered the discount rate to 575 percent at december 31 2004 from 625 percent at december 31 2003 

  

expected longterm rate of return – the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments for 2004 the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 875 percent on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm has exceeded 875 percent however for 2005 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was lowered from 875 percent to 85 percent reflecting the generally expected moderation of longterm rates of return in the financial markets 

  

differences in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2004 pension and postretirement benefit results 

  

   

health care cost trend rates – the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants the company increased its expected health care cost trend rate to 10 percent for 2004 from 9 percent for 2003 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

differences in the health care cost trend rates within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2004 postretirement benefit results 

  

   

management financial measures 

  

the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures 

  

contract acquisitions – contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and followon orders in the year that a business is purchased its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions 

  

sales – yeartoyear sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts for further information related to revenue recognition refer to the revenue recognition discussion included in the “critical accounting policies estimates and judgments” section of this part ii item 7 

  

segment operating margin – segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of pension expenseincome that is not currently recognized under cas as well as the portion of corporate legal environmental state income tax other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable costs under cas and therefore not allocated to the segments 

  

backlog – funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders 

  

segment operating results 

  

realignment – effective january 1 2004 the company realigned businesses among three of its operating segments that possess similar customers expertise and capabilities the realignment more fully leverages existing capabilities and enhances development and delivery of highly integrated information systems and services mission systems’ global information technology civil systems and mission systems europe businesses were transferred to the information technology segment prior to january 1 2004 the three business areas comprised mission systems’ federal  civil information systems business the defense mission systems dms business within the information technology segment was transferred to the mission systems segment prior to january 1 2004 dms was a part of information technology’s government information technology business the command control  intelligence c2i systems business area of the missions systems segment transferred its unmanned air vehicle business to the air combat systems acs business area within the integrated systems segment this realignment resulted in a decrease in 2003 sales of 104 million for the information technology sector an increase of 57 million for the mission systems sector and an increase of 47 million for the integrated systems sector for 2002 this realignment resulted in a decrease in sales of 764 million for the information technology sector and an increase of 764 million for the mission systems sector

sales and service revenues 

2004 – electronic systems segment sales increased 378 million or 6 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 government systems revenue increased 224 million or 50 percent due to higher sales of biodetection systems and postal automation equipment and defensive systems revenue rose 141 million or 15 percent due to higher sales from the litening program defense other revenue increased 66 million or 14 percent due to growth in restricted programs 

  

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

for 2005 management expects high singledigit percentage sales growth over 2004 

  

2003 – electronic systems segment sales increased 713 million or 13 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 aerospace systems revenue increased 184 million or 13 percent due to increased volume on the f35 f16 block 60 fa22 and avionics restricted programs defensive systems sales increased 136 million or 17 percent in 2003 over 2002 primarily due to higher volume on the alq135 large aircraft infrared countermeasures mh53 and litening programs the 2003 increase of 163 million in the defense other business area was primarily due to higher volume on the mprtip program 

  

segment operating margin 

2004 – electronic systems segment operating margin increased 80 million or 14 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 operating margin in 2004 increased primarily due to increased sales volume and performance improvements in the postal automation business and biodetection systems in the government systems business area as well as higher sales volume improved performance and contract closeouts in the defensive systems and defense other business areas these increases were partially offset by a 60 million pretax charge in the aerospace systems business area for the f16 block 60 fixedprice development combat avionics program reflecting a higher estimate of costs to complete the “falcon edge” electronic warfare suite including the results of qualification testing and the impact of delays in supplies of integrated microelectronic assemblies and a 52 million pretax charge reflecting increased projected costs due to analysis of technical issues following systems engineering modeling and qualification testing for the mesa radar system for the australian defence force’s project wedgetail fixedprice development program fixedprice development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the work as work progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced while management has used its best judgment to estimate costs future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates the f16 block 60 program is expected to be completed in 2007 and the wedgetail program is expected to be completed in 2008 

  

for 2005 management expects moderate improvement in segment operating margin as a percentage of segment sales over 2004 

  

2003 – electronic systems segment operating margin increased 156 million or 36 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 the increase in operating margin in 2003 was primarily due to increased sales volume in aerospace systems’ fa22 f35 and several restricted programs as well as increased volume in the c4isr  naval systems marine systems business the defensive systems and navigation systems business areas also reported higher sales and improved operating performance operating margin for 2003 included a 40 million pretax charge for the f16 block 60 fixedprice development combat avionics program due to cost growth associated with developing and acquiring the advanced microelectronics necessary to meet production specifications and delivery rates

ships 

  

   

contract acquisitions 

2004 – ships segment acquisitions increased 829 million or 17 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 primarily due to increased funding in the aircraft carriers and submarines business areas the principal acquisitions in 2004 were 11 billion for the virginiaclass submarines program in the submarines business area and 1 billion and 524 million for the ddx and ddg programs respectively in the surface combatants business area acquisitions in 2004 also included 583 million and 397 million respectively for the lpd and lhd programs in the amphibious and auxiliary business area 

  

2003 – ships segment acquisitions decreased 447 million or 8 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily due to lower incremental funding received in 2003 for aircraft carrier refueling work the principal acquisitions in 2003 were 12 billion for the lpd program in the amphibious and auxiliary business area and 877 million and 531 million related to the ddx and ddg programs respectively in the surface combatants business area 

  

sales and service revenues 

2004 – ships segment sales increased 801 million or 15 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to higher revenue in the surface combatants amphibious and auxiliary and submarines business areas surface combatants revenue increased 416 million or 26 percent due to higher revenue from the ddx and deepwater programs partially offset by lower revenue from the ddg program amphibious and auxiliary revenue increased 367 million or 34 percent due to higher revenue from the lhd and lpd programs and submarines revenue increased 103 million or 16 percent due to higher sales from the virginiaclass program 

  

for 2005 management expects a mid to high singledigit percentage sales decline as compared to 2004 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2003 – ships segment sales increased 754 million or 16 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 this growth included a 719 million increase for the surface combatants business area which was primarily due to increased sales for the ddx and deepwater programs amphibious and auxiliary experienced an increase in sales during 2003 of 224 million due to production rampup on the lpd 18 lpd 19 and lhd 8 programs the 154 million decrease in 2003 for aircraft carriers as compared to 2002 was largely due to the completion and delivery of the uss ronald reagan  

  

segment operating margin 

2004 – ships segment operating margin increased 94 million or 32 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to a 2003 pretax charge of 69 million for increased costs for the commercial polar tanker program as well as increased sales volume and performance improvements in 2004 for the ddx and lhd programs in the surface combatants and amphibious and auxiliary business areas respectively the polar tanker charge included cost growth on the third tanker due to unusual weather delays and rework and increased costs for changes in labor productivity estimates to complete the final two ships the third tanker was delivered in the third quarter of 2003 the fourth tanker was delivered in the third quarter of 2004 and the fifth and final tanker is approximately 80 percent complete as of december 31 2004 and is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

for 2005 management expects segment operating margin as a percentage of segment sales to be in the low 7 percent range 

  

2003 – ships segment operating margin decreased 11 million or 4 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 the decrease included both a changing mix from production to development programs as well as the 69 million pretax charge for the polar tanker program discussed above 

  

information technology 

  

   

contract acquisitions 

2004 – information technology segment acquisitions increased 446 million or 9 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 largely due to increased funding in the government information technology and commercial information technology business areas principal acquisitions in 2004 in the government information technology business area were 138 million for the national geospatial intelligence agency electrical

for 2005 management expects segment operating margin as a percentage of segment sales to be in the low 7 percent range 

  

2003 – operating margin for the space technology segment in 2003 was 193 million or 7 percent driven by strong margin performance in the software defined radios and intelligence surveillance  reconnaissance business areas and increased sales volume in all business areas 

  

nonsegment factors affecting operating margin 

  

the company’s operations substantially changed as a result of the trw acquisition on december 11 2002 the company’s 2002 income statement does not include trw’s postacquisition results because they were not material the 2002 results reflect the first full year of operations of litton eis and newport news which were acquired in 2001 these acquisitions have significantly increased the size of the company and produced one of the largest defense contractors in the nation 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

the components of operating margin are as follows 

  

   

operating margin as a percentage of total revenue was 67 percent 56 percent and 64 percent for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the primary factors affecting operating margin during these periods were the business acquisitions operating segment performance and changes in unallocated expenses and pension amounts 

  

unallocated expenses 

2004 – unallocated expenses increased 145 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 the increase was due primarily to increased legal costs including provisions related to the resolution of the allison gas turbine and robinson litigation see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 as well as higher marktomarket stock compensation expense and deferred state income taxes 

  

2003 – unallocated expenses increased 32 million in 2003 net of a 17 million gain on the settlement of legal matters as compared with 2002 the increase was due primarily to higher legal costs and increased estimates of unrecoverable costs in 2003 the company settled two previously reserved civil false claims act cases us v newport news shipbuilding inc and us ex rel jordan and recorded loss provisions for settlement offers on other legal matters resulting in a net gain of 17 million the two settled cases required payments by the company of approximately 80 million 

  

the 60 million settlement amount allocated by the plaintiff to the newport news shipbuilding case was charged to an existing accrual established for the government’s claim that newport news had improperly charged certain independent research and development costs to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through 1999 the government filed a civil false claims act case against the company in february 2003 seeking single damages in excess of 72 million plus penalties costs and interest the company accrued an amount for this matter determined in accordance with sfas no 5 – accounting for contingencies  after considering the facts and circumstances known to management at the time including the potential for treble damages and penalties as provided in the false claims act the accrual when established had no effect on the company’s net income as it was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as part of the purchase accounting for newport news which was acquired in december 2001 the unused portion of the accrual of approximately 120 million was reversed and together with the loss provisions recorded for other legal matters is included in the 17 million net gain reported in “unallocated expenses” 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

pension expense income 

2004 – pension expense decreased 218 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 the decrease is primarily due to a higher return of more than 20 percent on plan assets in 2003 which improved the funded status of the company’s pension plans partially offset by lower 2004 assumptions for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

  

pension expense is included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under cas in order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total operating margin these amounts are reported under the caption “reversal of cas pension expense included above” 

  

for 2005 subject to refinements for participant census data and payasyougo plans management expects pension expense determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to total approximately 415 million pension expense recognized under cas which is generally recoverable under government contracts is estimated to be 365 million for 2005 based on expected longterm returns available in the capital markets and lower longterm interest rates the 2005 pension plan assumptions have been changed from the 2004 assumptions the 2005 assumptions include an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent and a discount rate of 575 percent compared with the 2004 assumptions of 875 percent and 625 percent respectively 

  

2003 – operating margin in 2003 included pension expense of 568 million as compared with pension income in 2002 of 90 million the increased pension expense was primarily due to a higher number of plan participants resulting from the acquisition of trw as well as a negative return on plan assets of 10 percent in 2002 

  

beginning in july 2003 the pension benefits for most employees principally those participating in northrop grumman and litton heritage plans were based upon new criteria whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period subsequent to the 2003 initial phasein other exempt and nonexempt plans have been and continue to be conformed to the new model no settlement or curtailments arose as a result of these changes union plans were not affected by these plan modifications 

  

other income statement components 

  

interest income 

2004 – interest income in 2004 is comparable to 2003 interest income for both years primarily included noncash interest earned on the paymentinkind note received in connection with the sale of auto on october 10 2004 the company reached an agreement with trw automotive holdings corp regarding the repurchase of the paymentinkind note at which time accrual of interest income from the note ceased 

  

2003 – interest income increased 49 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 the increase is primarily due to noncash interest earned on the paymentinkind note received in connection with the sale of auto interest earned on a tax refund and interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash 

  

interest expense 

2004 – interest expense decreased by 66 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 the decrease is principally due to the effect of the company’s debt reduction plan that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003 also on october 15 2004 350 million of 8625 percent notes matured and the company redeemed all of its outstanding 250 million 9375 percent debentures due in 2024 the decrease in interest expense related to the reduction of fixedrate debt was partially offset by dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock classified as interest expense beginning in the third quarter of 2003 this classification was required on a prospective basis upon the adoption of sfas no 150 – accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

2003 – interest expense increased by 75 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 the increase was principally the result of higher debt levels arising from the acquisition of trw net of the effect of the company’s debt reduction plan which was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003 

  

income taxes 

2004 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 28 percent for 2003 the higher rate in 2004 is primarily due to the reduced effect of research and development tax credits the company recognized research and development tax credits of 20 million and 51 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the effective tax rate for 2005 is expected to be between 33 and 34 percent 

  

2003 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2003 was 28 percent compared to 38 percent during 2002 the lower rate in 2003 was primarily due to higher research tax credits 

  

discontinued operations 

2004 – the company reported aftertax income from discontinued operations of 3 million for 2004 compared to aftertax income of 64 million for the same period of 2003 the income for the 2003 period was primarily attributable to auto operating results which were included in discontinued operations until auto was sold in february 2003 

  

the businesses comprising the ct reporting segment were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2002 and subsequently the company has sold all but three of these businesses the remaining unsold businesses are a manufacturer of complex printed circuit boards and assemblies an electronic connector manufacturer and a europeanbased marketing group during the third quarter of 2004 the company suspended its efforts to sell these remaining businesses and they were reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations the operating results of these businesses are reported under the segment entitled “other” 

  

as a result of the reclassification sales for 2003 increased 191 million and income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2003 decreased 50 million income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2003 includes a charge of 31 million for the adjustment to fair market value of the remaining ct businesses reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations the reclassification decreased 2003 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to 203 from 216 

  

effective january 1 2005 two of these operations were integrated into and reported under the electronic systems segment the europeanbased marketing group will continue to be reported under “other” the effect of this realignment on the electronic systems segment’s sales and operating margin is not significant 

  

2003 – the company reported aftertax income from discontinued operations of 64 million net of a goodwill impairment charge of 47 million during 2003 the 44 million aftertax gain from disposal of discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the sale of two ct businesses the gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations includes any gain or loss from completed dispositions as well as the estimated loss from those businesses expected to be sold at a loss where the sale had not yet been completed gains realized on the sale of any discontinued businesses are reported in the period in which the divestiture is complete 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change 

effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets which implemented required disclosure provisions and eliminated the amortization of goodwill during the second quarter of 2002 the company completed the first step of the required initial test for potential impairment of 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

goodwill as of january 1 2002 the company used a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate to determine the fair value of its reporting units the results indicated potential impairment only in the reporting units of the ct segment due to unfavorable market conditions during the third quarter of 2002 the company completed the measurement of the ct goodwill impairment as of january 1 2002 and recorded a noncash aftertax charge of 432 million or 187 per diluted share which is reported as “cumulative effect of accounting change”

northrop grumman corporation 

los angeles california 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that northrop grumman corporation and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of the company and our report dated march 1 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

environmental matters 

federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment affect the company’s manufacturing operations the company has provided for the estimated cost to complete remediation where the company has determined that it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental impact at current or formerly owned operating facilities or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or similarly designated by other environmental agencies it 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the status of the law regulations and their interpretations 

  

in order to assess the potential impact on the company’s financial statements management estimates the possible remediation costs that reasonably could be incurred by the company such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of the company’s environmental engineers and when necessary consultation with outside environmental specialists in most instances only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated however in the determination of accruals the most probable amount is used when determinable and the minimum is used when no single amount is more probable the company records accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and the costs can be reasonably estimated the company does not anticipate and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable 

  

management estimates that at december 31 2003 the range of reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation is 251 million to 366 million of which 271 million has been accrued including 25 million recorded in liabilities of businesses held for sale environmental reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties the company provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities in addition should other prp’s not pay their allocable share of remediation costs the company may have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and accrued management does not believe that it will be required to assume a share of the liability of other prp’s in an amount that would have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations the company makes the investments it believes will be necessary in order to comply with environmental laws

overview 

  

northrop grumman provides technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in defense and commercial electronics nuclear and nonnuclear shipbuilding information technology mission systems systems integration and space technology as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier northrop grumman participates in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states and abroad northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government principally the department of defense dod the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 

  

2003 results 

the 2003 financial statements include trw inc trw which was acquired on december 11 2002 this acquisition had a significant effect on the company’s operations and is an important factor to be considered in comparing 2003 results with 2002 results selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

  

   

sales increased in 2003 over 2002 by 9 billion or 52 percent due to the 67 billion of sales contributed by the newly acquired trw business segments space technology and mission systems and the 23 billion or 13 percent growth in the company’s heritage segments electronic systems ships information technology and integrated systems operating margin for 2003 increased by 147 million or 11 percent over 2002 reflecting 451 million from the new segments and an increase of 225 million or 17 percent from the heritage segments offset by increased pension cost total operating margin in 2003 includes pension expense of 568 million compared with pension income of 90 million in 2002 cost accounting standards cas pension expense increased to 265 million in 2003 from 100 million for 2002 

  

net income for 2002 included a 432 million charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change on january 1 2002 to recognize the impairment of goodwill in the company’s component technologies reporting units and an additional goodwill impairment loss of 186 million reported in loss from discontinued operations 

  

earnings per share are based on weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 1842 million for 2003 and 1174 million for 2002 the significant increase in shares outstanding is primarily the result of the acquisition of trw in exchange for stock 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 891 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002 in 2003 cash provided by operating activities was reduced by approximately 1 billion for taxes paid related to the completion of the b2 engineering and manufacturing development emd contract

outlook 

through sixteen acquisitions over the past decade the company has evolved from an aircraft manufacturer into a global enterprise focused on providing a broad range of products and services needed to meet the nation’s defense and homeland security challenges the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in systems integration defense electronics information technology advanced aircraft shipbuilding and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2004 and beyond in 2004 based on its current total backlog funded and unfunded of 58 billion and its opportunity to win future programs the company expects revenue of approximately 28 billion and improvements in net income and cash provided by operations over 2003 the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company’s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 

  

industry factors 

while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix lockheed martin corporation the boeing company raytheon company and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract turn out to be a subcontractor it is not uncommon to compete with a peer company and simultaneously on other contracts to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in many industries 

  

an individual company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products as well as its ability to provide the people facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations northrop grumman’s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives 

  

economic opportunities challenges and risks 

the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts homeland security and proactive threat identification such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement deterrence policing or peacekeeping in addition the dod’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk as a result of these trends both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years defense spending in nato countries has stabilized while those countries continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain current indications are that the defense budget will increase over the next five years looking forward based on the 2004 budget submitted by the president of the united states the company continues to plan for steady sustainable growth in national security spending the future year defense program fydp shows an increase to the dod investment accounts of about 3 percent for 2005 with doubledigit increases in areas like missile defense the remainder of the fydp shows approximately 6 percent annual growth through 2009 the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of our homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority with particular emphasis on areas like national missile defense 

  

substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include space based radar aerial common sensor transformational communication system the joint unmanned combat air system jucas and several international and homeland security programs the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2004 and beyond 

  

us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 

  

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne surveillance battle management precision weapons systems integration defense electronics and information technology through its acquisitions of litton industries inc litton newport news shipbuilding inc newport news and trw the company now has a significant presence in space technology command control  intelligence c2i federal and civil information systems missile systems and the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated 

  

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 

  

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s future

management financial measures 

  

the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through measures of acquisitions sales segment operating margin and backlog 

  

acquisitions – contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and followon orders in the year that a business is purchased its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions 

  

sales – yeartoyear sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 

  

segment operating margin – segment operating margin reflects the performance of the segments on their contracts and programs excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the portion of pension expenseincome that is not currently recognized under cas as well as the portion of corporate legal environmental state income tax other retiree benefits and other expenses not considered allowable costs under cas and not allocated to the segments 

  

effective january 1 2002 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142  goodwill and other intangible assets which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairmentonly approach and eliminates amortization of goodwill the segment operating results for 2001 have not been adjusted to exclude amortization of goodwill a reconciliation of previously reported 2001 financial information adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization is presented in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

  

backlog – funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer

the company’s operations substantially changed as a result of the trw acquisition on december 11 2002 the company’s 2002 income statement does not include trw’s postacquisition results because they were not material the 2002 results reflect the first full year of operations of litton eis and newport news which were acquired in 2001 these acquisitions have significantly increased the size of the company and produced one of the largest defense contractors in the nation 

  

the components of operating margin are as follows 

  

   

operating margin as a percentage of total revenue was 59 percent 81 percent and 79 percent for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the primary factors affecting operating margin during these periods were the business acquisitions and changes in pension amounts 

  

unallocated expenses 

2003 – unallocated expenses increased 36 million in 2003 net of a 17 million gain on the settlement of legal matters the increase is due primarily to higher legal costs and increased estimates of unrecoverable costs in 2003 the company settled two previously reserved civil false claims act cases us v newport news shipbuilding inc and us ex rel jordan and recorded loss provisions for settlement offers on other legal matters resulting in a net gain of 17 million the two settled cases required payments by the company of approximately 80 million 

  

the 60 million settlement amount allocated by the plaintiff to the newport news shipbuilding case was charged to an existing accrual established for the government’s claim that newport news had improperly charged certain independent research and development costs to its government contracts with respect to the years 1994 through 1999 the government filed a civil false claims act case against the company in february 2003 seeking single damages in excess of 72 million plus penalties costs and interest the company accrued an amount for this matter determined in accordance with sfas no 5 – accounting for contingencies  after considering the facts and circumstances known to management at the time including the potential for treble damages and penalties as 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

provided in the false claims act the accrual when established had no effect on the company’s net income as it was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as part of the purchase accounting for newport news which was acquired in december 2001 the unused portion of the accrual of approximately 120 million was reversed and together with the loss provisions recorded for other legal matters is included in the 17 million net gain reported in “unallocated expenses” 

  

pension expense income 

2003 – operating margin in 2003 includes pension expense of 568 million as compared with pension income in 2002 of 90 million the decrease reflects a higher number of plan participants from the acquisition of trw as well as negative returns on plan assets of 10 percent and 49 percent in 2002 and 2001 respectively based on expected longterm returns available in the capital markets and lower longterm interest rates the 2004 pension plan assumptions have been changed from the 2003 assumptions the 2004 assumptions include an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 875 percent and a discount rate of 625 percent compared with the 2003 assumptions of 9 percent and 65 percent respectively in accordance with sfas no 87 – employers’ accounting for pensions  the balance sheet was adjusted at december 31 2003 to reverse a significant portion of the additional minimum pension liability due to actual returns on pension plan assets in 2003 of over 20 percent this nearly 1 billion noncash aftertax increase in shareholders’ equity did not impact earnings 

  

beginning in july 2003 the pension benefits for most employees principally those participating in northrop grumman and litton heritage plans were based upon new criteria whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period subsequent to the 2003 initial phasein other exempt and nonexempt plans will be conformed to the new model no settlement or curtailments arose as a result of these changes union plans were not affected by these plan modifications 

  

pension expense is included in the sectors’ cost of sales to the extent that these costs are currently recognized under cas in order to reconcile from segment operating margin to total company operating margin these amounts are reported under the caption “reversal of cas pension expense included above” 

  

for 2004 subject to refinements for participant census data and payasyougo plans management expects pension expense determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of approximately 330 million pension expense recognized under cas which is generally recoverable under government contracts is estimated to be 305 million for 2004 

  

2002 – operating margin in 2002 includes pension income of 90 million compared with 335 million in 2001 the lower pension income in 2002 is principally the result of negative asset returns in 2001 and 2000 

  

other income statement components 

  

interest income 

2003 – interest income increased 49 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 the increase principally reflects earnings from the note received in connection with the sale of auto interest earned on a tax refund and interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash 

  

2002 – interest income in 2002 declined to 11 million compared with 33 million in 2001 interest income in 2001 included interest earned on the note received in partial payment for the sale of aerostructures the note was collected in 2001 interest income in 2002 and 2001 includes interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

interest expense 

2003 – interest expense increased by 75 million or 18 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 the increase is principally the result of higher debt levels arising from the acquisition of trw net of the effect of the company’s debt reduction plan which was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2003 dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are also treated as interest expense resulting from adoption of sfas no 150 – accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which became effective for periods ending after june 15 2003 

  

2002 – interest expense for 2002 was 422 million as compared with 373 million in 2001 the 2002 increase as compared with 2001 reflects higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2001 

  

income taxes 

2003 – the company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for 2003 was 29 percent compared to 31 percent during 2002 the lower rate in 2003 is primarily due to higher research tax credits the effective tax rate for 2004 is expected to be between 34 and 35 percent 

  

2002 – the company’s effective federal income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 31 percent in 2002 and 37 percent in 2001 the lower rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization most of which is nondeductible upon adoption of sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

discontinued operations 

2003 – the company reported aftertax income from discontinued operations of 35 million net of a goodwill impairment charge of 47 million during 2003 the 23 million aftertax gain from disposal of discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the sale of life support and poly scientific the gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations includes any gain or loss from completed dispositions as well as the estimated loss from those businesses expected to be sold at a loss where the sale has not yet been completed gains realized on the sale of any discontinued businesses are reported in the period in which the divestiture is complete

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

  

the company’s established policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as part of its oversight responsibilities management evaluates the propriety of its estimates judgments and accounting methods as new events occur management believes that its policies judgments and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company’s financial statements a current accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management periodically reviews the company’s critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

  

principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 

  

revenue recognition 

as a defense contractor engaging in longterm contracts the company extensively utilizes the costtocost and the unitsofdelivery measures of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting application of this accounting method requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the design manufacture and delivery of aircraft carriers submarines aircraft and subassemblies radars intricate components and systems for space communications as well as the engineering development and integration of software systems and other highly technical products such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company’s engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are reviewed and reassessed quarterly sales under costreimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred certain contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product incentives that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded certain contracts contain provisions for the redetermination of price based upon future economic conditions contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable 

  

purchase accounting and goodwill 

the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ from original estimates 

  

the company evaluates the recovery of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists in order to test for potential impairment the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions differences in these assumptions within a range considered by management to be reasonable applied to the 2003 annual impairment test would not have had a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies arising from its acquisitions and divestitures these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

purchase price allocation period the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase agreements and in most cases involve a significant degree of judgment management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase agreements known facts and an estimation of probable future events based on management’s experience and consultation with outside experts changes in facts and interpretation or anticipated future events may have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel in accordance with sfas no 5 – accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be required factors which could result in changes to the company’s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology the company believes it complies with environmental laws applicable to its operations the company does not believe that continued compliance with these environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however a significant change in laws the discovery of previously unknown contamination and other factors could result in expenditures that are materially greater than currently estimated 

  

retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease the principal assumptions that have a significant impact on the financial condition and operating results of the company are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates 

  

the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations the discount rate is generally based on the yield on highquality corporate fixedincome investments at the end of each year the appropriate discount rate is determined based on consultation with outside actuaries consideration of survey results the moody’s aa corporate bond rate and the results of a hypothetical longterm bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments taking into consideration the factors noted above the company lowered the discount rate to 625 percent at december 31 2003 from 65 percent at december 31 2002 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments for 2003 the company assumed an expected longterm rate 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

of return on plan assets of 9 percent on average the actual return on plan assets over the longterm has exceeded 9 percent however for 2004 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was lowered from 9 percent to 875 percent reflecting the generally expected moderation of longterm rates of return in the financial markets 

  

the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants 

  

differences in the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following impact on 2003 results 

  

   

other matters 

  

new accounting pronouncements

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations tableend   

business conditions 

northrop grumman provides technologically advanced innovative products services and solutions in defense and commercial electronics information technology systems integration space technology mission systems and nuclear and nonnuclear shipbuilding and systems as a prime contractor principal subcontractor partner or preferred supplier northrop grumman participates in many highpriority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states and abroad while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix lockheed martin corporation the boeing company and raytheon company are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time northrop grumman the second largest defense contractor competes against these and other companies for a number of programs both large and small intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman’s business and the defense industry it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract turn out to be a subcontractor it is not uncommon to compete with customers and simultaneously on other contracts to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in many industries northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government principally the department of defense dod the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 

the defense requirements of the united states and nato countries have shifted to being able to respond to one or more regional conflicts terrorist acts homeland security and proactive threat identification such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement deterrence policing or peacekeeping in addition the dod’s strategy continues to be affected by the general public’s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk as a result of these trends both the united states and nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide longrange surveillance and intelligence battle management and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world accordingly defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the realtime integration of individual surveillance information management strike and battle management platforms 

united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years defense spending in nato countries has stabilized while they continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain current indications are that the defense budget will increase over the next five years us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates or strives to participate must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation’s budget formulation and appropriation processes budget decisions made in this environment will have longterm consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry while the ultimate distribution of the budget remains uncertain the company believes that its technologies and programs will be viewed favorably in the upcoming strategic review and budget process 

northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth airborne surveillance battle management precision weapons systems integration defense electronics and information technology through its acquisitions of litton industries inc litton newport news shipbuilding inc newport news and trw inc trw the company now has a significant presence in space technology command control  intelligence federal and civil information systems missile systems and the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced extended or terminated 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred subsequent to termination the company received a termination for convenience notice on the triservice standoff attack missile tssam program in february 1995 in december 1996 the company filed a lawsuit against the us government in the us court of federal claims seeking the recovery of approximately 750 million for uncompensated performance costs investments and a reasonable profit on the program in prior years the company had charged to operations in excess of 600 million related to this program northrop grumman is unable to predict whether it will realize some or all of its claims none of which are recorded on its balance sheet from the us government on the tssam contract 

prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all u s government agencies given the company’s dependence on us government business suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s future 

the company does not make use of business arrangements or other business activities that involve socalled offbalance sheet variable interest or special purpose entities 

an individual company’s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products as well as its ability to provide the people facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency it is necessary to maintain as the company has sources for raw materials fabricated parts electronic components and major subassemblies in this manufacturing and systems integration environment effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations northrop grumman’s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives the company also believes that it maintains good relations with its employees approximately 19 percent of whom are covered by 37 collective bargaining agreements the company currently expects to complete negotiation of 11 collective bargaining agreements in 2003 two of these agreements covering over 6000 employees in the ships segment are in current negotiations which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2003 it is not expected that these negotiations will either individually or collectively cause a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 

the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of nonconforming items for a specified period of time most of the company’s product warranties are provided under government contracts and are generally recoverable from the customer

completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances sales under costreimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred certain contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product incentives which can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives which cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded certain contracts contain provisions for the redetermination of price based upon future economic conditions contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable 

  

purchase accounting and goodwill 

the company applies the purchase method of accounting to its acquisitions under this method the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values with the excess recorded as goodwill such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ from original estimates the company evaluates the recovery of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the evaluation requires judgment associated with factors used to test recoverability 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

the company is subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel in accordance with sfas no 5 – accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care cost future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

with respect to the previously described critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments has been consistently applied and has produced financial information which fairly depicts the results of operations for the years presented

sales 

  

yeartoyear sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 

  

net sales 

   

electronics systems segment sales increased by 752 million or 16 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001 growth in 2002 principally reflects a 184 million increase at aes due to increased volume on the f22 f35 bat firefinder and longbow missile programs c 4 isrn sales increased by 239 million in 2002 principally due to higher volume on international programs the space systems business area contributed an additional 192 million as a result of increased volume on sbirs high 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

electronics systems segment sales in 2001 reflect the addition of the litton and eis businesses which accounted for approximately 12 billion of increased sales as compared with 2000 contributing 101 million to aes 194 million to c 4 isrn 641 million to navigation systems 159 million to defensive electronic systems and 66 million to space systems aes increased sales in 2001 also reflect higher f16 block 60 combat avionics systems longbow and bat sales defensive electronic systems reflects higher eoir and targeting systems sales higher sales in “other” are due to increased automation and information systems sales for 2003 the company expects electronic systems segment sales to be between 59 billion and 61 billion 

ships segment sales increased substantially in 2002 as compared with 2001 principally due to inclusion of the two ship businesses acquired in 2001 for a full year in 2003 the company expects ships sales to be just over 5 billion 

information technology sales increased by 12 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001 this increase principally results from inclusion of a full year of litton operations in 2002 information technology sales increased by 21 billion in 2001 over 2000 the litton business acquired in 2001 and the three businesses acquired in 2000 accounted for approximately 2 billion of the increase contributing 13 billion to government information technology and 457 million to enterprise information technology for 2003 the company expects information technology sales to be between 47 billion and 49 billion 

integrated systems segment sales increased 9 percent in 2002 over 2001 principally from a 143 million increase in f35 sales and a 145 million increase in global hawk sales integrated systems sales in 2001 declined 5 percent as compared to 2000 primarily as a result of lower b2 revenue which decreased by 273 million the production phase of the b2 program was substantially completed in 2000 ongoing development work spares and other customer support for the operational aircraft program continues integrated systems revenue for 2003 is expected to be approximately 36 billion to 38 billion 

for 2003 mission systems sales are expected to be approximately 39 billion and space technology sales are expected to be approximately 25 billion 

  

funded order backlog 

  

the yearend funded order backlog is the sum of the previous yearend funded order backlog plus the year’s contract acquisitions minus the year’s sales backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made it is expected that approximately 68 percent of the 2002 yearend backlog will be converted into sales in 2003 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

  

   

total us government orders including those made on behalf of foreign governments fms comprised 84 percent of the backlog at the end of 2002 compared with 82 percent at the end of 2001 and 75 percent at the end of 2000 total foreign customer orders including fms accounted for 13 percent of the backlog in 2002 compared with 13 percent of the backlog at the end of 2001 and 22 percent at the end of 2000 domestic commercial business in backlog was 5 percent at the end of 2002 compared with 7 percent at the end of 2001 and 5 percent at the end of 2000

measures of performance 

effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairmentonly approach and eliminates amortization of goodwill in order to report on a comparable basis operating results discussed herein have been adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization and are presented below further details are contained in the “goodwill and other purchased intangible assets” footnote contained in the notes to the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k 

  

   

the company’s operating margin for 2002 was 1391 million compared with adjusted operating margin of 1234 in 2001 and adjusted operating margin of 1212 million in 2000 during 2001 the company’s operations substantially changed as a result of the litton eis and newport news acquisitions the 2002 results reflect the first full year with these acquired businesses these acquisitions have significantly increased the size of the company in the two year period and produced one of the largest defense contractors in the nation the trw acquisition was completed on december 11 2002 the company’s 2002 income statement does not include trw’s postacquisition results because they were not material the company is continuing the integration of the various businesses acquired to optimize operating performance 

electronic systems segment operating margin in 2002 was 435 million compared with adjusted operating margin of 430 million in 2001 and 220 million in 2000 operating margin for 2002 includes a pretax charge of 65 million for the f16 block 60 fixed price combat avionics program offsetting margin improvements across the sector the charge resulted from increased costs associated with the complexity of the final design for the integrated electronic warfare system portion of the sensor suite being delivered for the block 60 aircraft the complexity of the design finalized during the third quarter and the associated material costs exceeded that of the originally proposed configuration the contract which is currently in the emd and transition to production phases is expected to be completed in 2007 development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production work and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the work as work on these contracts progresses through the development stage into production the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced while management has used its best judgment to estimate costs future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates approximately half of the increase in 2001 operating margin over 2000 is due to the addition of the litton and eis businesses the remainder of the increase is primarily due to improved performance in land combat systems and automation and information for 2003 management expects operating margin of nearly 10 percent of sales 

ships segment operating margin was 306 million in 2002 compared with adjusted operating margin of 50 million in 2001 the increase is principally due to the newport news and litton acquisitions results in 2002 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

include a thirdquarter pretax charge of 87 million recorded upon completion of a comprehensive review of the estimated costs to complete the three remaining polar tanker ships the increased estimatetocomplete reflects a reduced learning curve experience ship to ship as well as onetime schedule penalties the remaining three ships are scheduled for delivery in 2003 2004 and 2005 the 2002 results also reflect an 11 million increase in operating margin in the lpd program as a result of improved performance and completion of the assessment of the lpdddg swap agreement with bath iron works also during the year the company reached an agreement to sell the partially complete structures and material associated with its cancelled commercial cruise ship program to norwegian cruise line and successfully concluded negotiations on the majority of the program’s vendor terminations resulting in a positive pretax thirdquarter adjustment of 69 million recorded to reverse previously established reserves following american classic voyages co’s amcv bankruptcy filing on october 19 2001 ships stopped work on project america an amcv cruise ship program to build two 1900passenger cruise ships this decision followed negotiations with the us maritime administration which had decided not to continue the guaranteed funding necessary to complete the construction of the ships as a result ships recorded a pretax charge to operating margin totaling 60 million in 2001 ships also reported a downward operating margin adjustment of 13 million on the polar tanker program in 2001 for 2003 management expects operating margin as a percent of sales in the mid6 percent range 

information technology segment operating margin in 2002 was 249 million compared with adjusted operating margin of 231 million in 2001 and 123 million in 2000 operating margin for 2002 includes a 20 million favorable pretax adjustment resulting from the restructuring of a technology services contract and a 16 million charge recorded on the contract with oracle relating to oracle’s enterprise license agreement with the state of california in an effort to maintain solid customer relations in july 2002 northrop grumman and oracle rescinded the contract with the state the increase in operating margin in 2001 over 2000 reflects the addition of the litton business and the three businesses acquired in late 2000 as well as higher enterprise information technology operating margin for 2003 management expects operating margin as a percent of sales to be nearly 6 percent 

integrated systems segment operating margin in 2002 was 331 million compared with adjusted operating margin of 297 million in 2001 and 337 million in 2000 the 2002 results reflect improved performance on the b2 and e2c programs as well as higher f35 sales in 2001 integrated systems reported a 20 million positive adjustment for joint stars contract closeouts improved joint stars operating margin and downward cumulative margin rate adjustments on unmanned vehicle contracts totaling 10 million results for 2001 also reflect lower b2 volume in 2000 the last three b2’s were delivered under the production contract following the award of the last increment of production funding for the b2 the company began recording future operating margin increases on all production aircraft as these units were delivered and accepted by the customer at the time each unit was delivered an assessment was made of the status of the production contract to estimate the amount of any probable additional margin available beyond that previously recognized that unit’s proportionate share of any such unrecognized remaining balance was then recorded the company believes that this method allowed margin improvements to be recognized on a more demonstrable basis all 15 production units have been delivered integrated systems 2000 results reflect upward cumulative margin rate adjustments totaling 16 million on the fa18ef program and the effect of nonrecurring relocation and realignment costs associated with the sale of the commercial aerostructures business and the relocation of the sector’s headquarters for 2003 operating margin as a percent of sales is expected to be between 8 percent and 85 percent 

for 2003 management estimates operating margin as a percent of sales to be approximately 6 percent for mission systems and between 65 percent and 7 percent for space technology these estimates were developed using preliminary estimates for fair value and conformance adjustments including an estimate for annual purchased intangibles amortization expense of 52 million for each sector management is still in the preliminary stages of determining fair value and conformance adjustments and the actual results could differ significantly from the estimates used 

operating margin in 2002 includes pension income of 90 million compared with 335 million in 2001 and 538 million in 2000 the lower pension income in 2002 and 2001 is principally the result of negative asset 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

  

returns in 2001 and 2000 while in both years the company’s pension fund returns exceeded benchmark indices they posted a negative return of 49 percent in 2001 and a negative return at slightly less than breakeven in 2000 in 2002 the funds posted a negative return of 10 percent for 2003 the company has lowered its assumption for expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 95 percent to 9 percent to better reflect current longterm expectations for the plans’ portfolios the company has also lowered its assumption for the discount rate for obligations from 7 percent to 65 percent to reflect current rates as of december 31 2002 for highquality corporate long term bonds as a result of the negative return on assets in 2002 the change in assumptions and the inclusion of the trw pension plans the company expects to record pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 – employers accounting for pensions  in 2003 of approximately 600 million pension expense recognized under government cost accounting standards cas and which is therefore generally recoverable under government contracts is estimated to be 260 million for 2003 the company estimates pension plan contributions in 2003 to be approximately 350 million starting in july 2003 the pension benefit for most employees principally those participating in northrop and litton heritage plans will be based upon new criteria whereby employees earn age and service points over the employment period subsequent to the 2003 initial phase in other exempt and nonexempt plans will be conformed to the new model no settlement or curtailments will arise as a result of these changes union plans will not be affected by these plan modifications pension estimates for 2003 contemplate the plan changes 

interest income in 2002 declined to 11 million compared with 33 million in 2001 and 29 million in 2000 interest income in 2001 and 2000 included interest earned on the note received in partial payment for the sale of aerostructures the note was collected in 2001 interest income in all years includes interest earned on the temporary investment of excess cash 

interest expense for 2002 was 422 million as compared with 373 million in 2001 and 175 million in 2000 the 2002 increase as compared with 2001 reflects higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2001 the increase in 2001 as compared with 2000 resulted from the company’s initial financing activities related to the acquisitions of litton eis and newport news total debt was 96 billion at the end of 2002 compared to 55 billion at the end of 2001 and 16 billion at the end of 2000 the 2002 year end balance includes 48 billion of debt acquired upon completion of the trw transaction on december 11 2002 following the sale of auto in the first quarter of 2003 the company has commenced the first phase of its debt reduction plan interest expense net of interest income for 2003 is estimated to be approximately 470 million 

the company’s effective federal income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 31 percent in 2002 37 percent in 2001 and 36 percent in 2000 the lower rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization most of which is nondeductible upon adoption of sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets in 2003 the company’s effective federal income tax rate is expected to decrease to 28 percent due to increased research and development credits 

income loss from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 includes the results of operations of the electron devices and ruggedized displays businesses which were sold in 2002 and the component technologies sector loss from discontinued operations in 2002 includes a goodwill impairment loss of 186 million the amount reported for 2000 includes the commercial aerostructures business which was sold in that year 

the loss on disposal of discontinued operations includes any gain or loss from completed dispositions as well as the estimated loss from those businesses expected to be sold at a loss where the sale has not yet been completed gains realized on the sale of any discontinued businesses are reported in the period in which their divestiture is complete 

effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets implemented required disclosure provisions and eliminated the amortization of goodwill during the second quarter of 2002 the company completed the first step of the required initial test for potential impairment of goodwill on the balance sheet at january 1 2002 the company used a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate to determine the fair value of reporting units the results indicated potential impairment only in the reporting units of the component technologies sector due 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

to unfavorable market conditions during the third quarter of 2002 the company completed the measurement of the component technologies goodwill impairment as of january 1 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of 432 million or 367 per diluted share which is reported in the caption “cumulative effect of accounting change” for additional information see the “goodwill and other purchased intangible assets” footnote to the consolidated condensed financial statements contained in this report on form 10k 

  

measures of liquidity and capital resources 

the following table is a condensed summary of the detailed cash flow information contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows amounts listed below are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows cash from customers and cash to employees and suppliers of services and materials are included in cash from operating activities cash from buyers of assets and cash to sellers of assets and suppliers of facilities are included in cash from investing activities and cash from and to lenders and cash to shareholders are included in cash from financing activities 

  

   

in 2002 cash provided from operating activities was 1689 million as compared with the 817 million generated in 2001 and the 1010 million generated in 2000 the increased level of cash provided in 2002 principally results from inclusion of the litton and newport news acquisitions for a full year increased operating margin over 2001 and accelerated cash collections the lower level of cash provided by operating activities in 2001 primarily reflected nonrecurring cash payments of approximately 700 million related to the litton newport news and eis acquisitions including change in control payments to employees and funding of pension plans also in 2001 the company reached a settlement agreement for antitrust and patent infringement lawsuits filed by litton against honeywell inc under the agreement honeywell agreed to pay the company 440 million in cash 220 million of which was paid equally in 2001 and 2002 the entire 440 million balance due was recorded as a fair value purchase accounting adjustment to accounts receivable on the litton opening balance sheet interest expense payments increased by 168 million in 2001 over 2000 as a result of the increase in debt to fund the business acquisitions in 2000 cash from operations benefited from lower interest payments reflecting the lower level of debt and higher cash advances from customers 

net working capital current assets less current liabilities at december 31 2002 includes amounts reported as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale which encompasses the assets and liabilities of discontinued businesses component technologies sector and auto applicable amounts for the prior year have been revised to conform to the 2002 presentation excluding these items net adjusted working capital at december 31 2002 was a negative 566 million primarily due to increased current taxes payable and customer advances 

  

northrop grumman corporation 

  

adjusted net working capital at december 31 2001 was a negative 604 million mainly due to valuation reserves established in purchase accounting and an increase in the current portion of longterm debt arising from the company’s financing activities one of the largest components of the change in tax liabilities is the tax expense related to longterm contracts with the completion of the b2 emd contract federal and state income taxes that have been deferred during the performance of this contract will become payable the contract was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 with associated federal taxes of approximately 1 billion paid in march 2003 

in accordance with sfas no 87 – employers’ accounting for pension the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2002 includes the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability this adjustment was a noncash 994 million aftertax reduction of equity which did not effect earnings and is potentially reversible should the performance of the capital markets improve or interest rates increase
