 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to impact a significant majority of the regions in which we operate resulting in significant global business disruptions the impacts of covid19 continue to materially adversely impact our operations cash flow and liquidity the virus has impacted all regions around the world resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national state and local authorities these requirements resulted in temporary closures of the majority of the companys directly operated stores globally for some period of time to help reduce the spread of covid19 during fiscal 2020 throughout fiscal years 2021 and 2022 the vast majority of the company’s stores were opened and have continued to operate however some store locations have experienced temporary reclosures or operated under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulations many of the company’s wholesale partners also experienced closure of their stores or operating restrictions during the fiscal year as required by government orders the company’s performance in fiscal 2022 was adversely impacted as a result of infections due to variants of covid19 in certain regions most notably in greater china which resulted in disruption in business performance including a decline in demand in the region while the trends for greater china started to improve at the end of fiscal 2022 the situation continues to be very volatile and infection rates and government restrictions may continue to persist covid19 has also resulted in ongoing supply chain challenges such as logistic constraints the closure of certain thirdparty manufacturers and increased freight cost 

the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the ultimate duration severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus including the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants or treat its impact such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines among others while the full magnitude of the effects on our business continues to be difficult to predict the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations our business may continue to be adversely impacted by several factors including but not limited to 

• we source and manufacture our products on a global scale and we have and may continue to experience material temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain given the global reach of the covid19 pandemic 

• travel restrictions closures or disruptions of business and facilities including manufacturing facilities and raw material providers unavailability of vaccines for our international employees or workers in our supply chain or social economic political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of our raw material suppliers or manufacturing partners this disruption to our supply chain has resulted and may continue to result in inventory not being available in a timely manner andor during the appropriate season and freight and other logistics costs including increased carrier rates for ocean and air shipments as the supply chain disruptions have caused us to increase our use of air freight with greater frequency than in the past all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

• the potential economic effects of the pandemic including a possible recession or inflationary pressures increased unemployment and decreased consumer credit availability may result in lower consumer confidence and decreased disposable income and discretionary spending levels which may lead to reduced sales of our products unfavorable economic conditions fears of becoming ill and sustained travel restrictions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which the company’s stores are located furthermore reduced discretionary spending may result in an excess of inventory throughout the industry which could lead to increased pressure on our gross margin in the near term if the company has to increase promotional activity above its normal levels to sell through its existing product 

• social distancing measures and general consumer behaviors due to the covid19 pandemic may continue to impact mall and store traffic even as stores return to normal operations which may have a further negative impact on our business furthermore declines in traffic beyond our current expectations could result in additional impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

• we continue to sell products through our stores and through our ecommerce sites the majority of our fulfillment centers remain open and operational through the date of this report however such fulfillment centers may be forced to close or limit operations due to governmental mandates health and safety concerns or illness or absence of a substantial number of distribution center employees we may not be able to keep up with demand for our products because we have and may continue to experience delays in or increased costs for the shipment or delivery of our products due to capacity constraints shipping delays or port congestion 

economic conditions such as an economic recession downturn periods of inflation or uncertainty could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels tax rates levels of unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs pandemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and natural disasters fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production supply chain operations commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors 

many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general economic and business conditions high levels of unemployment periods of inflation health pandemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

unfavorable economic conditions as well as travel restrictions and potential changes in consumer behavior resulting from the covid19 pandemic may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

risks related to our business and our industry 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 376 of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states as of the end of fiscal year 2022 while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets including the potential impact of 1 new policies that may be implemented by the us or other jurisdictions particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or 2 sanctions and related activities by the united states european union “eu” and others 

• public health crises such as pandemics and epidemic diseases including the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• changes to the uss participation in withdrawal out of renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the nonrenewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries tariff quotas and retaliatory tariffs trade sanctions new or onerous trade restrictions embargoes and other stringent government controls 

• changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products result in decreased international consumer demand or increase our supply costs in those markets with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates 

• compliance with laws relating to foreign operations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act and other global anticorruption laws which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials and other regulations and requirements 

• changes in tourist shopping patterns particularly that of the chinese consumer and as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• natural and other disasters 

• political civil and social unrest such as the ongoing crisis in ukraine and 

• changes in legal and regulatory requirements including but not limited to safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change and other environmental legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

• continued disruptions or delays in shipments whether due to port congestion logistics carrier disruption other shipping capacity constraints or other factors which has and may continue to result in significantly increased inbound freight costs and increased intransit times 

• loss or disruption of key manufacturing or fulfillment sites or extended closure of such sites due to the covid19 pandemic or other unexpected factors 

• imposition of additional duties taxes and other charges or restrictions on imports or exports 

• unavailability or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 

• compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations 

• increases in the cost of labor fuel including volatility in the price of oil travel and transportation 

• compliance with our global business integrity program 

• compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our supplier code of conduct social auditing procedures and requirements and other applicable compliance policies 

• compliance with applicable laws and regulations including us laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of “conflict minerals” sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company’s products other laws and regulations regarding the sourcing of materials in the company’s products the fcpa uk bribery act and other global anticorruption laws as applicable and other us and international regulations and requirements 

• regulation or prohibition of the transaction of business with specific individuals or entities and their affiliates or goods manufactured in certain regions by any government or regulatory authority in the jurisdictions where we conduct business such as the listing of a person or entity as a specially designated national or blocked person by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and the issuance of withhold release orders by the us customs and border patrol 

• inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company’s costeffective sourcing model 

• product quality issues 

• political unrest including the ongoing crisis in ukraine protests and other civil disruption 

• public health crises such as pandemic and epidemic diseases and other unforeseen outbreaks 

• natural disasters or other extreme weather events whether as a result of climate change or otherwise 

• acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control 

we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our supplier code of conduct and other compliance policies under our global business integrity program however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program documents including our global operating principles anticorruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwtapestrycom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation in addition if there is negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers even if unfounded or not specific to our supply chain our reputation and sales could be adversely affected we could be subject to legal liability or could cause us to contract with alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be materially impacted if our distribution and fulfillment centers face significant interruptions and operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of fulfillment and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers depending on the duration of these closures our results may be materially impacted while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and fulfillment center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or fulfillment for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business 

because our fulfillment centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches in north america we maintain fulfillment centers in jacksonville florida and westchester ohio operated by tapestry globally we utilize fulfillment centers in mainland china the netherlands the uk and spain owned and operated by thirdparties allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also utilize local fulfillment centers through thirdparties in japan parts of greater china mainland china hong kong sar macao sar and taiwan south korea singapore malaysia spain the uk canada australia and starting in fiscal 2023 in mexico the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations in addition increases in the company’s ecommerce sales has required additional fulfillment and fulfillment capacity additionally in fiscal year 2022 the company entered into a lease agreement for a multibrand fulfillment facility to be built in las vegas nevada in order to increase capacity and improve fulfillment capabilities as the company continues to focus on expanding its digital and ecommerce business any delay in the construction or our failure to execute our operational plans for this fulfillment center could result in the company not being able to meet customer demand for its products and could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 closures operating restrictions store capacity restrictions and changes in consumer shopping behavior as a result of the covid19 pandemic 2 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 3 surrounding tenants or vacancies 4 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 5 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 6 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our global omnichannel expansion efforts and our ability to execute our digital and ecommerce priorities 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design introduction of new products and maintaining an appropriate rationalization of our assortment our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends see “ the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner” the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to rationalize our assortment appropriately could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

our success and growth also depends on the continued development of our omnichannel presence for each of our brands globally leaning into global digital opportunities for each brand along with continued bricks and mortar expansion in select international regions notably mainland china with respect to international expansion our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets either through bricks and mortar stores or digital channels have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor privacy transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further expanding in certain markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient 

revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm we may also have to compete for talent in international regions as we expand our omnichannel presence 

consequently if our global omnichannel expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we have incorporated key strategies of our acceleration program one of which is to leverage data and lead with a digitalfirst mindset including offering satisfying customer experiences across our ecommerce and social channels and meeting the needs of our customers who are engaging with our brands digitally we aim to provide a seamless omnichannel experience to our customers regardless of whether they are shopping in stores or engaging with our brands through digital technology such as computers mobile phones tablets or other devices this requires investment in new technologies and reliance on third party digital partners over which we may have limited control additionally our digital business is subject to numerous risks that could adversely impact our results including i a diversion of sales from our brand stores or wholesale customers ii difficulty in recreating the instore experience through digital channels iii liability for online content iv changing dynamics within the digital marketing environment and our ability to effectively market to consumers v intense competition from online retailers and vi the ability to provide timely delivery of ecommerce purchases which is dependent on the capacity and operations of our owned and third party operated fulfillment facilities see “ our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities” for additional risks related to our distribution and fulfillment networks if we are unable to effectively execute our ecommerce and digital strategies and provide reliable experiences for our customers across all channels our reputation and ability to compete with other brands could suffer which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

our business and future success depends heavily on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have experienced numerous changes to our senior leadership team there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or that we will be able to identify and attract suitable successors for these individuals the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the direct or indirect consequences of results thereof or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals or the loss of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

we must also attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified retail and fulfillment center employees historically competition for talent in these positions has been intense and turnover is generally high both of which have been exacerbated by the ongoing covid19 pandemic if we are unable to attract and retain such employees with the necessary skills and experience we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

additionally changes to our office environments the adoption of new work models and our requirements andor expectations about when or how often certain employees work onsite or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees as businesses increasingly operate remotely traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict if our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees 

the successful incorporation of our acceleration program is key to the longterm success of our business 

the company’s acceleration program focused on how to better meet the needs of each of its brands unique customers by i sharpening our focus on the customer ii leveraging data and leading with a digitalfirst mindset and iii transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization the company does not expect to incur further expenses related to the acceleration program in fiscal 2023 the company believes the successful incorporation of these priorities will fuel desire for the coach kate spade and stuart weitzman brands driving accelerated revenue growth higher gross margins and substantial operating leverage across tapestry’s portfolio 

the acceleration program reflects i actions to streamline the companys organization ii select store closures as the company optimizes its fleet including store closure costs incurred as the company exits certain regions in which it currently operates and iii professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the companys comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability 

the company believes that longterm growth and increased profitability can be realized through its strategic growth efforts over time however there is no assurance that we will be able to sustain such efforts in accordance with our plans that such 

efforts will result in the intended or otherwise desirable outcomes or that such efforts even if successfully sustained will be effective in achieving longterm growth or increased profitability refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 restructuring activities for further information regarding the acceleration program further potential changes in our executive leadership team may have an adverse effect on our ability to implement or to achieve favorable results under the acceleration program andor result in further changes to our strategy 

if our incorporation of the initiatives under our acceleration program falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers competition is based on a number of factors including without limitation the following 

• our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers 

• anticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences including the everincreasing shift to digital brand engagement social media communications and online and crosschannel shopping 

• maintaining strong brand recognition loyalty and a reputation for quality including through digital brand engagement and online and social media presence 

• recruiting and retaining key talent 

• developing and producing innovative highquality products in sizes colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age group 

• competitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers including price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures while simultaneously balancing the risk of lower consumer demand in response to any such price increases 

• providing strong and effective marketing support in several diverse demographic markets including through digital and social media platforms in order to stay better connected to consumers 

• providing attractive reliable secure and userfriendly digital commerce sites 

• sourcing sustainable raw materials at costeffective prices 

• ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party suppliers and retailers 

• protecting our trademarks and design patents and 

• the ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions 

a failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences and technology and product trends could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products or demand for our products are impacted by other factors such as inflationary pressures political instability or the ongoing covid19 pandemic we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products we have in the past been and may in the future be forced to rely on donation markdowns promotional sales or other writeoffs to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin our costs for raw materials are affected by among other things weather customer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus customer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control any of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change in addition ongoing impacts of the pandemic political instability trade relations sanctions price inflationary pressure or other geopolitical or economic conditions could cause raw material costs to increase and have an adverse effect on our future margins labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to 

grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly if oil prices continue to rise we have also experienced increased freight and other logistics costs including increased carrier rates for ocean and air shipments in addition the supply chain disruptions have caused us to increase our use of air freight with greater frequency than in the past we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

tapestry inc is a new yorkbased house of accessible luxury lifestyle brands our global house of brands unites the magic of coach kate spade new york and stuart weitzman each of our brands are unique and independent while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies any misstep in product quality or design executive leadership customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted 

the shift towards digital engagement has become increasingly important with increased use of social media platforms by our brand representatives influencers and our employees actions taken by our partners on social media that do not show our brands in a manner consistent with our desired image or that are damaging to such partner’s reputation whether or not through our brand social media platforms could harm our brand reputation and materially impact our business 

our success also depends in part on our and our executive leadership teams ability to execute on our plans and strategies even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers including as a result of changes in social political and economic conditions including those resulting from military conflicts or other hostilities that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry 

our wholesale business comprised approximately 11 of total net sales for fiscal 2022 the retail industry including wholesale customers has experienced financial difficulty leading to consolidations reorganizations restructuring bankruptcies and ownership changes in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in reduced operations or the closure temporarily or permanently of many of our wholesale partners this may continue and could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of wholesale stores that carry our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have in the past been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise and may do so again in the future which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy historically has been acquisitions acquisitions are not currently contemplated in the companys capital allocation priorities however our management team may in the future evaluate and consider other strategic investments or acquisitions these involve various inherent risks and the benefits cost savings and synergies sought may not be realized 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

• failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets 

• delays unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets 

• higher than expected costs lower than expected cost savings or synergies andor a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties 

• difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations 

• diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations 

• the impact on our or an acquired business’ internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

• unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations 

• unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators 

• retaining key customers suppliers and employees 

• retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals licenses and permits 

• operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business 

• lower than anticipated demand for product offerings by us or our licensees 

• assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence and 

• other unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities 

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year business underperformance in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

our brands currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for certain products in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as do unique risks stemming from problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the licensed product categories further while we believe that we 

could replace our existing licensing partners if required any delay in doing so could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under noncancelable leases many of which have historically had initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option in certain cases as we have done in the past we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize consolidate reposition relocate or close some of our real estate locations in such cases we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally due to the volatile economic environment it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases this may impact our ability to manage the profitability of our store locations or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets if market values decline any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to information security and technology 

a delay disruption in failure of or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations including management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our brands’ stores our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems in addition from time to time we implement new systems 

implementing new systems carries substantial risk including failure to operate as designed failure to properly integrate with other systems potential loss of confidential and personal information cost overruns implementation delays and disruption of operations furthermore failure of our computer systems due to inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security and personal data breaches system upgrades or migration of these services as well as employee and consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations individually or in accumulation could have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a personal data or security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers stores and vendors the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital and local marketing efforts data analytics collection use and retention of customer data employee vendor and partner information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space due to persistent covid19 risks our company decided to implement a hybrid working model recently many of our corporate employees and independent contractors returned to offices several days a week but continued to work remotely the other days continued remote working due to the covid19 pandemic has increased our dependence on digital technology during this period the possibility of a successful cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information and personal data over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable and adequate security measures and data protection we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a personal data or security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products 

digitally we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random cyberattacks personal data or security breaches acts of vandalism computer malware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events further like other companies in the retail industry during the ordinary course of business we and our vendors have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks of varying degrees and types including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that cyberattacks will not have a material impact in the future 

awareness and sensitivity to personal data breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees vendors and investors we have been incurring and expect that we will continue to incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with current and new international federal and state laws governing the unauthorized disclosure or exfiltration of confidential and personal information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation gdpr in the eu the uk gdpr the american data privacy and protection act the california consumer privacy act ccpa the california privacy rights act cpra the virginia consumer data protection act vcdpa the colorado privacy act cpa and the utah consumer privacy act and the connecticut data privacy act ctdpa in the usa as well as increased cyber security and privacy protection costs such as organizational changes covid19 employee and visitor health checks copies of vaccination cards deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees engaging outside counsel third party experts and consultants we may also experience loss of revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breach containment and notification costs to supervisory authorities and the affected data subjects and increased litigation and customer claims as a result of cyber security or personal data breaches while we carry cyber liability insurance such insurance may not cover us with respect to any or all claims or costs associated with such a breach 

in addition we have ecommerce sites in certain countries throughout the world including the us canada japan mainland china several throughout europe australia and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally tapestry has informational websites in various countries given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer databases and iv ability to email or otherwise keep in contact with our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security and personal data breaches email blocking lists computer malware or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems and applications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to environmental social and governance issues 

the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change including through disruption to our supply chain potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products including availability and pricing of raw materials as well as shipping disruptions andor higher freight costs climate change can lead to physical and transition risks impacting our business the physical risks result from climatic events such as wildfires storms and floods whereas transition risks result from policy action taken to transition the economy off of fossil fuels increased frequency andor intensity of extreme weather events such as storms and floods due to climate change could also lead to more frequent store and fulfillment center closures adversely impacting retail traffic andor consumers disposable income levels or spending habits on discretionary items or otherwise disrupt business operations in the communities in which we operate any of which could result in lost sales or higher costs 

there is also increased focus from our stakeholders including consumers employees and investors on climate change issues many countries in which we and our suppliers operate have begun to enact new legislation and regulations in an attempt to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change which could result in higher sourcing operational and compliancerelated costs for the company such proposed measures include expanded disclosure requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other climaterelated information as well as independent auditors providing some level of attestation to the accuracy of such disclosures inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect our compliance costs with such laws and regulations an assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulations or industry standards as well as any international treaties and accords will be fraught with uncertainty given the wide scope of potential 

regulatory change in the countries in which we operate any failure on our part to comply with such climate changerelated regulations could lead to adverse consumer actions andor investment decisions by investors as well as expose us to legal risk 

increased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our corporate social responsibility initiatives including environmental social governance and other matters of significance relating to sustainability could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation 

stakeholders including consumers employees and investors have increasingly focused on corporate responsibility practices of companies although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 corporate responsibility goals there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals on a timely basis or at all could damage our reputation causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our company and brands and negatively impact our operations in addition our brand is susceptible to risks associated with changing consumer attitudes regarding social and political issues and consumer perceptions of our position on these issues 

any corporate responsibility report that we publish or other sustainability disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters including corporate governance environmental compliance employee health and safety practices human capital management product quality supply chain management and workforce inclusion and diversity it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of our adoption of these practices we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices and various legal legislative and regulatory requirements also our failure or perceived failure to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could negatively impact our reputation employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us 

risks related to global economic conditions and legal and regulatory matters 

we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products 

most of our imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products to maximize opportunities we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and as a result we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our crossborder activity for example we have historically received benefits from dutyfree imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the us generalized system of preferences gsp program the gsp program expired on december 31 2020 resulting in additional duties that have negatively impacting gross margin additionally we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities including related to us customs and border protection cbp enforcement actions the imposition of taxes duties and quotas the withdrawal from or material modification to trade agreements andor if cbp detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition since fiscal 2019 the us and china have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs however while the us has participated in multinational negotiations on trade agreements and duty rates there continues to be a possibility of increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us from other countries which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations as a result 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly effective tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

over the past year there has been significant discussion with regards to tax legislation by both the biden administration and the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15 minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1 excise tax on share repurchases the inflation reduction act of 2022 will become effective beginning in fiscal 2024 given its recent pronouncement it is unclear at this time what if any impact the inflation reduction act of 2022 will have on the companys tax rate and financial results we will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements we hedge certain cross currency intercompany inventory transactions and foreign currency balance sheet exposures as well as the company’s cross currency intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide despite our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we pursue entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal and investigative fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of july 2 2022 our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 170 billion in fiscal year 2022 the company issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 3050 senior unsecured notes due march 15 2032 at 99705 of par the 2032 senior notes and completed a partial cash tender offer of the outstanding aggregate of its 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 4250 senior unsecured notes due april 1 2025 at 99445 of par the 2025 senior notes and its 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2027 at 99858 of par the 2027 senior notes together with the 2032 senior notes and 2025 senior notes the senior notes in addition the company financed and replaced the 9000 million revolving credit facility by entering into a new credit facility that i includes an increased revolving credit facility the 125 billion revolving credit facility from 9000 million to 125 billion ii includes an unsecured 5000 million term loan the term loan and iii redefines certain terms within the existing revolving credit facility the unsecured 500 million term loan was utilized to satisfy the company’s remaining obligation under its 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 3000 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2022 at 99505 of par the 2022 senior notes additionally the borrowings may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our 125 billion revolving credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a maximum net leverage ratio of 40 to 10 as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets refer to note 12 debt for a summary of these terms and additional information on the terms of our 125 billion revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding senior notes 

the consequences and limitations under our 125 billion revolving credit facility and our other outstanding indebtedness could impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions in addition a prolonged disruption in our business may impact our ability to satisfy the leverage ratio covenant under our 125 billion revolving credit facility noncompliance with these terms would constitute an event of default under our 125 billion revolving credit facility which may result in acceleration of payment to the lenders in the event of an acceleration of payment to the lenders this would result in a cross default of the company’s senior notes causing the company’s outstanding borrowings to also become due and payable on demand 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control including the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

as a result of having operations outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that when possible it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales operating income net interest expense earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections we did not provide detailed guidance in our earnings reports for the second half of fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of covid19 on our business we resumed providing guidance for fiscal year 2022 and while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to provide guidance going forward or to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases on march 26 2020 we announced we were suspending our quarterly dividend payment effective beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and stock repurchase program due to the impact of covid19 pandemic starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the company’s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the companys shareholder return program declaring a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per common share for an annual dividend rate of 100 per share or approximately 260 million returned to shareholders in fiscal 2022 the “shareholder return program” additionally during fiscal 2022 the company repurchased 420 million shares of common stock for 160 billion the company also intends to repurchase approximately 7000 million worth of stock in fiscal 2023 all of which is remaining under its current authorization investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at a certain time and at certain levels and  or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors’ expectations refer to “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be negatively impacted ” for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be negatively impacted 

on march 26 2020 the company announced that due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic tapestry’s quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 along with the stock repurchase program would be suspended in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the company’s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the companys shareholder return program the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases or conduct either program at expected levels after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares without stockholder approval although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of the giving of the notice by the stockholder pursuant to the companys bylaws and at the time of the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including mergers consolidations share exchanges or in circumstances specified in the statute asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities between the company and any interested stockholder generally defined as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 

the company’s charter provides that except as may be provided by our board in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock any vacancy on our board may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum the company’s charter further provides that a director may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors this provision when coupled with the exclusive power of our board to fill vacant directorships may preclude stockholders from removing incumbent directors except by a substantial affirmative vote and filling the vacancies created by such removal with their own nominees 

our bylaws designate the circuit court for baltimore city maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions including derivative actions which could limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers other employees or the companys stockholders and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for a any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company b any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the company to the company or to the stockholders of the company c any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company arising pursuant to any provision of the maryland general corporation law the charter or the bylaws of the company or d any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be the circuit court for baltimore city maryland or if that court does not have jurisdiction the united states district court for the district of maryland baltimore division this exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under maryland state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction 

although we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of maryland law for the specified types of actions and proceedings this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims

the disruptions related to covid19 have materially adversely impacted our operations cash flow and liquidity the virus has impacted all regions around the world resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national state and local authorities these requirements resulted in closures of our directly operated stores globally as well as our wholesale and licensing partners causing a significant reduction in sales starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the vast majority of the companys stores and locations of our wholesale and licensing partners have reopened certain have experienced temporary reclosures or are operating under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulations the companys performance in fiscal 2022 was adversely impacted as a result of infections due to variants of covid19 in certain regions most notably in greater china which resulted in disruptions in business performance including a decline in demand in the region while the trends in greater china started to improve at the end of fiscal 2022 the situation continues to be very volatile and infection rates and government restrictions may continue to persist 

furthermore covid19 has and may continue to cause disruptions in the company’s supply chain within our thirdparty manufacturers and logistics providers during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 certain of the company’s thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in vietnam experienced ongoing and longerthanexpected government mandated restrictions which resulted in a significant decrease in production capacity for these thirdparty manufacturers in response the company took deliberate actions such as shifting production to other countries adjusting its merchandising strategies where possible and increasing the use of air freight to expedite delivery based on these actions and the improved production levels since the first quarter the company has been able to meet anticipated levels of demand 

the company has been experiencing other global logistics challenges such as delays as a result of port congestion vessel availability container shortages for imported products and rising freight costs to mitigate delays the company strategically used air freight with greater frequency than in the past primarily in the second and third fiscal quarter of 2022 due to these logistical challenges during fiscal 2022 the company recognized within cost of sales 1785 million of incremental freight costs compared to fiscal 2021 in order to maintain product flow to meet consumer demand 

there is still uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic and challenges are expected to persist into fiscal 2023 including the possibility of other effects on the business we will continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation pertaining to the covid19 outbreak including guidance from international and domestic authorities and adjust our operating plan as needed refer to part i item 1a risk factors herein 

the company continues to take strategic actions in response to the current environment the company remains committed to driving sga savings including actions taken under the acceleration program the company will continue to consider nearterm exigencies and the longterm financial health of the business as clear steps are taken to mitigate the consequences of the covid19 pandemic

crisis in ukraine 

in the second half of fiscal 2022 a humanitarian crisis unfolded in ukraine which has created significant economic uncertainty in the region the company does not have directly operated stores in russia or ukraine and has a minimal distributor and wholesale business which was less than 01 of the company’s total net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the company paused all wholesale shipments to russia and ukraine the companys total business in europe represented less than 5 of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 total net sales 

current trends and outlook 

the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending consumer preferences macroeconomic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies 

the outbreak of a novel strain of covid19 continues to impact a significant majority of the regions in which we operate resulting in significant global business disruptions the widespread impact of covid19 resulted in temporary closures of directly operated stores globally as well as at our wholesale and licensing partners starting in fiscal 2020 since then certain directly operated stores and the stores of our wholesale and licensing partners have experienced temporary reclosures or are operating under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulation the companys performance in fiscal 2022 was adversely impacted as a result of infections due to variants of covid19 in certain regions most notably in greater china which resulted in disruptions in business performance including a decline in demand in the region furthermore as discussed in recent developments covid19 has also resulted in ongoing supply chain challenges such as logistic constraints the closure of certain thirdparty manufacturers and increased freight costs 

we continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions about the pandemic for purposes of our business and operating results including assumptions regarding the duration severity and global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic however the full extent of the impact of covid19 on our business and operating results will depend largely on future events outside of our control including the ultimate duration severity and geographic resurgence of the virus and the success of actions to contain the virus including variants of the novel strain or treat its impact among others 

several organizations that monitor the world’s economy including the international monetary fund continue to forecast growth in the global economy however some of these organizations have recently revised the forecast downward since the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily to reflect a higherthananticipated slowdown in greater china reflective of covid19 outbreaks and lockdown and further negative economic impacts due to the crisis in ukraine inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than in previous forecasts and concerns regarding an oncoming recession have increased in recent months 

certain markets around the world have been faced with labor shortages which have not impacted the companys operations to date if these trends continue or worsen it could potentially affect the companys ability to attract and retain employees for its retail and fulfillment locations in the future 

furthermore currency volatility political instability and potential changes to trade agreements or duty rates may contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment or adversely impact our business since fiscal 2019 the us and china have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs additionally the company has historically benefited from dutyfree imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the us generalized system of preferences “gsp” program the gsp program expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting in additional duties that have negatively impacting gross profit 

over the past year there has been significant discussion with regards to tax legislation by both the biden administration and the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15 minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1 excise tax on share repurchases the inflation reduction act of 2022 will become effective beginning in fiscal 2024 given its recent pronouncement it is unclear at this time what if any impact the inflation reduction act of 2022 will have on the companys tax rate and financial results we will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and the reported loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2022 reflect certain items including the impact of debt extinguishment costs in fiscal 2022 acceleration program costs in fiscal 2022 and 2021 and the cares act tax impact and impairment costs in fiscal 2021 as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

furthermore the company has disclosed the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 on net sales operating income and earnings per diluted share results 

the company has historically reported comparable store sales which reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from ecommerce sites the company excludes new stores including newly acquired locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation the company excludes closed stores from the calculation comparable store sales are not adjusted for store expansions due to extensive full and partial store closures resulting from the covid19 pandemic comparable store sales are not reported for fiscal year ended july 2 2022 as the company does not believe this metric is currently meaningful to the readers of its financial statements for this period 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s internal management reporting excluded these items in addition the human resources committee of the company’s board uses these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects these effects occur from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance 

by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

2966 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount under its 2027 senior notes and 2025 senior notes respectively in june 2017 the company issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 senior notes and 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 3000 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2022 at 99505 of par the 2022 senior notes the 2022 senior notes were fully redeemed as of july 2 2022 in march 2015 the company issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 senior notes furthermore the indentures for the 2032 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2025 senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the company’s ability to i create certain liens ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate or transfer sell or lease all or substantially all of the company’s assets as of july 2 2022 no known events of default have occurred refer to note 12 debt for further information on our existing debt instruments 

we believe that our revolving credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of july 2 2022 there were 14 financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility and term loans with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 14 we have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for among other things acquisition or integrationrelated costs our restructuring initiatives settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

management believes that cash flows from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines onhand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2023 and beyond there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all our ability to fund working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on future operating performance and cash flow this future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions which is uncertain as a result of covid19 and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond the companys control 

to improve our working capital efficiency starting in fiscal 2021 we made available to certain suppliers a voluntary supply chain finance “scf” program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the company to a global financial institution on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating we do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the scf program no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf program 

total capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs were 1616 million in fiscal 2022 as the company continues to prioritize investing in digital capabilities certain cloud computing implementation costs are recognized within prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we typically build inventory for the winter and holiday season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday season in fiscal 2022 due to the increased intransit times the company started to build inventory in the fourth fiscal quarter for the fiscal 2023 winter and holiday season 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including macroeconomic events such as covid19 or adverse weather conditions 

stock repurchase plan 

on november 11 2021 the company announced the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 100 billion of its outstanding common stock the 2021 share repurchase program on may 12 2022 the company announced the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 150 billion of its common stock the 2022 share repurchase program pursuant to this program purchases of the companys common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares these shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes in addition the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time as of july 2 2022 the company had 150 billion of additional shares available to be repurchased as authorized under the 2021 share repurchase program and 2022 share repurchase program refer to part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further information the company intends to repurchase approximately 7000 million worth of stock in fiscal 2023 all of which is remaining under its current authorization 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of july 2 2022 the companys contractual obligations are as follows 





1 mandatory transition tax payments represent our tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the tax legislation refer to note 15 income taxes for further information interest on outstanding debt includes fixed interest expenses for unsecured notes and variable interest expenses for the term loan the estimated interest expenses associated with our term loan is based on the current interest rate as of july 2 2022 refer to note 12 debt for further information 

we expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and if necessary through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 1011 million as of july 2 2022 as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever besides the firm commitments noted above the above table excludes other amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at july 2 2022 as these items will be paid within one year and certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit surety bonds and bank guarantees of 378 million as of july 2 2022 primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty leases insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing these letters of credit expire at various dates through calendar 2028 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers which may be at a point of time or over time control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services the amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved 

retail store and concession shopinshop revenues are recognized at the pointofsale when the customer obtains physical possession of the products digital revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and digital revenues are recorded net of estimated returns which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience payment is due at the point of sale 

the company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns discounts endofseason markdowns cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer the companys historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results 

the company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the companys trademarks these arrangements require licensees to pay a salesbased royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess salesbased royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved 

at july 2 2022 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

the company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels including ecommerce sites substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at july 2 2022 a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

upon acquisition the company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consists of brands customer relationships rightofuse assets and order backlog goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including brand intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multiperiod excess earnings method respectively with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 profitability trends continued to decline from those that were expected for the stuart weitzman brand the reduction in both cash from operations and future expected cash flows were exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a decline in sales driven by full and partial closures of a significant portion of our stores globally as a result of these macroeconomic conditions the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting in the need to perform a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the company’s stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible assets the assessment concluded that the fair values of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible asset as of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 did not exceed their respective carrying values accordingly in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2107 million related to the stuart weitzman reporting unit resulting in a full impairment during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company also recorded an impairment charge of 2670 million related to the stuart weitzman indefinitelived brand resulting in a full impairment in considering the excess of the fair value over its carrying value for all coach and kate spade reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangibles management did not perform an interim assessment for these reporting units in fiscal 2020 further the company determined there was no impairment during the fiscal 2020 annual impairment assessment 

based on the annual assessment in fiscal 2022 the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand as of the fiscal 2022 testing date exceeded their carrying values by approximately 50 and 90 respectively several factors could impact the kate spade brands ability to achieve expected future cash flows including the optimization of the store fleet productivity the success of international expansion strategies the impact of promotional activity continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the macroeconomic factors the reception of new collections in all channels and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2023 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in 

merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys or individuals achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2022 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination the company considers all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized the company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities the company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the companys results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ transactions denominated in foreign currencies to mitigate such risk certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts as of july 2 2022 and july 3 2021 forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 415 million and 614 million respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of july 2 2022

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

risks related to our business and our industry 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions are and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted a significant majority of the regions in which we operate disrupting operations consumer spending and global supply chains and creating significant disruption and volatility of financial markets the impacts of covid19 have and may continue to materially adversely impact our operations cash flow and liquidity in march 2020 the outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the world health organization national state and local governments have responded to the covid19 pandemic in a variety of ways including but not limited to by declaring states of emergency restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance ie social distancing requiring individuals to stay at home and in most cases ordering nonessential businesses to close or limit operations as a result the company had temporarily closed the majority of its directly operated stores globally for some period of time to help reduce the spread of covid19 during fiscal 2020 throughout fiscal year 2021 the vast majority of the company’s stores were opened although experienced reduce traffic from historical levels for either instore or curbside service and have continued to operate some store locations have however experienced temporary reclosures or operated under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulation during the course of fiscal year 2021 and into the beginning of fiscal year 2022 many of the company’s wholesale partners also experienced closure of their stores or operating restrictions during the fiscal year as required by government orders the company has noted that certain geographies have experienced increased infection rates due to new variants of covid19 resulting in a decline in store traffic in these regions the company currently expects that this trend will not have a material adverse impact on its financial results for fiscal 2022 however if such infections rates continue to rise resulting in further declines in store traffic the companys financial results may be negatively impacted from that which is currently expected in addition certain of the company’s supply chain partners particularly those in southeast asia have experienced temporary closures due to an increase in covid19 cases in the region which has and may continue to negatively impact the company’s supply chain operations 

the global covid19 pandemic is continuously evolving and the extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our results and our business  including unforeseen increased costs to our business  will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the ultimate duration severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus including the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants or treat its impact such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines among others while the full magnitude of the effects on our business continues to be difficult to predict the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations although the ultimate severity and impact of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain at this time and depends on future events outside of our control our business is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by several factors including but not limited to 

• we source and manufacture our products on a global scale and we have experienced and may continue to experience material temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain given the global reach of the covid19 pandemic travel restrictions closures or disruptions of business and facilities including manufacturing facilities and raw material providers unavailability of vaccines for our international employees or workers in our supply chain or social economic political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of our raw material suppliers or manufacturing partners this disruption to our supply chain may result in inventory not being available in a timely manner andor during the appropriate season and higher inbound freight costs all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

• the potential economic effects of the pandemic including a possible recession increased unemployment and decreased consumer credit availability may result in lower consumer confidence and decreased disposable income and discretionary spending levels which may lead to reduced sales of our products unfavorable economic conditions fears of becoming ill and sustained travel restrictions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which the company’s stores are located furthermore reduced discretionary spending may result in an excess of inventory throughout the industry which could lead to increased pressure on our gross margin in the near term if the company has to increase promotional activity above its normal levels to sell through its existing product 

• social distancing measures and general consumer behaviors due to the covid19 pandemic may continue to impact mall and store traffic even as stores return to normal operations which may have a further negative impact on our business furthermore declines in traffic beyond our current exceptions could result in additional impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

• we continue to sell products through our stores and through our ecommerce sites the majority of our fulfillment centers remain open and operational through the date of this report however such fulfillment centers may be forced to close or limit operations due to governmental mandates health and safety concerns or illness or absence of a substantial number of distribution center employees we may not be able to keep up with demand for our products because we have and may continue to experience delays in or increased costs for the shipment or delivery of our products due to capacity constraints shipping delays or port congestion 

the successful execution of our acceleration program is key to the longterm success of our business 

the company has implemented a strategic growth plan after undergoing a review of its business under the acceleration program the guiding principle of this multiyear growth agenda is to better meet the needs of each of its brands unique customers by i sharpening our focus on the customer ii leveraging data and leading with a digitalfirst mindset and iii transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization the company believes the successful execution of these priorities will fuel desire for the coach kate spade and stuart weitzman brands driving accelerated revenue growth higher gross margins and substantial operating leverage across tapestry’s portfolio 

the acceleration program reflects i actions to streamline the companys organization ii select store closures as the company optimizes its fleet including store closure costs incurred as the company exits certain regions in which it currently operates and iii professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the companys comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability 

the company believes that longterm growth and increased profitability can be realized through its strategic growth efforts over time however there is no assurance that we will be able to implement such efforts in accordance with our plans that such efforts will result in the intended or otherwise desirable outcomes or that such efforts even if successfully implemented will be effective in achieving longterm growth or increased profitability refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 7 restructuring activities for further information regarding the acceleration program further recent or future changes in our executive leadership team may have an adverse effect on our ability to implement or to achieve favorable results under the acceleration program andor result in further changes to our strategy 

if our execution of the initiatives under our acceleration program falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 414 of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states as of the end of fiscal year 2021 while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets including the potential impact of 1 new policies that may be implemented by the us or other jurisdictions particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or 2 impacts from the united kingdom “uk” leaving the european union “eu” commonly known as brexit and the agreement between the uk and the eu and countries outside the eu with respect to amongst other things tariffs

• changes to the uss participation in withdrawal out of renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the nonrenewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries tariff quotas and retaliatory tariffs trade sanctions new or onerous trade restrictions embargoes and other stringent government controls 

• changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products result in decreased international consumer demand or increase our supply costs in those markets with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates 

• compliance with laws relating to foreign operations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act and other global anticorruption laws which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials and other regulations and requirements 

• changes in tourist shopping patterns particularly that of the chinese consumer and as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• natural and other disasters

• changes in legal and regulatory requirements including but not limited to safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change and other environmental legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

• continued disruptions or delays in shipments whether due to port congestion logistics carrier disruption other shipping capacity constraints or other factors which has and may continue to result in significantly increased inbound freight costs 

• loss or disruption of key manufacturing or fulfillment sites or extended closure of such sites due to the covid19 pandemic or other unexpected factors 

• imposition of additional duties taxes and other charges or restrictions on imports or exports 

• unavailability or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 

• compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations 

• increases in the cost of labor fuel including volatility in the price of oil travel and transportation 

• compliance with our global business integrity program 

• compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our supplier code of conduct social auditing procedures and requirements and other applicable compliance policies 

• compliance with applicable laws and regulations including us laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of “conflict minerals” sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company’s products other laws and regulations regarding the sourcing of materials in the company’s products the fcpa uk bribery act and other global anticorruption laws as applicable and other us and international regulations and requirements 

• regulation or prohibition of the transaction of business with specific individuals or entities and their affiliates or goods manufactured in certain regions by any government or regulatory authority in the jurisdictions where we conduct business such as the listing of a person or entity as a specially designated national or blocked person by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and the issuance of withhold release orders by the us customs and border patrol 

• inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company’s costeffective sourcing model 

• product quality issues 

• political unrest including protests and other civil disruption 

• public health crises such as pandemic and epidemic diseases and other unforeseen outbreaks 

• natural disasters or other extreme weather events whether as a result of climate change or otherwise 

• acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control 

we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our supplier code of conduct and other compliance policies under our global business integrity program however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program documents including our global operating principles anticorruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwtapestrycom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor 

practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be materially impacted if our distribution and fulfillment centers face significant interruptions and operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of fulfillment and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers depending on the duration of these closures our results may be materially impacted while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and fulfillment center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or fulfillment for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business 

because our fulfillment centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a fulfillment center in jacksonville florida operated by tapestry to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established fulfillment centers in mainland china and the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate fulfillment centers through thirdparties in japan parts of greater china hong kong sar macao sar and taiwan singapore malaysia the us spain italy the uk canada australia and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations in addition increases in the company’s ecommerce sales has required additional fulfillment and fulfillment capacity subsequent to the 2021 fiscal yearend the company entered into a lease agreement for a multibrand fulfillment facility to be built in las vegas nevada in order to increase capacity and improve fulfillment capabilities as the company continues to focus on expanding its digital and ecommerce business any delay in the construction or our failure to execute our operational plans for this fulfillment center could result in the company not being able to meet customer demand for its products and could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 closures operating restrictions store capacity restrictions and changes in consumer shopping behavior as a result of the covid19 pandemic 2 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 3 surrounding tenants or vacancies 4 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 5 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 6 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our global omnichannel expansion efforts and our ability to execute our digital and ecommerce priorities 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design introduction of new products and maintaining an appropriate rationalization of our assortment our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to rationalize our assortment appropriately could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

our success and growth also depends on the continued development of our omnichannel presence for each of our brands globally leaning into global digital opportunities for each brand along with continued bricks and mortar expansion in select international regions notably mainland china with respect to international expansion our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets either through bricks and mortar stores or digital channels have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor privacy transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further expanding in certain markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient 

revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm we may also have to compete for talent in international regions as we expand our omnichannel presence 

consequently if our global omnichannel expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

a key strategy of our acceleration program is to leverage data and lead with a digitalfirst mindset including offering satisfying customer experiences across our ecommerce and social channels and meeting the needs of our customers who are engaging with our brands digitally we aim to provide a seamless omnichannel experience to our customers regardless of whether they are shopping in stores or engaging with our brands through digital technology such as computers mobile phones tablets or other devices this requires investment in new technologies and reliance on third party digital partners over which we may have limited control additionally our ability to provide timely delivery of ecommerce purchases is dependent on the capacity and operations of our owned and third party operated fulfillment facilities see “ our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities” for additional risks related to our distribution and fulfillment networks if we are unable to effectively execute our ecommerce and digital strategies and provide reliable experiences for our customers across all channels our reputation and ability to compete with other brands could suffer which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have experienced numerous changes to our senior leadership team there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or that we will be able to identify and attract suitable successors for these individuals the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the direct or indirect consequences of results thereof or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals or the loss of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

we must also attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified retail and fulfillment center employees historically competition for talent in these positions has been intense and turnover is generally high both of which have been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic if we are unable to attract and retain such employees with the necessary skills and experience we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy historically has been acquisitions although acquisitions are not currently contemplated in the companys near term strategy our management team has and in the future will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition however there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

• failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets 

• delays unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets 

• higher than expected costs lower than expected cost savings or synergies andor a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties 

• difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations 

• diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations 

• the impact on our or an acquired business’ internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

• unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations 

• unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators 

• retaining key customers suppliers and employees 

• retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals licenses and permits 

• operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business 

• consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees 

• assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence and 

• other unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities 

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made during fiscal 2020 the fair value of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible asset did not exceed the respective carrying values resulting in goodwill impairment charges of 2107 million and indefinitelived brand impairment charges of 2670 million we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products or demand for our products are impacted by an unforeseen factor such as the covid19 pandemic we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on donation markdowns promotional sales or destruction to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

tapestry inc is a new yorkbased house of modern luxury lifestyle brands our global house of brands unites the magic of coach kate spade new york and stuart weitzman each of our brands are unique and independent while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies any misstep in product quality or design executive leadership customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences 

and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted 

the shift towards digital engagement became increasingly important during the covid19 pandemic with increased use of social media platforms by our brand representatives influencers and our employees actions taken by our partners on social media that do not show our brands in a manner consistent with our desired image or that are damaging to such partner’s reputation whether or not through our brand social media platforms could harm our brand reputation and materially impact our business 

our success also depends in part on our and our executive leadership teams ability to execute on our plans and strategies even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry 

our wholesale business comprised approximately 10 of total net sales for fiscal 2021 the retail industry including wholesale customers has experienced financial difficulty leading to consolidations reorganizations restructuring bankruptcies and ownership changes in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in reduced operations or the closure temporarily or permanently of many of our wholesale partners this is likely to continue and could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of wholesale stores that carry our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

our brands currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for certain products in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

a delay disruption in failure of or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations including management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our brands’ stores our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems 

the company embarked on a multiyear erp implementation in fiscal 2017 which was completed in fiscal 2020 implementing new systems carries substantial risk including failure to operate as designed failure to properly integrate with other systems potential loss of confidential and personal information cost overruns implementation delays and disruption of operations thirdparty vendors are also relied upon to design program maintain and service our erp systems any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business in addition any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our new erp systems could lead to the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands stores or customers in a timely manner andor cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed defective corrupted inadequate or inaccessible furthermore failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security and personal data breaches system upgrades or migration of these services as well as employee and consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations individually or in accumulation could have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues including those associated with climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change including through disruption to our supply chain potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and pricing of raw materials increased frequency and intensity of weather events storms and floods due to climate change could also lead to more frequent store closures andor lost sales as customers prioritize basic needs there is also increased focus from our stakeholders including consumers employees and investors on corporate responsibility matters although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 corporate responsibility goals there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our company and brands and negatively impact our operations even if we are able to achieve our 2025 corporate responsibility goals our business will continue to remain subject to risks associated with climate change 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under noncancelable leases many of which have historically had initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option in certain cases as we have done in the past we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize consolidate reposition relocate or close some of our real estate locations in such cases we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term for example in connection with the impact of the covid19 pandemic and our acceleration program we have negotiated with some landlords on certain store exits in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally due to the volatile economic environment it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases this may impact our ability to manage the profitability of our store locations or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets if market values decline any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to global economic conditions and legal and regulatory matters 

we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products 

most of our imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products to maximize opportunities we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and as a result we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our crossborder activity for example we have historically received benefits from dutyfree imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the us generalized system of preferences gsp program the gsp program expired on december 31 2020 resulting in additional duties and negatively impacting gross margin the company is expecting the gsp program to be renewed and made retroactive however if this does not occur it will continue to have a negative impact on our expected results additionally we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities including related to us customs and border protection cbp withhold release orders the imposition of taxes duties and quotas the withdrawal from or material modification to trade agreements andor if cbp detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition since fiscal 2019 the us and china have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs however while the us has participated in multinational negotiations on trade agreements and duty rates there continues to be a possibility of increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us from other countries which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations as a result 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a personal data or security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers stores and vendors the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital and local marketing efforts data analytics collection use and retention of customer data employee vendor and partner information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space since the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the majority of our corporate employees and independent contractors have worked remotely for some time and many continue to do so which has increased our dependence on digital technology during this period the possibility of a successful cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable and adequate security measures and data protection we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a personal data or security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random personal data or security breaches acts of vandalism computer malware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events further like other companies in the retail industry during the ordinary course of business we and our vendors have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks of varying degrees and types including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that cyberattacks will not have a material impact in the future 

awareness and sensitivity to personal data breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees vendors and investors we have been incurring and expect that we will continue to incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with current and new international federal and state laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential and personal information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation gdpr in the eu and the california consumer privacy act ccpa and the california privacy rights act cpra the virginia consumer data protection act vcdpa and colorado privacy act cpa in the usa as well as increased cyber security and privacy protection costs such as organizational changes covid19 employee and visitor health checks deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees engaging third party experts and consultants we may also experience loss of revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breach containment and notification costs to supervisory 

authorities and the affected data subjects and increased litigation as a result of cyber security or personal data breaches while we carry cyber liability insurance such insurance may not cover us with respect to any or all claims or costs associated with such a breach 

in addition we have ecommerce sites in certain countries throughout the world including the us canada japan mainland china several throughout europe australia and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally tapestry has informational websites in various countries given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer databases and iv ability to email or otherwise keep in contact with our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security and personal data breaches email blocking lists computer malware or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems and applications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels tax rates unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs pandemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and natural disasters fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production supply chain activity commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

unfavorable economic conditions as well as travel restrictions and potential changes in consumer behavior resulting from the covid19 pandemic may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly effective tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

current or future tax legislation may impact our tax structure and effective tax rates on december 22 2017 “hr1” formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax legislation” was signed into law the tax legislation which became effective on january 1 2018 significantly revised the us tax code and required the company to estimate the impact on its financial results on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was signed into law in response to the covid19 pandemic the cares act contains numerous tax provisions such as refundable payroll tax credits deferral of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes net operating loss carrybacks modifications to net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property on december 27 2020 the consolidated appropriations act 2021 covid19 stimulus package was signed into law which contained enhancements to certain tax credits enacted under the cares act the tax legislation and the cares act and the covid19 stimulus package require the company to make significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation of the law and in the calculation of the provision for taxes however additional guidance may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” the department of the treasury or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law which may result in a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions in addition to the enacted legislation there continues to be meaningful discussion around proposed legislative changes including those recently announced by the biden administration and long standing discussions within the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the biden administration has proposed amongst other things increasing the us federal tax rate from 21 to 28 broadening the us tax base to include additional income from international operations and limiting us deductions where certain conditions exist the oecd is separately focused on a number of potential changes including imposing a global minimum tax and redistributing profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions it is 

unclear at this time which of these proposals if any may be enacted and how these various provisions will interact on a local country and global scale and whether one or more of these provisions may result in double taxation if enacted as currently proposed these provisions could have a material adverse impact on our tax rate cash flow and financial results 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements we hedge certain cross currency intercompany inventory transactions and foreign currency balance sheet exposures as well as the company’s cross currency intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of july 3 2021 our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 16 billion we repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility during fiscal year 2021 and have the capacity to borrow 900 million of additional indebtedness under the facility which may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets on may 19 2020 we entered into an amendment to our credit facility which requires us to maintain available liquidity of 700 million through october 2 2021 and waives compliance with our leverage ratio covenant through the date our compliance certificate is delivered for the fiscal quarter ended july 3 2021 the “covenant relief period” during the covenant relief period the company is subject to certain additional requirements and restrictions refer to note 13 debt for a summary of these terms and additional information on the terms of our revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes 

the consequences and limitations under our credit agreement and the amendment thereto and our other outstanding indebtedness could impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions in addition a prolonged disruption in our business may impact our ability to satisfy the available liquidity requirement under the amendment to our credit facility and beyond the term of the covenant relief period the leverage ratio covenant noncompliance with these terms would constitute an event of default under our credit facility which may result in acceleration of payment to the lenders in the event of an acceleration of payment to the lenders this would result in a cross default of the company’s senior notes causing the company’s outstanding borrowings to also become due and payable on demand 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control including the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on 

our business we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

as a result of having operations outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that when possible it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales operating income net interest expense earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections we did not provide detailed guidance in our earnings reports for the second half of fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of covid19 on our business we have resumed providing guidance for fiscal year 2022 and while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to provide guidance going forward or to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases on march 26 2020 we announced we were suspending our quarterly dividend payment effective beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and stock repurchase program due to the impact of covid19 pandemic subsequent to the fiscal 2021 year end the company’s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the companys shareholder return program and declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per common share payable on september 27 2021 the company also intends to repurchase approximately 5000 million worth of stock in fiscal 2022 of which 6000 million is remaining under its current authorization investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at a certain time and at certain levels and  or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors’ expectations refer to “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be negatively impacted ” for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be negatively impacted 

on march 26 2020 the company announced that due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic tapestry’s quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 along with the stock repurchase program would be suspended subsequent to the fiscal 2021 year end the company’s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the companys shareholder return program and declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per common share payable on september 27 2021 the company also intends to repurchase approximately 5000 million worth of stock in fiscal 2022 of which 6000 million is remaining under its current authorization the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases or conduct either program at expected levels after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of giving of notice by the stockholder pursuant to the companys bylaws and at the time of the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including mergers consolidations share exchanges or in circumstances specified in the statute asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities between the company and any interested stockholder generally defined as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 

our bylaws designate the circuit court for baltimore city maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions including derivative actions which could limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers other employees or the companys stockholders and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for a any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company b any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the company to the company or to the stockholders of the company c any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company arising pursuant to any provision of the maryland general corporation law the charter or the bylaws of the company or d any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be the circuit court for baltimore city maryland or if that court does not have jurisdiction the united states district court for the district of maryland baltimore division this exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under maryland state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction 

although we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of maryland law for the specified types of actions and proceedings this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company and its directors officers or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims

current trends and outlook 

the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending consumer preferences macroeconomic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies 

the disruptions related to covid19 have materially adversely impacted our operations cash flow and liquidity the virus has impacted regions all around the world resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national state and local authorities these requirements have resulted in closures of our directly operated stores and locations of our wholesale partners globally causing a significant reduction in sales starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the vast majority of the companys stores reopened for either instore or curbside service and have continued to operate since then some store locations have experienced temporary reclosures or are operating under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulation and other stores may be required to close again for an extended period of time due to the possibility of a resurgence of increased infections the company has noted that certain geographies have experienced increased infection rates due to new variants of covid19 resulting in a decline in store traffic in these regions the company currently expects that this trend will not have a material adverse impact on its financial results for fiscal 2022 however if such infections rates continue to rise resulting in further declines in store traffic the companys financial results may be negatively impacted from that which is currently expected furthermore covid19 has and may continue to cause disruptions in the company’s supply chain within our fulfillment centers and logistics providers and has resulted in temporary closures in our thirdparty manufacturers the company exports a significant amount of its products from southeast asia which has and continues to experience increased rates of covid19 

the company has been experiencing other global logistics challenges such as delays as a result of port congestion vessel availability and container shortages for imported products that are expected to persist in fiscal 2022 which will result in the company using air freight with greater frequency than in the past in addition the company has recently incurred higher freight costs as rates for ocean and air shipments have significantly increased from those experienced in the beginning of fiscal 2021 

several organizations that monitor the world’s economy including the international monetary fund observed that the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has negatively shocked the global economy recent economic data forecasts a return to global growth for the remainder of calendar 2021 and 2022 projected growth is contingent on anticipated legislation of additional fiscal support and improved health metrics moreover there are factors that may hinder a global economic rebound including expected inflationary pressures in calendar 2022 additionally there are still lingering uncertainties due to covid19 that may limit growth rates and progress such as expected vaccine rollouts and mutations of the virus thus the revisions to estimated growth are heavily dependent on continued strong multilateral cooperation to bring the pandemic under control including funding and support from local policymakers to make strategic investments that aid economic activity 

certain markets around the world have been faced with labor shortages which have not impacted the companys operations to date if these trends continue or worsen it could potentially affect the companys ability to attract and retain employees for its retail and fulfillment locations in the future 

furthermore currency volatility political instability and potential changes to trade agreements or duty rates may contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment or adversely impact our business since fiscal 2019 the us and china have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs however while the us has participated in multinational negotiations on trade agreements and duty rates there continues to be a possibility of increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us from other countries 

furthermore certain tax legislation contemplated by the biden administration including increasing the us corporate tax rate and by the organization for economic cooperation and development would have an adverse impact on our tax rate and financial results if passed as currently communicated 

additional macroeconomic impacts include but are not limited to the united kingdom uk voting to leave the european union eu commonly known as brexit the uk officially terminated its membership of the eu on january 31 2020 under the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the uk and eu and concluded the transition phase on december 31 2020 the company does not expect brexit to materially impact our business 

as part of our efforts to improve our working capital efficiency we have worked with certain suppliers to revisit terms and conditions including the extension of payment terms as an alternative to our payment terms available to certain suppliers is a voluntary supply chain finance “scf” program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the company to a global financial institution on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating we do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the scf program no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf program 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands 

furthermore refer to part i item 1  business for additional discussion on our expected store openings and closures within each of our segments for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations refer to part i item 1a  risk factors

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share reflect certain items including the impact of the cares act tax impact in fiscal 2021 impairment costs and acceleration program costs in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and erp implementation and organizationrelated and integration charges in fiscal 2020 as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

furthermore the company has disclosed the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 on net sales operating income and earnings per diluted share results 

the company has historically reported comparable store sales which reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from ecommerce sites the company excludes new stores including newly acquired locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation the company excludes closed stores from the calculation comparable store sales are not adjusted for store expansions due to extensive full and partial store closures resulting from the covid19 pandemic comparable store sales are not reported for fiscal year ended july 3 2021 as the company does not believe this metric is currently meaningful to the readers of its financial statements for this period 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s internal management reporting excluded these items in addition the human resources committee of the company’s board uses these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects these effects occur from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance 

by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

3 in march 2015 the company issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 4250 senior unsecured notes due april 1 2025 at 99445 of par the 2025 senior notes on june 20 2017 the company issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 3000 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2022 at 99505 of par the 2022 senior notes and 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2027 at 99858 of par the 2027 senior notes the indentures for the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the companys ability to i create certain liens ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge or consolidate or transfer sell or lease all or substantially all of the companys assets as of 

july 3 2021 no known events of default have occurred refer to note 13 debt for further information on our existing debt instruments 

we believe that our revolving credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of july 3 2021 there were 12 financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 14 we have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for among other things acquisition or integrationrelated costs our restructuring initiatives settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

management believes that cash flows from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines onhand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2021 and beyond there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all our ability to fund working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on future operating performance and cash flow this future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions which is uncertain as a result of covid19 and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond the companys control the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 220 million in fiscal 2022 as the company continues to prioritize investing in digital capabilities 

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events including pandemics such as covid19 

stock repurchase plan 

on may 9 2019 the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase up to 100 billion of shares of its outstanding common stock pursuant to this program purchases of the companys common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares these shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes in addition the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time as of july 3 2021 the company has 6000 million of additional shares available to be repurchased as authorized under the plan amendment no 1 to the revolving credit facility contains negative covenants that limit the ability of the company to among other things engage in share buybacks during the covenant relief period refer to part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further information subsequent to the fiscal 2021 year end the company’s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the companys shareholder return program and declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per common share payable on september 27 2021 the company also intends to repurchase approximately 5000 million worth of stock in fiscal 2022 of which 6000 million is remaining under its current authorization 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of july 3 2021 the companys contractual obligations are as follows 





1 mandatory transition tax payments represent our tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the tax legislation refer to note 16 income taxes for further information 

excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 1131 million as of july 3 2021 as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at july 3 2021 as these items will be paid within one year and certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit surety bonds and bank guarantees of 405 million as of july 3 2021 primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty leases insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2028 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 14 commitments and contingencies for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers which may be at a point of time or over time control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services the amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved 

retail store and concession shopinshop revenues are recognized at the pointofsale when the customer obtains physical possession of the products digital revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and digital revenues are recorded net of estimated returns which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience payment is due at the point of sale 

the company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns discounts endofseason markdowns cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer the companys historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results 

the company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the companys trademarks these arrangements require licensees to pay a salesbased royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess salesbased royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved 

at july 3 2021 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

the company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels including ecommerce sites substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at july 3 2021 a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items furthermore the company may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations if goodwill is identified based upon the valuation of an acquired business the goodwill is assigned to the 

reporting units which will benefit from the synergies that result from the business combination and reported within the segment that such reporting units comprise refer to note 4 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

upon acquisition the company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consists of brands customer relationships rightofuse assets and order backlog goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including brand intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multiperiod excess earnings method respectively with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2019 during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 profitability trends continued to decline from those that were expected for the stuart weitzman brand the reduction in both cash from operations and future expected cash flows were exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a decline in sales driven by full and partial closures of a significant portion of our stores globally as a result of these macroeconomic conditions the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting in the need to perform a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the company’s stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible assets the assessment concluded that the fair values of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible asset as of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 did not exceed their respective carrying values accordingly in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2107 million related to the stuart weitzman reporting unit resulting in a full impairment during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company also recorded an impairment charge of 2670 million related to the stuart weitzman indefinitelived brand resulting in a full impairment in considering the excess of the fair value over its carrying value for all coach and kate spade reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangibles management did not perform an interim assessment for these reporting units further the company determined there was no impairment during the fiscal 2020 annual impairment assessment 

based on the annual assessment in fiscal 2021 the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand as of the fiscal 2021 testing date exceeded their carrying values by approximately 41 and 77 respectively several factors could impact the kate spade brands ability to achieve expected future cash flows including continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the covid19 pandemic the reception of new collections in all channels the success of international expansion strategies the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2022 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys or individuals achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2021 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination the company considers all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized the company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities the company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the companys results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ transactions denominated in foreign currencies to mitigate such risk certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts as of july 3 2021 and june 27 2020 forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 614 million and 5862 million respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of july 3 2021 

the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans and payables this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the chinese renminbi the british pound sterling and the euro to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company enters into forward currency contracts as of july 3 2021 and june 27 2020 the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were 2482 million and 769 million respectively 

the fair value of outstanding forward currency contracts included in current assets at july 3 2021 and june 27 2020 was 03 million and 29 million respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at july 3 2021 and june 27 2020 was 12 million and 17 million respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of july 3 2021 a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values

our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at the company’s option either a an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 or b a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid as defined in the credit agreement based on the ratio of a consolidated debt plus operating lease liability to b consolidated ebitdar a hypothetical 10 change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2021 furthermore a prolonged disruption on our business resulting from the covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to satisfy the terms of our revolving credit facility including our liquidity covenant 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes at july 3 2021 the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately 652 million 407 million and 

659 million respectively at june 27 2020 the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately 577 million 393 million and 565 million respectively these fair values are based on external pricing data including available quoted market prices of these instruments and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency among other factors and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody’s or sp or a substitute rating agency as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7 2017 downgrades or downgrades and subsequently upgrades the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series

before partnering with a new vendor the company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a recurring basis we believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the company’s integrity standards 

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashionoriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards which are an integral part of our brands identity one of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials we have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities 

we maintain strong oversight of the supply chain process for each of our brands from design through manufacture we are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in vietnam mainland china the philippines cambodia and spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions are and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted a significant majority of the regions in which we operate disrupting operations consumer spending and global supply chains and creating significant disruption and volatility of financial markets the impacts of covid19 have and may continue to materially adversely impact our operations cash flow and liquidity in march 2020 the outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the world health organization national state and local governments have responded to the covid19 pandemic in a variety of ways including but not limited to by declaring states of emergency restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance ie social distancing requiring individuals to stay at home and in most cases ordering nonessential businesses to close or limit operations the company had temporarily closed the majority of its directly operated stores globally for some period of time to help reduce the spread of covid19 as of the end of the fiscal year the vast majority of the company’s stores had been reopened for either instore or curbside service many of the company’s wholesale partners also closed their bricks and mortar stores as required by government orders during the third and fourth fiscal quarter 

the global covid19 pandemic is continuing to evolve rapidly and the extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our results and our business  including unforeseen increased costs to our business  will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the ultimate duration severity and sustained geographic spread of the virus such as the possibility of a second wave of increased infections and the success of actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others while the full magnitude of the effects on our business is difficult to predict at this time the covid19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations although the ultimate severity and impact of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain at this time and depends on future events outside of our control our business is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by several factors including but not limited to 



 the successful execution of our acceleration program is key to the longterm success of our business 

the company is undergoing a review of its business under the acceleration program the guiding principle of this multiyear growth agenda is to better meet the needs of each of its brands unique customers by i sharpening our focus on the customer ii leveraging data and leading with a digitalfirst mindset and iii transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization the company believes the successful execution of these priorities will fuel desire for the coach kate spade and stuart weitzman brands driving accelerated revenue growth higher gross margins and substantial operating leverage across tapestry’s portfolio 

the acceleration program reflects i actions to streamline the companys organization ii select store closures as the company optimizes its fleet including store closure costs incurred as the company exits certain regions in which it currently operates and iii professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the companys comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability 

the company believes that longterm growth and increased profitability can be realized through its strategic growth efforts over time however there is no assurance that we will be able to implement such efforts in accordance with our plans that such efforts will result in the intended or otherwise desirable outcomes or that such efforts even if successfully implemented will be effective in achieving longterm growth or increased profitability refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 7 restructuring activities for further information regarding the acceleration program further recent or future changes in our executive leadership team may have an adverse effect on our ability to implement or to achieve favorable results under the acceleration program andor result in further changes to our strategy 

if our execution of the initiatives under our acceleration program falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels tax rates unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs pandemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and natural disasters fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

unfavorable economic conditions as well as travel restrictions and potential changes in consumer behavior resulting from the covid19 pandemic may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 428 of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

 our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 



 we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our supplier code of conduct and other compliance policies under our global business integrity program however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program documents including our global operating principles anticorruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwtapestrycom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by tapestry to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan parts of greater china hong kong sar macao sar and taiwan singapore malaysia the us spain italy the uk canada australia and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under noncancelable leases which have historically had initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option in certain cases as we have done in the past we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize consolidate reposition relocate or close some of our real estate locations in such cases we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term for example in connection with the impact of the covid19 pandemic and our acceleration program we are in active negotiations with our landlords on certain store exits in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally due to the volatile economic environment it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases this may impact our ability to manage the 

profitability of our store locations or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets if market values decline any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 closures operating restrictions and changes in consumer shopping behavior as a result of the covid19 pandemic 2 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 3 surrounding tenants or vacancies 4 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 5 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 6 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our global omnichannel expansion efforts 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design introduction of new products and maintaining an appropriate rationalization of our assortment our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to rationalize our assortment appropriately could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

our success and growth also depends on the continued development of our omnichannel presence for each of our brands globally leaning into global digital opportunities for each brand along with continued bricks and mortar expansion in select international regions notably mainland china our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets either through bricks and mortar stores or digital channels have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor privacy transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further expanding in certain markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm we may also have to compete for talent in international regions as we expand our omnichannel presence 

consequently if our global omnichannel expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space since the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the majority of our corporate employees and contractors have worked remotely for some time and many continue to do so which has increased our dependence on digital technology during this period the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer malware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with current and new state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential and personal information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the eu and the california consumer privacy act in california usa as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes covid19 employee and visitor health checks deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breach containment and notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we have ecommerce sites in certain countries throughout the world including the us canada japan mainland china several throughout europe australia and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally tapestry has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer malware or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products 

most of our imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products to maximize opportunities we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and as a result we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our crossborder activity in may 2019 the united states increased the tariff rate from 10 to 25 on 200 billion of imports of select product categories into the us from china on august 1 2019 the trump administration announced that the us plans to implement an additional tariff of 10 on the remaining 300 billion of products imported into the us from china on september 1 2019 however in january 2020 the us and china reached a phase one trade deal which reduced tariffs to 75 on some of the 300 billion of select imports without imposing any retaliatory tariffs on the rest of the products while the trade deal remains effective there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored by either party which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations as a result 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes 

in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products or demand for our products are impacted by an unforeseen factor such as the covid19 pandemic we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

tapestry inc is a new yorkbased house of modern luxury lifestyle brands our company and our brands are founded upon a consumerled view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability any misstep in product quality or design executive leadership customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our and our executive leadership teams ability to execute on our plans and strategies even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of june 27 2020  our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 23 billion we also have the capacity to borrow an additional 200 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility which may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets on may 19 2020 we entered into an amendment to our credit facility which requires us to maintain available liquidity of 700 million through october 2 2021 and waives compliance with our leverage ratio covenant through the date our compliance certificate is delivered for the fiscal quarter ending july 3 2021 the “covenant relief period” the amendment also provides that if any two of tapestry’s three credit ratings are noninvestment grade during the covenant relief period tapestry’s material domestic subsidiaries will guarantee the credit facility and be subject to liens on accounts receivable inventory and intellectual property in each case subject to customary exceptions in addition to our standard covenants the amendment also contains limitations on our ability to engage in share buybacks or issue cash dividends during the covenant relief period amongst other restrictions an increased interest rate will also be applicable during the covenant relief period when the company’s gross leverage ratio exceeds 40 to 10 in addition it is possible that the interest rate payable on our 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody’s or sp or a substitute rating agency downgrades or downgrades and subsequently upgrades the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series refer to note 13 debt for additional information on the terms of our revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes 

the consequences and limitations under our credit agreement and the amendment thereto and our other outstanding indebtedness could impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions in addition a prolonged disruption in our business may impact our ability to satisfy the available liquidity requirement under the amendment to our credit facility and beyond the term of the covenant relief period the leverage ratio covenant noncompliance with these terms would constitute an event of default under our credit facility which may result in acceleration of payment to the lenders in the event of an acceleration of payment to the lenders this would result in a cross default of the company’s senior notes causing the company’s outstanding borrowings to also become due and payable on demand 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control including the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have experienced numerous changes to our senior leadership team there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or that we will be able to identify and attract suitable successors for these individuals the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the direct or indirect consequences of results thereof or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals or the loss of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy historically has been acquisitions such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade  company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 although acquisitions are not currently contemplated in the companys near term strategy our management team has and in the future will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition however there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 



 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made during fiscal 2020 the fair value of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible asset did not exceed the respective carrying values resulting in goodwill impairment charges of 2107 million and indefinitelived brand impairment charges of 2670 million we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements we hedge our cross currency intercompany inventory transactions as well as the company’s cross currency intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

as a result of having operations outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that when possible it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales operating income net interest expense earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections we did not provide guidance in our earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of covid19 on our business we have decided to continue to not provide guidance at this time and we do not have any responsibility to do so going forward or to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases on march 26 2020 we announced we were suspending our quarterly dividend payment effective beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and stock repurchase program due to the impact of covid19 pandemic investors may have an expectation that we will resume our dividend at a certain time and at certain levels and  or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs 

from investors’ expectations refer to “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry 

our wholesale business comprised approximately 9 of total net sales for fiscal 2020 the retail industry including wholesale customers has experienced financial difficulty leading to consolidations reorganizations restructuring bankruptcies and ownership changes in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in reduced operations or the closure temporarily or permanently of many of our wholesale partners this is likely to continue and could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of wholesale stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a delay disruption in failure of or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations including management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our brands’ stores our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems 

the company embarked on a multiyear erp implementation in fiscal 2017 which was completed in fiscal 2020 implementing new systems carries substantial risk including failure to operate as designed failure to properly integrate with other systems potential loss of data or information cost overruns implementation delays and disruption of operations thirdparty vendors are also relied upon to design program maintain and service our erp systems any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business in addition any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our new erp systems could lead to the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands stores or customers in a timely manner andor cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed defective corrupted inadequate or inaccessible furthermore failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations individually or in accumulation could have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

current or future tax legislation may impact our tax structure and effective tax rates on december 22 2017 “hr1” formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax legislation” was signed into law the tax legislation which became effective on january 1 2018 significantly revised the us tax code and required the company to estimate the impact of the tax legislation for fiscal year 2019 on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was signed into law in response to the covid19 pandemic the cares act contains numerous income tax provisions such as refundable payroll tax credits deferral of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes net operating loss carrybacks modifications to net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property the tax legislation and the cares act require the company to make significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation of the law and in the calculation of the provision for income taxes however additional guidance may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” the department of the treasury or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law which may result in a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions 

the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues including those associated with climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change including through disruption to our supply chain potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and pricing of raw materials increased frequency and intensity of weather events storms and floods due to climate change could also lead to more frequent store closures andor lost sales as customers prioritize basic needs there is also increased focus from our stakeholders including consumers employees and investors on corporate responsibility matters although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 corporate responsibility goals there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our company and brands and negatively impact our operations even if we are able to achieve our 2025 corporate responsibility goals our business will continue to remain subject to risks associated with climate change 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

our brands currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for certain products refer to item 1  “ business  licensing ” for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

we have decided to suspend our quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program there can be no assurance if when and at what level our board of directors will authorize dividend payments or stock repurchases in the future 

on march 26 2020 the company announced that due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic tapestry’s quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 along with the stock repurchase program would be suspended while our board of directors intends to authorize dividends over the longterm and will reevaluate when appropriate there can be no assurance if when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments the company is restricted from declaring cash dividends or repurchasing shares under the negative covenants associated with amendment no 1 to the revolving credit facility during the covenant relief period the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a 

portion of our cash flow our ability to begin to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases in the future will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases or conduct either program at expected levels after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of giving of notice by the stockholder pursuant to the companys bylaws and at the time of the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including mergers consolidations share exchanges or in circumstances specified in the statute asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities between the company and any interested stockholder generally defined as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder

 recent developments

current trends and outlook 

the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending consumer preferences macroeconomic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies 

as previously noted covid19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 the virus has impacted regions all around the world resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national state and local authorities these requirements have resulted in full and partial store closures globally causing a significant reduction in sales starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the vast majority of the companys stores have reopened for either instore or curbside service as of the end of the fiscal year stores may be required to close again for an extended period of time due to the possibility of a second wave of increased infections covid19 may also cause disruptions in the company’s supply chain resulting in facility closures labor instability potential inability to source raw materials and disrupted operating procedures in attempts to curb the spread of covid19 within our thirdparty manufacturers distribution centers and other vendors the company’s ecommerce sites continue to operate subject to the local guidance related to covid19 surrounding our distribution centers 

the disruptions related to covid19 have materially adversely impacted our operations cash flow and liquidity there is uncertainty around the duration of these disruptions and the possibility of other effects on the business we will continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation pertaining to the covid19 outbreak including guidance from international and domestic authorities in these circumstances the company will need to make adjustments to our operating plan refer to part i item 1a “risk factors” for further information 

several organizations that monitor the world’s economy including the international monetary fund observed that global expansion has declined significantly in the last year and the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has negatively shocked the global economy contributing to further anticipated declines for the remainder of calendar 2020 these organizations expect recovery to be more gradual than initially anticipated based on the economic activity displayed by economies with declining infection rates economic activity has been marked by persistent social distancing and declines in productivity as businesses struggle to ramp up operations in response to risks and regulations related to covid19 for economies that struggle with infection control the negative impacts will be amplified due to lengthier lockdown provisions while intensifying uncertainty surrounds future economic growth multilateral cooperation and support from local policymakers is pivotal in shaping the economic outlook 

furthermore currency volatility political instability and potential changes to trade agreements may contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment during fiscal 2020 hong kong sar china has been the subject of worsening political unrest as demonstrated through ongoing public demonstrations and protests which has impacted and is expected to continue to impact our business in addition during fiscal 2019 and continuing into fiscal 2020 the trump administration and china have both imposed new tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country continued increases in trade tensions could impact the companys ability to grow its business with the chinese consumer globally 

additional macroeconomic impacts include but are not limited to the united kingdom uk voting to leave the european union eu commonly known as brexit on march 29 2017 the uk triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting a 2 year negotiation period with the eu which was subsequently extended to january 31 2020 the uk officially terminated its membership of the eu on january 31 2020 under the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the uk and eu and has now entered into a transition phase until december 31 2020 during the transition phase the uk will generally continue operating as if it were still a member of the eu trade talks between the eu and uk to determine their future relationship are still underway the uk passed on the opportunity to extend the transition phase beyond december 31 2020 and as such if a trade deal is not reached by december 31 2020 the uk can expect checks and tariffs on products going to and coming from the eu beginning on january 1 2021 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share reflect certain items including the impact of the impairment charges and acceleration program costs in fiscal 2020 erp implementation and organizationrelated and integration charges in fiscal 2020 and 2019 and the impact of tax legislation in fiscal 2019 as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

the company has historically reported comparable store sales which reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet the company excludes new stores including newly acquired locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation the company excludes closed stores from the calculation comparable store sales are not adjusted for store expansions due to extensive full and partial store closures resulting from the covid19 pandemic comparable store sales are not reported for fiscal year ended june 27 2020 as the company does not believe this metric is currently meaningful to the readers of its financial statements for this period 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s internal management reporting excluded these items in addition the human resources committee of the company’s board uses these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects these effects occur from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance 

by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for among other things acquisition or integrationrelated costs our restructuring initiatives settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

management believes that cash flows from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines onhand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2021 and beyond there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all our ability to fund working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on future operating performance and cash flow this future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions which is uncertain as a result of covid19 and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond the companys control the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 150 million in fiscal 2021 

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events including pandemics such as covid19 

share repurchase plan 

on may 9 2019 the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase up to 100 billion of shares of its outstanding common stock pursuant to this program purchases of the companys common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares these shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes in addition the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time during fiscal 2020 the company repurchased 3000 million of common stock as of june 27 2020  the company has the authorization to repurchase up to 6000 million of additional shares under the plan amendment no 1 to the revolving credit facility contains negative covenants that limit the ability of the company to among other things engage in share buybacks during the covenant relief period refer to part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further information 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of june 27 2020  the companys contractual obligations are as follows 





 excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 773 million as of june 27 2020  as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 27 2020 as these items will be paid within one year and certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit surety bonds and bank guarantees of 333 million as of june 27 2020  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty leases insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2039 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 14 commitments and contingencies for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers which may be at a point of time or over time control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services the amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved 

retail store and concession shopinshop revenues are recognized at the pointofsale when the customer obtains physical possession of the products internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and internet revenues are recorded net of estimated returns which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience payment is due at the point of sale 

the company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns discounts endofseason markdowns cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer the companys historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results 

the company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the companys trademarks these arrangements require licensees to pay a salesbased royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess salesbased royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved 

at june 27 2020  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

the company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels including ecommerce sites substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at june 27 2020  a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items furthermore the company may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations if goodwill is identified based upon the valuation of an acquired business the goodwill is assigned to the reporting units which will benefit from the synergies that result from the business combination and reported within the segment that such reporting units comprise refer to note 4 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

upon acquisition the company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consists of brands customer relationships rightofuse assets and order backlog goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including brand intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multiperiod excess earnings method respectively with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018  during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 profitability trends continued to decline from those that were expected for the stuart weitzman brand the reduction in both cash from operations and future expected cash flows were exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a decline in sales driven by full and partial closures of a significant portion of our stores globally as a result of these macroeconomic conditions the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred during the third quarter resulting in the need to perform a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the company’s stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible assets the assessment concluded that the fair values of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangible asset as of the third quarter did not exceed their respective carrying values accordingly in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2107 million related to the stuart weitzman reporting unit resulting in a full impairment during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company also recorded an impairment charge of 2670 million related to the stuart weitzman indefinitelived brand resulting in a full impairment the company considered the excess of the fair value over its carrying value for all coach and kate spade reporting unit and indefinitelived brand intangibles management did not perform an interim assessment for these reporting units 

based on the annual assessment the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand as of the fiscal 2020 testing date exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 13 and 35 respectively several factors could impact the kate spade brands ability to achieve expected future cash flows including continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the covid19 pandemic the reception of new collections in all channels the success of international expansion strategies including the direct operation of certain previous distributor and joint venture businesses the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores and the simplification of certain corporate overhead structures and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2021 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in 

merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys or individuals achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2020 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination the company considers all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized the company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities the company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the companys results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ transactions denominated in foreign currencies to mitigate such risk certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts as of june 27 2020 and june 29 2019  forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 5862 million and 3984 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 27 2020  

the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the chinese renminbi the british pound sterling and the euro to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company enters into forward currency contracts as of june 27 2020 and june 29 2019  the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were 769 million and 145 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding forward currency contracts included in current assets at june 27 2020 and june 29 2019 was 29 million and 11 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 27 2020 and june 29 2019 was 17 million and 49 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of june 27 2020  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility entered into under the credit agreement dated october 24 2019 as amended may 19 2020 the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes 2027 senior notes collectively the senior notes and investments 

our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at the company’s option either a an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 or b a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid as defined in the credit agreement based on the ratio of a consolidated debt plus operating lease liability to b consolidated ebitdar a hypothetical 10 change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2020  furthermore a prolonged disruption on our business resulting from the covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to satisfy the terms of our revolving credit facility including our liquidity covenant 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes at june 27 2020  the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately 577 million  393 million and 565 million  respectively at june 29 2019 the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes 

was approximately 630 million  399 million and 606 million  respectively these fair values are based on external pricing data including available quoted market prices of these instruments and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency among other factors and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody’s or sp or a substitute rating agency as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7 2017 downgrades or downgrades and subsequently upgrades the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series 

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards which are an integral part of our brands identity one of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials we have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade  company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our management team has and in the future will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition however there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business such as stuart weitzman and kate spade and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 however we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

a delay disruption in failure of or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations including management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our brands’ stores our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems 

the company embarked on a multiyear erp implementation in fiscal 2017 the substantial majority of the implementation was completed during fiscal 2019 and the remainder implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2020 implementing new systems 

carries substantial risk including failure to operate as designed failure to properly integrate with other systems potential loss of data or information cost overruns implementation delays and disruption of operations thirdparty vendors are also relied upon to design program maintain and service our erp implementation program any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business other substantial risks associated with the multiyear erp implementation include the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands’ stores or customers in a timely manner in addition any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our erp implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed defective corrupted inadequate or inaccessible furthermore failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations individually or in accumulation could have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global house of lifestyle brands 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we plan to open additional retail stores throughout asia and other international markets both directly and through strategic partners our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 437 of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 



 we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products 

most of our imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products to maximize opportunities we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and as a result we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our crossborder activity in may 2019 the united states increased the tariff rate from 10 to 25 on 200 billion of imports of select product categories into the us from china on august 1 2019 the trump administration announced that the us plans to implement an additional tariff of 10 on the remaining 300 billion of products imported into the us from china on september 1 2019 if the us follows through on its further proposed china tariffs or if the us or other countries impose additional duties taxes quotas andor withdraw from or materially modify trade agreements or other trade restrictions the cost of our products manufactured in china or such other countries and imported into the us or other countries could increase this could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels tax rates unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show 

volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 2 surrounding tenants or vacancies 3 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 4 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 5 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

tapestry inc is a new yorkbased house of modern luxury lifestyle brands our company and our brands are founded upon a consumerled view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer malware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with current and new state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the eu and the california consumer privacy act in california usa as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breach containment and notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we have ecommerce sites in certain countries throughout the world including the us canada japan mainland china several throughout europe and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally tapestry has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site and kate spade flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer malware or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements we hedge our cross currency intercompany inventory transactions as well as the company’s cross currency intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

as a result of having operations outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales operating income net interest expense earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels and  or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors’ expectations refer to “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier code of conduct however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program documents including our global operating principles anticorruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwtapestrycom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by tapestry to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia the us spain italy the uk canada australia and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry 

our wholesale business comprised approximately 11 of total net sales for fiscal 2019 continued fragmentation in the industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could 

disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

on december 22 2017 “hr1” formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax legislation” was signed into law the tax legislation which became effective on january 1 2018 significantly revised the us tax code refer to item 2 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  executive overview and note 15 “income taxes” for further information on the provisions of the tax legislation and the currently expected impact on the company the company has recorded its best estimate of impact of the tax legislation through its provision for income taxes in the fiscal year ended june 29 2019 pursuant to accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes and the sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 all amounts recorded were based on available guidance on interpretation of the tax legislation and the company believes reasonable approaches to estimating its impact as future guidance becomes available adjustments may be made to reflect the impact of such guidance in the provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

our brands currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for certain products refer to item 1  “ business  licensing ” for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases or conduct either program at expected levels after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of june 29 2019 our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 16 billion we also have the capacity to borrow up to 900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility which may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of the vote entitled to be cast by our stockholders the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including mergers consolidations share exchanges or in circumstances specified in the statute asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities between the company and any interested stockholder generally defined as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder

although the companys litigation as a defendant is routine and incidental to the conduct of tapestry’s business as well as for any business of its size such litigation can result in large monetary awards such as when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages

stuart weitzman production challenges 

during fiscal 2019 stuart weitzman results continued to be negatively impacted by the trailing impacts of the supply chain operational challenges which began in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 including production delays which caused lower than expected sales as the brand was not prepared for the level of complexity and new development as it transitioned to a new creative vision the company has addressed these challenges through investment in talent as well as added infrastructure and manufacturing capacity as a result of these investments stuart weitzman returned to sales growth in fiscal 2019

refer to note 6 restructuring activities and gaap to nongaap reconciliation herein for further information 

current trends and outlook 

the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending consumer preferences macroeconomic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies 

global consumer retail traffic trends remain under pressure this along with other factors has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion further declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

several organizations that monitor the worlds economy including the international monetary fund observed that global expansion is slowing at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected these organizations expect continued softening of the growth rates in the united states throughout the next two years and also observed challenging economic growth across markets around the globe recently furthermore there are factors noted that may pressure the economic growth levels currently anticipated as a result the current global outlook remains uncertain it is still too early to understand what kind of sustained impact these trends or changes in trade agreements and tax legislations will have on consumer discretionary spending 

risk of volatility or a worsening of the macroeconomic environment remains including currency devaluation due to political uncertainty and potential changes to international trade agreements during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the trump administration began to impose duties of 10 related to certain chinesemade imported products in may 2019 the united states increased the tariff rate from 10 to 25 on 200 billion of imports of select product categories into the us from china on august 1 2019 the trump administration announced that the us plans to implement an additional tariff of 10 on the remaining 300 billion of products imported into the us from china on september 1 2019 the company continues to monitor this development closely and supports strategies that help diffuse these trade tensions with china we expect these changes to have a modest impact on gross margin in fiscal 2020 continued increases in trade tensions could impact the companys ability to grow its business with the chinese consumer globally 

beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the company noted volatility in the spending patterns of certain north american customers believed to be resellers in advance of changes in chinese ecommerce laws effective january 1 2019 the volatility experienced during this period may continue in the nearterm the company also observed an acceleration in local customer demand in mainland china which has helped to partially offset this trend 

additional macroeconomic impacts include but are not limited to the united kingdom uk voting to leave the european union eu commonly known as brexit on march 29 2017 the uk triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the eu the uk and eu announced in march 2018 an agreement in principle to transitional provisions under which eu law would remain in force in the uk for an agreed period but this remains subject to the successful conclusion of a final withdrawal agreement between the parties and the ratification by uk parliament as of the date of this report the withdrawal agreement has been voted against three times by uk parliament as a consequence the eu and uk agreed to postpone brexit until october 31 2019 this date will be accelerated to anytime between now and october 31 2019 if a withdrawal agreement is successfully concluded between the parties and ratified by uk parliament increased uncertainty surrounds future brexit talks due to the new leadership of the british government following theresa mays resignation as prime minister on june 7 2019 and the election of boris johnson on july 23 2019 in the absence of a withdrawal agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a hard brexit would occur on october 31 2019 resulting in potential increased legal and regulatory complexities and divergent laws between the uk and the eu 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 reflect certain items including the impact of the erp implementation in fiscal 2019 integration and acquisition costs for acquired companies by tapestry the impact of tax legislation and in fiscal 2018 the operational efficiency plan as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

comparable store sales which is a nongaap measure reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet in certain instances orders placed via the internet are fulfilled by a physical store such sales are recorded by the physical store the company excludes new including newly acquired locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation the company excludes closed stores from the calculation comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions comparable store sales for kate spade have been calculated beginning on the acquisition date 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s internal management reporting excluded these items in addition the human resources committee of the company’s board uses these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects these effects occur from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance 

by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and 

should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial condition 

cash flows  fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 2050 million primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4425 million and lower noncash charges of 84 million  partially offset by higher net income of 2459 million  

the 4425 million de crease in changes in our operating asset and liability balances was primarily driven by

the 5742 million use of cash in fiscal 2019 is primarily due to purchases of investments of 4155 million and capital expenditures of 2742 million  this use of cash was partially offset by net cash proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of 1590 million  

the 216 billion use of cash in fiscal 2018 is primarily due to the 238 billion purchase of kate spade and other acquisitions net of cash acquired and capital expenditures of 2674 million  this use of cash was partially offset by net cash proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of 4784 million  

net cash used in financing activities

the comparison of fiscal 2018 to 2017 has been omitted from this form 10k but can be referenced in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 filed on august 16 2018 

working capital and capital expenditures 

as of june 29 2019  in addition to our cash flows from operations our sources of liquidity and capital resources were comprised of the following 





 we believe that our revolving credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of june 29 2019  there were 13 financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 13 we have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for among other things acquisition or integrationrelated costs our restructuring initiatives settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

management believes that cash flows from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines onhand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2020 including our plans for further investment in our brands while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 300 million our ability to fund working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond the companys control 

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

share repurchase plan 

on may 9 2019 the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase up to 100 billion of shares of its outstanding common stock pursuant to this program purchases of the companys common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares these shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes in addition the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time during fiscal 2019 the company repurchased 1000 million of common stock refer to part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further information 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of june 29 2019  the companys contractual obligations are as follows 





 excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 761 million as of june 29 2019  as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 29 2019 as these items will 

be paid within one year certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company’s pension plan 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit surety bonds and bank guarantees of 345 million as of june 29 2019  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty leases insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2039 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers which may be at a point of time or over time control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services the amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved 

retail store and concession shopinshop revenues are recognized at the pointofsale when the customer obtains physical possession of the products internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and internet revenues are recorded net of estimated returns which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience payment is due at the point of sale 

the company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns discounts endofseason markdowns cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer the companys historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results 

the company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the companys trademarks these arrangements require licensees to pay a salesbased royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess salesbased royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved 

at june 29 2019  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

the company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels including ecommerce sites substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at june 29 2019  a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items furthermore the company may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations if goodwill is identified based upon the valuation of an acquired business the goodwill is assigned to the reporting units which will benefit from the synergies that result from the business combination and reported within the segment that such reporting units comprise refer to note 3 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

upon acquisition the company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consists of brands customer relationships lease rights and order backlog goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including brand intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multiperiod excess earnings method respectively with consideration of market comparisons this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017  in all fiscal years the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand as of the fiscal 2019 testing date exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 21 and 61 respectively furthermore the fair values of the stuart weitzman brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 11 and 62 respectively since the annual assessment date the company has updated its projections to reflect more modest top line growth at kate spade and has concluded that all the intangible assets are not impaired as of june 29 2019  several factors could impact the kate spade and stuart weitzman brands ability to achieve expected future cash flows including the management of the supply chain operational challenges at stuart weitzman reception of new collections the success of international expansion strategies including the consolidation or integration of certain distributor relationships the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores the simplification of certain corporate overhead structures and other initiatives aimed at expanding higher performing categories of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2020 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys or individuals achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2019 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination the company considers all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized the company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities the company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the companys results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ transactions denominated in foreign currencies to mitigate such risk certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts as of june 29 2019 and june 30 2018  forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 3984 million and 2574 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 29 2019  

the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the chinese renminbi to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company enters into forward currency contracts as of june 29 2019 and june 30 2018  the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were 145 million and 1607 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding forward currency contracts included in current assets at june 29 2019 and june 30 2018 was 11 million and 60 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 29 2019 and june 30 2018 was 49 million and 24 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of june 29 2019  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade  company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business such as stuart weitzman and kate spade and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business including stuart weitzman andor kate spade and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2018 fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 however we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 a delay disruption in failure of or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations including management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our brands’ stores our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems 

the company has embarked on a multiyear erp implementation the company began this implementation in fiscal 2017 and it is expected to be substantially complete during fiscal 2019 implementing new systems carries substantial risk including failure to operate as designed failure to properly integrate with other systems potential loss of data or information cost overruns implementation delays and disruption of operations thirdparty vendors are also relied upon to design program maintain and service our erp implementation program any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business other substantial risks associated with the multiyear erp implementation include the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands’ stores or customers in a timely manner in addition any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our erp implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed defective corrupted inadequate or inaccessible furthermore failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations individually or in accumulation could have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and cash flow 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global house of lifestyle brands 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach kate spade and stuart weitzman stores throughout asia and other international markets both directly and through strategic partners our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

the successful execution of our operational efficiency and multiyear transformation initiatives is key to the longterm growth of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency update core technology platforms and optimize international supply chain and office locations these initiatives were adopted as a result of a strategic review of the company’s corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model the charges under this plan began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan concluded during fiscal 2016 the company believes that longterm growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time however there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in the longterm 

actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 restructuring activities for further information regarding these initiatives 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 412  of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

 economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 2 surrounding tenants or vacancies 3 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 4 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 5 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes 

in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with current and new state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the eu and the california consumer privacy act in california usa as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breachnotification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we have ecommerce sites in certain countries throughout the world including the us canada japan mainland china several throughout europe and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally tapestry has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site and invitationonly kate spade flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

tapestry inc is a new yorkbased house of modern luxury lifestyle brands our company and our brands are founded upon a consumerled view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability we believe that the coach brand established over 75 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service kate spade is known for its crisp color graphic prints and playful sophistication its exuberant approach to the everyday encourages personal style with a dash of incandescent charm furthermore the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of womens luxury footwear within north america with a strong opportunity for growth globally and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifullyconstructed shoe merging fashion and function any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies including our operational efficiency initiatives and transformation plan even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements we hedge a portion of our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan canada and china and eurodenominated inventory purchases in spain as well as the companys cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

as a result of having operations outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales operating income net interest expense earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors’ expectations refer to “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 if the trump administration follows through on its proposed china tariffs or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries or by the us the cost of our products manufactured in china or other countries and imported into the us or other countries could increase this could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier code of conduct however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwtapestrycom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent 

manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by tapestry to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan mainland china hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia the us spain italy the uk canada and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry 

our wholesale business comprised approximately 13 of total net sales for fiscal 2018 continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise despite our continued reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2018 such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands which could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

on december 22 2017 “hr1” formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax legislation” was signed into law the tax legislation which became effective on january 1 2018 significantly revised the us tax code refer to item 2 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  executive overview and note 14 “income taxes” for further information on the provisions of the tax legislation and the currently expected impact on the company the company has recorded its best estimate of impact of the tax legislation through its provision for income taxes in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 pursuant to accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes and the sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 all amounts recorded were based on available guidance on interpretation of the tax legislation and the company believes reasonable approaches to estimating its impact however such amounts are the company’s provisional estimates at this time for elements of the tax legislation where the company was not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact the company has not recorded any adjustments and has continued accounting for these elements in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax legislation the company cannot determine the amount of any such impacts at this time and amounts that have been estimated and recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 are subject to adjustment as future guidance becomes available additional facts become known or estimation approaches are refined the overall impact of the tax legislation is currently uncertain and the company’s business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

our brands currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for certain products refer to item 1  “ business  licensing ” for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners for example we did not renew our agreement with our prior footwear licensing partner when it expired in late fiscal 2017 and brought the category inhouse while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to successfully bring this category inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process or any future action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends or pay dividends at expected levels after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

 we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of june 30 2018 our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 16 billion we also have the capacity to borrow up to 900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility which may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of our stockholders the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including mergers consolidations share exchanges or in circumstances specified in the statute asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities between the company and any interested stockholder generally defined as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

the following table sets forth the location use and size of the companys key distribution corporate and product development facilities as of june 30 2018  the majority of the properties are leased with the leases expiring at various times through 2037 subject to renewal options 





 in addition to the above properties the company occupies leased retail and outlet store locations located in north america and internationally for each of our brands these leases expire at various times through 2032 the company considers these properties to be in generally good condition and believes that its facilities are adequate for its operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet its anticipated requirements refer to item 1 business and item 6 selected financial data for further information 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect tapestry incs intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured by advertising claims or upon premises within the companys control and litigation with present or former employees 

as part of tapestry’s policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time the company files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent infringement trade dress infringement copyright infringement unfair competition trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time tapestry may have a number of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of tapestry’s intellectual properties

current trends and outlook 

the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending consumer preferences macroeconomic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies 

global consumer retail traffic trends remain under pressure this along with other factors has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion further declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

after strong economic performance in calendar 2017 and the first half of 2018 including improvements in the labor market as well as modest growth in overall consumer spending the us economic outlook has improved and moderate economic growth is expected to continue in the next year several organizations that monitor the world’s economy including the international monetary fund observed economic strengthening across the majority of the globe recently and are projecting continued economic strengthening over the next year but anticipate that the growth will be inconsistent among different markets it is still however too early to understand what kind of sustained impact these trends or changes in trade agreements and tax legislation will have on consumer discretionary spending 

risk of volatility or a worsening of the macroeconomic environment remains due to political uncertainty and potential changes to international trade agreements the trump administration recently announced that the us is beginning the process to impose duties related to chinese made imported products certain of the companys offerings are included in this proposal however the company believes that there will be minimal impact given the diversity of its sourcing activities 

  additional macroeconomic impacts include but are not limited to the united kingdom uk voting to leave the european union eu commonly known as brexit on march 29 2017 the uk triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the eu the uk and eu announced in march 2018 an agreement in principle to transitional provisions under which eu law would remain in force in the uk until the end of december 2020 but this remains subject to the successful conclusion of a final withdrawal agreement between the parties in the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a hard brexit would occur on march 29 2019 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  reflect certain items including the impact of integration and acquisition costs for acquired companies by tapestry the operational efficiency plan the impact of the tax legislation enacted in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the transformation plan as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

comparable store sales which is a nongaap measure reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet in certain instances orders placed via the internet are fulfilled by a physical store such sales are recorded by the physical store the company excludes new locations including newly acquired stores from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions kate spade comparable store sales have been calculated using this methodology by comparing current period sales to sales during the equivalent preacquisition period 

furthermore the company’s sales and earnings per diluted share results are presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board will use these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain increases and decreases in operating results for the company the coach segment and the stuart weitzman segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects these effects occur from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods monthly average currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance 

by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures refer to item 6 selected financial data and the results of operations section within item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1429  million primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2657 million  and lower noncash charges of 707 million  partially offset by lower net income of 1935 million

working capital and capital expenditures 

as of june 30 2018  in addition to our cash flows from operations our sources of liquidity and capital resources were comprised of the following 





 we believe that our revolving credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of june 30 2018  there were 13 financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 13 we have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for among other things our restructuring initiatives acquisition or integrationrelated costs settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

management believes that cash flows from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines onhand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future our plans for acquisitions further business expansion and restructuringrelated initiatives 

we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of 300 to 325 million in fiscal 2019 future events such as acquisitions or joint ventures and other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all our ability to fund working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond the companys control 

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of june 30 2018  the companys contractual obligations are as follows 





 excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 756 million  as of june 30 2018  as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2018  as these items will be paid within one year certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company’s pension plan 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit surety bonds and bank guarantees of 351 million  as of june 30 2018  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty leases insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2039 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 12 commitments and contingencies for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopinshop revenues are recognized at the pointofsale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and internet revenues are also reduced by an estimate for returns at the time of sale 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of markdown allowances returns and discounts estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at june 30 2018  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at june 30 2018  a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations if goodwill is identified based upon the valuation of an acquired business the goodwill is assigned to the reporting units which will benefit from the synergies that result from the business combination and reported within the segment that such reporting units comprise refer to note 3 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including brand intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multiperiod excess earnings method respectively with consideration of market comparisons this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2016  as the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2018  as the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand significantly exceeded their respective carrying values furthermore the fair values of the stuart weitzman brand reporting unit and indefinitelived brand exceeded their respective carrying values by approximately 15 and 90 respectively several factors could impact the stuart weitzman brands ability to achieve future cash flows including the management of the supply chain operational challenges at stuart weitzman the success of international expansion strategies including the consolidation or takeback and integration of certain distributor relationships the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores the simplification of certain corporate overhead structures and other initiatives aimed at expanding higher performing categories of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2019 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2018 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized before the tax legislation the company considered the earnings of its nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly recorded no deferred income taxes on these earnings we are partially changing our assertion in fiscal 2018 and have recorded an estimate of the deferred tax impact associated with this change 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ us dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases to mitigate such risk certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts as of june 30 2018  and july 1 2017  forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 2574 million  and 1469 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 30 2018  

the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the australian dollar and the british pound sterling to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company enters into forward currency contracts as of june 30 2018  and july 1 2017  the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were 1607 million  and 955 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current assets at june 30 2018  and july 1 2017  was 60 million  and 35 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 30 2018  and july 1 2017  was 24 million  and 17 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of june 30 2018  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility entered into under the credit agreement dated may 30 2017 the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes 2027 senior notes collectively the senior notes and investments 

our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at the company’s option either a an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 or b a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid as defined in the credit agreement based on the ratio of a consolidated debt plus 600 of consolidated lease expense to b consolidated ebitdar a hypothetical 10 change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2018 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes at june 30 2018  the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately 593 million  389 million  and 574 million  respectively at july 1 2017 the fair value of the 2025 senior notes 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes 

was approximately 624 million  395 million  and 596 million  respectively these fair values are based on external pricing data including available quoted market prices of these instruments and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency among other factors and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody’s or sp or a substitute rating agency as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7 2017 downgrades or downgrades and subsequently upgrades the credit rating assigned to the respective senior note of such series 

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards which are an integral part of our identity one of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials we have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities 

we maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in vietnam china hong kong the philippines singapore and spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities

seasonality 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the winter and holiday season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday season 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

 government regulation 

most of coachs imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products the company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost to maximize opportunities we operate complex supply chains through foreign trade zones bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements additionally the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide as a result the company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its crossborder activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company’s products the company maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its importexport activity

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings llc during fiscal 2015 and our recent acquisition of kate spade  company on july 11 2017 our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business such as stuart weitzman and kate spade and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business including stuart weitzman andor kate spade and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 however we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the successful execution of our operational efficiency and multiyear transformation initiatives is key to the longterm growth of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency update core technology platforms and streamline the company’s supply chain network these initiatives were undertaken as a result of a strategic review of the company’s corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model the charges under this plan 

began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and were substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017 there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth which will enable the company to return to bestinclass profitability key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan included i the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement ii the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america and select international stores iii the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences iv the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand drive sales growth and promote our new strategy and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment particularly within our outlet internet sales site the companys execution of these key operational and cost measures concluded during fiscal 2016 the company believes that longterm growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving longterm growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand 

actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3 restructuring activities for further information regarding these initiatives 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china europe and other international markets both directly and through strategic partners our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 46  of our net sales from the coach and stuart weitzman brands coming from operations outside of united states while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 



 economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

 unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

  a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales 

the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 2 surrounding tenants or vacancies 3 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 4 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 5 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breachnotification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we maintain ecommerce sites in the us canada japan mainland china south korea and several throughout europe and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally coach has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company has embarked on a multiyear erp implementation the company began implementation in fiscal 2017 and will continue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 if the execution of our plans falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

we believe that the coach brand established over 75 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service furthermore the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of womens luxury footwear within north america with a strong opportunity for growth globally and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifullyconstructed shoe merging fashion and function any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies including our operational efficiency initiatives and transformation plan even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada and eurodenominated inventory purchases in spain as well as the companys cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

as a result of operating retail stores outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel abroad andor purchase our products while traveling as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors’ expectations see “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 



 we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier code of conduct however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwcoachcom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by coach to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan mainland china hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia the united states spain canada and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease the majority of our stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years often with renewal options we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things 

payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry 

our north american wholesale business comprised approximately 3 of total net sales for fiscal 2017  continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise despite our reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2017 such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands which could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

us lawmakers are evaluating proposals for substantial changes to us fiscal and tax policies which could include comprehensive tax reform a variety of tax reform proposals that would significantly impact us taxation of corporations are under consideration including elimination of the interest deduction taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings and reductions in the us corporate tax rate we cannot predict which if any of these proposals will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our financial results however if new legislation were enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

the companys results are typically affected by seasonal trends we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

the coach brand currently has multiyear agreements with licensing partners for our eyewear watches and fragrance products see item 1  “ business  products ” for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners for example we did not renew our agreement with our prior footwear licensing partner when it expired in late fiscal 2017 and brought the category inhouse while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to successfully bring this category inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process or any future action to bring currently licensed categories inhouse 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

 we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of july 1 2017 our consolidated indebtedness was approximately 16 billion subsequent to fiscal year 2017 we borrowed 11 billion in term loans together with our cash on hand and cash on hand at kate spade along with the 10 billion of senior notes and 11 billion in term loans we financed our acquisition of kate spade we also have 600 million of additional senior unsecured notes outstanding and capacity to borrow up to 900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility which may be used to finance our working capital needs capital expenditures permitted investments share purchases dividends and other general corporate purposes this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities in addition the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt grant liens engage in mergers and dispose of assets these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures in addition our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits a majority of its entire board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can only be amended by our board the companys bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the companys board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including in certain circumstances specified in the statute issuances of equity securities between the company and any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly 10 or more of the companys common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the companys board 

risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts “hdrs” 

an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly 

we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange will develop or be sustained if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected as a result the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach’s common stock on the nyse even allowing for currency differences 

the characteristics of the us capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different 

the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours trading characteristics including trading volume and liquidity trading and listing rules and investor bases including different levels of retail and institutional participation as a result of these differences the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same even allowing for currency differences fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances particular to the us capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs because of the different characteristics of the us and hong kong equity markets the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company 

hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them 

if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs 

an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs 

our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be canceled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently canceled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period 

there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars 

the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

current trends and outlook 

global consumer retail traffic remains relatively weak and inconsistent which has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion while certain developed geographic regions are withstanding these pressures better than others the level of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items remains constrained due to the economic uncertainty declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value 

political and economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions that exist in our major markets have further contributed to this uncertainty including the potential impact of 1 new policies that may be implemented by the us presidential administration and government particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or 2 the united kingdom uk voting to leave the european union eu commonly known as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the eu the uk has two years to complete these negotiations although the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu are still unknown it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the uk and eu brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees 

additional macroeconomic events including foreign exchange rate volatility in various parts of the world recent and evolving impacts of economic and geopolitical events in hong kong macau and mainland china greater china the impact of terrorist 

acts particularly in europe disease epidemics and a slowdown in emerging market growth particularly in asia have contributed to this uncertainty our results have been impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations and will continue to fluctuate with future volatility 

certain limited and recent factors within the us including an improvement in the labor and housing markets and modest growth in overall consumer spending suggest a potential moderate strengthening in the us economic outlook it is still however too early to understand what kind of sustained impact this will have on consumer discretionary spending if the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile or worsens the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our outlook several organizations that monitor the worlds economy including the international monetary fund are projecting slightly accelerated economic strengthening with modest overall global growth for the remainder of calendar 2017 but caution that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the underlying assumptions of the forecast 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands 

furthermore refer to part i item 1  business for additional discussion on our expected store openings and closures within each of our segments for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations see part i item 1a  risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  reflect certain items including the impact of the transformation plan the operational efficiency plan and acquisitionrelated charges as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

furthermore the company’s sales and earnings per diluted share results are presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board will use these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain increases and decreases in operating results for the company the coach brand and the companys north america and international segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods monthly average currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may 

be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopinshop revenues are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers retail and internet revenues are also reduced by an estimate for returns at the time of sale 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of markdown allowances returns and discounts estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at july 1 2017  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at july 1 2017  a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations refer to note 7 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including trademarks and trade names are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the relief from royalty method respectively with consideration of market comparisons and recent transactions this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates royalty rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which may include projected future cash flows discount rates royalty rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill including trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  or fiscal 2015  as the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values furthermore given the recency of our stuart weitzman acquisition the fair values of the stuart weitzman brand reporting unit and indefinitelived trademarks and trade names exceeded their respective carrying values of 2670 million and 1560 million respectively by approximately 20 several factors could impact the stuart weitzman brands ability to achieve future cash flows including the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores the consolidation or takeback of certain distributor relationships the simplification of certain corporate overhead structures and other initiatives aimed at expanding higher performing categories of the business given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2018 from those that are expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2017 net income 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including 

scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as such amounts are considered to be permanently invested 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards which are an integral part of our identity one of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials we have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain a level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities 

we maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing management offices in vietnam china hong kong the philippines and spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities

seasonality 

seasonality primarily impacts the coach brand because coach brands products are frequently given as gifts we experience seasonal variations in net sales operating cash flows and working capital requirements primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december 

fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

 government regulation

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the successful execution of our multiyear transformation and operational efficiency initiatives is key to the longterm growth of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth which will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan included i the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement ii the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america and select international stores iii the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences iv the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand drive sales growth and promote our new strategy and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment particularly within our outlet internet sales site the companys execution of these key operational and cost measures was concluded during fiscal 2016 the company believes that longterm growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving longterm growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency update core technology platforms and streamline the company’s supply chain network these initiatives were undertaken as a result of a strategic review of the company’s corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model the charges under this plan began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and we anticipate they will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2017 there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results 

actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3 restructuring activities for further information regarding these initiatives 

if the execution of our plans or strategies fall short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china europe and other international markets both directly and through strategic partners our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition some of these markets have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 45  of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

 economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag footwear and accessories categories generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

 unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

in addition the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by 1 the location of the store within the mall or shopping center 2 surrounding tenants or vacancies 3 increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located 4 the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall and 5 a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate furthermore the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations 

one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings llc during fiscal 2015 our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms 

the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business such as stuart weitzman and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business including stuart weitzman and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2016 fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 however we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breachnotification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we maintain ecommerce sites in the us canada uk japan mainland china and south korea and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally coach has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business lastly our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and the stuart weitzman brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

we believe that the coach brand established 75 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service furthermore the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of womens luxury footwear within north america with a strong opportunity for growth globally and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifullyconstructed shoe merging fashion and function any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies including our transformation plan and operational efficiency initiatives even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada and eurodenominated inventory purchases in spain as well as the companys cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars 

as a result of operating retail stores outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel abroad andor purchase our products while traveling as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors’ expectations see “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 



 we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier code of conduct however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website wwwcoachcom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by coach to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan mainland china hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia the united states spain canada and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease our corporateowned stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years with renewal options typically in five year increments we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable and have similar renewal options generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be 

unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our transformation plan and operational efficiency initiatives and their attendant organizational changes as well as the impact of brexit may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry 

our north american wholesale business comprised approximately 4 of total net sales for fiscal 2016  continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

additionally certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise despite our planned reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2017 such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands which could affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

seasonality primarily impacts the coach brand because coach brands products are frequently given as gifts we have historically realized and expect to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in the companys second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

we currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for our footwear eyewear watches and fragrance products see item 1  “ business  products ” for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners for example we do not intend to renew our agreement with our existing footwear licensing partner when it expires in late fiscal 2017 and bring the category inhouse while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to bring this category inhouse we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives 

we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities and issued debt securities as a source of liquidity along with cash flows generated from our operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our noncurrent investments and other available financing options we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

we could experience disruptions to our operations in connection with the relocation to our new global corporate headquarters 

the company entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company’s new global corporate headquarters in a new office building located at 10 hudson yards in new york city on august 1 2016 the company sold its ownership interest in the building and substantially all of the related tenant improvements for a purchase price of approximately 707 million net of approximately 77 million due to the developer of hudson yards before transaction costs of 26 million resulting in a gain of about 30 million which will be amortized through selling general and administrative expenses over the lease term of 20 years the company has simultaneously entered into a 20year lease for the headquarters space comprised of approximately 694000 square feet refer to note 11 commitments and contingencies and note 19 subsequent events for further information we began occupying the new building during fiscal 2016 with occupancy in the new global headquarters expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal 2017 

due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project in addition the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations thus our move could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified 

shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can only be amended by our board the companys bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between the company and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the companys common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the companys board

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company 

hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them 

if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs 

an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs 

our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be canceled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently canceled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period 

there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars 

the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

 harness the power of the digital world 

 build an infrastructure to support future growth initiatives 



transformation plan 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 coach inc announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the coach brand and reinvigorating growth which we believe will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability this transformation plan was built on the core brand equities of quality and craftsmanship with the aim of evolving our competitive value proposition we believe our strategy offers significant growth opportunities in handbags and accessories as well as in the broader set of lifestyle categories that we have operated in for some time but have historically been less developed including footwear and readytowear this strategy required an integrated holistic approach across product stores and marketing and promotional activities and entails the rollout of carefully crafted aspirational marketing campaigns to define the coach brand and to deliver a fuller and more consistent brand expression 

key operational and cost measures of the transformation plan included i the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement ii the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america and select international stores iii the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences iv the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand drives sales growth and promote our new strategy which started in fiscal 2015 and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment particularly within our outlet internet sales site which began in fiscal 2014 the companys execution of these key operational and cost measures was concluded during fiscal 2016 and we believe that longterm growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time for further discussion of charges incurred in connection with the transformation plan see gaap to nongaap reconciliation herein 

operational efficiency plan 

on april 26 2016 the company announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model the operational efficiency plan the significant majority of the charges under this plan will be recorded within sga expenses and will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017 these charges are associated with organizational efficiencies primarily related to the reduction of corporate staffing levels globally as well as accelerated depreciation mainly associated with information systems retirement technology infrastructure charges related to the initial costs of replacing and updating our core technology platforms and international supply chain and office location optimization refer to note 3 restructuring activities and gaap to nongaap reconciliation for further information 

current trends and outlook 

global consumer retail traffic remains relatively weak and inconsistent which has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion while certain developed geographic regions are withstanding these pressures better than others the level of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items remains constrained due to the economic uncertainty 

political and economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions that exist in our major markets including the impact of 1 the united kingdom voting to leave the european union in its referendum on june 23 2016 and 2 the outcome of the 2016 us presidential election have further contributed to this uncertainty on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum its expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu although it is unknown what those terms will be it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the uk and eu brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees 

additional macroeconomic events including foreign exchange rate volatility in various parts of the world recent and evolving impacts of economic and geopolitical events in hong kong macau and mainland china greater china the impact of terrorist acts particularly in europe disease epidemics and a slowdown in emerging market growth particularly in asia have contributed to this uncertainty our results have been negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations and will continue to fluctuate with future volatility 

certain of our wholesale customers particularly those located in the us have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise despite our planned reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2017 such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands which could affect our business results of operations and financial condition over the next year we expect to continue investing in the elevation of shopinshop environments and rationalizing the distribution footprint in the north america wholesale channel by closing about 25 of doors from fiscal 2016 yearend levels 

certain limited and recent factors within the us including an improvement in the labor and housing markets and modest growth in overall consumer spending suggest a potential moderate strengthening in the us economic outlook it is still however too early to understand what kind of sustained impact this will have on consumer discretionary spending if the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile or worsens the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our outlook as a result of these factors several organizations that monitor the worlds economy including the international monetary fund have modestly decreased overall global growth forecasts for the remainder of calendar 2016 and calendar 2017 

we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands 

furthermore refer to part i item 1  business for additional discussion on our expected store openings and closures within each of our segments for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations see part i item 1a  risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  reflect certain items including the impact of the transformation plan the operational efficiency plan and acquisitionrelated charges as a supplement to the companys reported results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

furthermore the company’s sales and earnings per diluted share results are presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board will use these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in us dollars in accordance with gaap fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in us dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit accordingly certain increases and decreases in operating results for the company the coach brand and the companys north america and international segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year periods monthly average currency conversion rate 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company’s business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit 75 million  as of july 2 2016  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for insurance claims material used in product manufacturing and store leases these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2017 

as discussed earlier the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies lp to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district in april 2013 the formation of the hudson yards joint venture served as a financing vehicle for the project refer to note 19 subsequent events for further information 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 11 commitments and contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopinshop revenues are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers revenues are also reduced by an estimate for returns at the time of sale 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of markdown allowances returns and discounts estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at july 2 2016  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in the companys reserves and net sales 

inventories 

substantially all of the companys inventories are comprised of finished goods and are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at july 2 2016  a 10 change in the inventory reserve would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition the company records all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations refer to note 7 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including trademarks and trade names are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the relief from royalty method respectively with consideration of market comparisons and recent transactions this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values if based on the results of the qualitative assessment it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value a quantitative test is performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business 

combination in other words the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill including trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  or fiscal 2014  as the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values furthermore given the recency of our stuart weitzman acquisition the fair value of the stuart weitzman brand reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value by less than 20 valued using discounted cash flow method additionally the percentage by which the fair value of the stuart weitzman brand indefinitelived trademarks and trade names exceeded its carrying value was less than 5 valued using the relief from royalty method several factors could impact the stuart weitzman brands ability to achieve future cash flows including the optimization of the store fleet productivity the impact of promotional activity in department stores the consolidation or takeback of certain distributor relationships the simplification of certain corporate overhead structures and other initiatives aimed at expanding certain higher performing categories of the business as previously noted the fair value of the acquired goodwill and trademarks and trade names continue to be inline with the fair value of the net assets of the segment approximately one year subsequent to acquisition however given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above if the profitability trends or market multiples decline during fiscal 2017 from those that were expected it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test could result in an impairment of these assets 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows the company takes various factors into account including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending instore capital investments promotional cadence the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2016 net income by approximately 7 million 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as such amounts are considered to be permanently invested 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ us dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases to mitigate such risk coach japan coach canada and stuart weitzman enter into foreign currency derivative contracts primarily forward foreign currency contracts as of july 2 2016  and june 27 2015  zerocost collar options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 1901 million  and 1267 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of july 2 2016  

the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the singapore dollar the euro the british pound sterling the new taiwan dollar and the chinese renminbi to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company primarily enters into forward exchange as of july 2 2016  and june 27 2015  the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts related to these loans were 755 million  and 258 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 2 2016  and june 27 2015  was 06 million  and 34 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at july 2 2016  and june 27 2015  was 111 million  and 02 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of july 2 2016  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its amended and restated credit agreement including the term loan the 4250 senior notes and investments 

our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement including the term loan on august 3 2016 the company prepaid its outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility refer to note 19 subsequent events for further information borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at coach’s option either a a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus an applicable margin or b an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 a hypothetical 10 change in the amended and restated credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an insignificant change in interest expense in fiscal 2016 furthermore we are also exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of our 6000 million  4250 senior notes at july 2 2016  the fair value of the 4250 senior notes was approximately 6216 million  

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels 

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising total expenses attributable to coach brand marketingrelated events in fiscal 2015  were 1589 million or approximately 4 of net sales compared to 1301  million in fiscal 2014 or approximately 3 of net sales 

coachs wide range of direct marketing activities includes email contacts and catalogs targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue in addition to building brand awareness and driving online revenue coachs websites serve as an effective brand communication vehicle by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors which drives store traffic and enables the collection of customer data 

as part of the coachs direct marketing strategy we use databases primarily consisting of approximately 28 million households in north america approximately 11 million households in asia and approximately 380000 households in europe email contacts and direct mail pieces are an important part of coachs communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness visitors to coachs ecommerce sites in the us canada japan and china provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases as well as point of sale transactions globally except where restricted

manufacturing 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including vietnam mainland china the philippines india thailand italy hong kong myanmar and the united states coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets during fiscal 2015  the coach brand had two vendors who each provided slightly over 10 of the companys total units these two vendors are geographically dispersed and have multiple locations in different countries no other individual vendor currently provides more than approximately 10 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards which are an integral part of our identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain a level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

we maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing management offices in vietnam greater china hong kong and the philippines that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities 

distribution 

in north america the company operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida for coach brand products this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coachs distribution center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coach brand products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers 

outside of north america the company has established regional distribution centers through thirdparties in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands for coach brand products coach also operates local distribution centers through thirdparties in japan china hong kong south korea taiwan malaysia singapore and macau for coach brand products 

information systems 

the foundation of coachs information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this integrated system supports finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for coachs transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is suitable for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a global platform for management reporting the supply chain management systems support product development procurement inventory planning and reporting functions in north america product fulfillment is facilitated by coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coachs internet business are supported by coach’s order management and ecommerce systems internationally coach selectively relies on the warehouse and distribution systems owned by the thirdparties that operate certain of our international distributions centers additionally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality 

trademarks and patents 

coach owns all of the material worldwide trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products in addition it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which our products are sold major trademarks include coach coach new york coach and horse  carriage design coach and story patch design coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design and op art c design and coach leatherware est 1941 the heritage logo coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coachs products are covered by design patents and a utility patent application coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them 

seasonality 

because coach brands products are frequently given as gifts we experience seasonal variations in net sales operating cash flows and working capital requirements primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping during the first fiscal quarter we build inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions 

 government regulation 

most of coachs imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business however customs duties do represent a material part of total product cost to maximize opportunities coach operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements additionally coach operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide as a result coach is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its crossborder activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of coach’s products coach maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its importexport activity 

competition 

the premium handbag footwear and accessories industry is highly competitive coach competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coachs wholesale customers over the last several years these categories have grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors this increased competition drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

employees 

as of june 27 2015  coach brand employed approximately 15800 globally including both full and part time employees but excluding seasonal and temporary employees of these employees approximately 7400 and 5700 were full time and part time employees respectively in the global retail field coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the successful execution of our multiyear transformation initiatives is key to the longterm growth of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth which will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan include i the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement ii the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america and select international stores iii the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences iv the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our brand drive sales growth and promote our new strategy and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment particularly within our outlet internet sales site the company believes that longterm growth can be realized through its transformational efforts over time there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving longterm growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand furthermore actual costs incurred under the transformation plan may differ from expectations based on our execution of the key operational and cost elements described above refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3 transformation and other actions for further information regarding the transformation plan 

if the execution of our transformation plan falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china europe and other international markets both directly and through strategic partners our brands may not be wellestablished or widely sold in some of these markets and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there in addition many of these markets have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront shortterm investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 39  of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

 

 economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs including oil prices global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as the companys products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers’ willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located 

our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products 

our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition and a highly promotional environment fragmentation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer spending patterns if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brands 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is likely such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of the companys wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations the acquired stuart weitzman business may underperform relative to our expectations and the stuart weitzman acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community 

during fiscal 2015 we acquired stuart weitzman holdings llc a leading designer and manufacturer of womens luxury footwear we may have difficulty integrating the stuart weitzman business into our operations or otherwise successfully managing the expansion of the stuart weitzman business additionally while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms or at all the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business such as stuart weitzman and realizing our expectations for an acquisition including the benefits that may be realized include among other things 

 our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business including stuart weitzman and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 however we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat the retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyberattacks as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers employees and lawmakers is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats or to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our 

intellectual property lastly we could face sizable fines significant breachnotification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we maintain ecommerce sites in the us canada japan and china and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally coach has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business lastly our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems iii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and the stuart weitzman brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

we believe that the coach brand established almost 75 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service furthermore the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of womens luxury footwear within north america with a strong opportunity for growth globally and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifullyconstructed shoe merging fashion and function any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our transformation plan even if our products marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada as well as the companys cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations sales to our international wholesale customers are primarily denominated in us dollars 

as a result of operating retail stores outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel abroad andor purchase our products while traveling as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance including our ability to return value to investors 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock 

price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors’ expectations see “ if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed ” for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation 

in addition we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier selection guidelines however we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are available through our website wwwcoachcom the 

violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida operated by coach to support our growth in mainland china and europe we established distribution centers in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan mainland china hong kong singapore taiwan malaysia the united states and south korea the warehousing of the companys merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease our corporateowned stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years with renewal options typically in five year increments we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable and have similar renewal options generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our transformation plan and its attendant changes regarding organizational efficiencies may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have experienced turnover of several senior management roles and we have focused time and resources on recruiting or promoting from within the new members of our current senior management team the continued turnover of senior management or the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry 

our north american wholesale business primarily consisting of the us wholesale business comprised approximately 5 of total net sales for fiscal 2015  continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

we currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for our footwear eyewear watches and fragrance products see item 1  “ business  products ” for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

as we outsource functions we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers over which we have no control could also have an adverse effect on our business furthermore we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and costeffective basis on terms favorable to us 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock 

because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in coach’s second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives 

we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities and issued debt securities as a source of liquidity along with cash flows generated from our operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our noncurrent investments and other available financing options we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of and relocation to our new global corporate headquarters 

the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company’s new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city the financing development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2015 the company invested 1391 million  in the hudson yards joint venture resulting in a total equity method investment of 3202 million  as of june 27 2015 the company expects to invest approximately 210 million  in the joint venture over the next two years with approximately 195 million  estimated in fiscal 2016 depending on construction progress outside of the joint venture the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters the company has incurred 340 million of capital expenditures to date including 59 million  in fiscal 2015 and we expect approximately 185 million  of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction the company’s allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand debtrelated borrowings and approximately 130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings 

due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project in addition the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations thus that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of or value of the building in which our new global headquarters will be located further our developer has financing construction and development obligations to parties other than us and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project 

the ownership of real property such as the new global corporate headquarters also subjects us to various other risks including among others 

 provisions in the companys charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party 

the companys charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board the companys charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue in addition the companys board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although the companys board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the companys stockholders 

the companys bylaws can only be amended by our board the companys bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to the companys board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by the companys board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between the company and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the companys common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the companys board 

risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts “hdrs” 

an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly 

we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange will develop or be sustained if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected as a result the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach’s common stock on the nyse even allowing for currency differences 

the characteristics of the us capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different 

the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours trading characteristics including trading volume and liquidity trading and listing rules and investor bases including different levels of retail and institutional participation as a result of these differences the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same even allowing for currency differences fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances particular to the us capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs because of the different characteristics of the us and hong kong equity markets the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company 

hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them 

if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs 

an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs 

our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be cancelled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period 

there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars 

the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document when used herein the terms “company” coach “we” “us” and “our” refer to coach inc including consolidated subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise references to the coach brand do not include the stuart weitzman brand and references to the stuart weitzman brand do not include the coach brand 

executive overview 

coach inc is a leading new york design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands the coach brand was established in new york city in 1941 and has a rich heritage of pairing exceptional leathers and materials with innovative design 

coach inc operates in three segments north america international and other which includes the stuart weitzman brand acquired by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the north america segment includes sales to north american customers through coachoperated stores including the internet and sales to north american wholesale customers the international segment includes sales to customers through coachoperated stores including the internet and concession shopinshops in japan and mainland china coachoperated stores and concession shopinshops in hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia south korea the united kingdom france ireland spain portugal germany italy belgium and the netherlands as well as sales to wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 45  countries other consists of sales and expenses generated by the coach brand in other ancillary channels including licensing and disposition other also consists of sales and expenses generated by the stuart weitzman brand during the final two months of fiscal 2015 as the companys business model is based on multichannel global distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to drive growth within our global business we are focused on four key initiatives which directly align with the coach brand transformation plan described below 

 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 coach inc announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the coach brand and reinvigorating growth which we believe will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability this multifaceted multiyear transformation plan the transformation plan builds on the core brand equities of quality and craftsmanship with the aim of evolving our competitive value proposition we believe our strategy offers significant growth opportunities in handbags and accessories as well as in the broader set of lifestyle categories that we have operated in for some time but are less developed including footwear and readytowear this strategy has required an integrated holistic approach across product stores and marketing and promotional activities and entails the rollout of carefully crafted aspirational marketing campaigns to define the coach brand and to deliver a fuller and more consistent brand expression 

key operational and cost measures of the transformation plan include i the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement ii the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america and select international stores iii the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences iv the investment of approximately 50 million in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand drives sales growth and promote our new strategy which started in fiscal 2015 and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment particularly within our outlet internet sales site which began in fiscal 2014 the companys execution of these key operational and cost measures were on plan through the end of fiscal 2015 and we believe that longterm 

growth can be realized through these transformational efforts over time for further discussion of charges incurred in connection with the transformation plan see items affecting comparability herein 

furthermore as discussed in note 7 acquisitions the company acquired luxury designer footwear brand stuart weitzman which we believe will complement our current leadership position in premium handbags and accessories while immediately adding to the companys earnings as we continue to make meaningful progress towards our brand transformation the acquisition was consummated on may 4 2015 and the brand contributed 430 million in net sales in fiscal 2015 included within our other segment 

current trends and outlook 

in addition to the risks surrounding the successful execution of our transformation plan initiatives our outlook reflects a certain level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy the global economic environment continues to have an impact on consumer confidence which in turn influences the level of spending on discretionary items global consumer retail traffic remained relatively weak and inconsistent which has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion macroeconomic and geopolitical events in greater china and southeast asia have contributed to volatility in consumer spending within the region furthermore it is still too early to understand the impact if any of mers middle east respiratory syndrome on consumer spending in asia including the impact on tourism in the region 

within the us a prolonged and tough winter season impacted demand during the first half of calendar 2015 however certain limited and recent factors within the us including an improvement in the labor market and modest growth in overall consumer spending suggest a potential moderate strengthening in the us economic outlook it is still however too early to understand what kind of sustained impact this will have on consumer discretionary spending if the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile or worsens the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our outlook 

we will continue to monitor these risks and trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands 

as discussed in part i item 1  business and as part of our transformation plan as described in note 3 transformation and other actions in fiscal 2015 we have reduced the number of retail stores and total square footage within north america as we continue to optimize our real estate position we expect this trend to continue in the next fiscal year with the anticipated closure of approximately 1520 north america retail stores in fiscal 2016 attributable to our transformation plan we expect to continue to see modest to no growth in north america outlet store square footage as we continue to optimize our real estate position across channels by expanding our most productive stores to accommodate a broader expression of lifestyle assortment while continuing to assess opportunities to close underperforming stores within our international segment we are expecting to reflect modest growth in our store count over the next few years particularly within mainland china and europe lastly within stuart weitzman we are expecting modest growth in our real estate position over the next year 

for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations see part i item 1a  risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k

currency fluctuation effects

net sales 

net sales decreased 128 or 6146 million  to 419 billion  in fiscal 2015  excluding the effects of foreign currency net sales decreased 106 or 5113 million this decrease was driven by lower sales in the north america business partially offset by gains in the international business and a 430 million contribution due to the acquisition of stuart weitzman the following table presents net sales by reportable segment for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  





 comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions 

north america net sales  decreased 204  or  6330 million  to  247 billion  in fiscal 2015  excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency due to the canadian dollar net sales decreased 6225 million or 201 this decrease was primarily driven by lower comparable store sales of 6134 million or 22 due to lower traffic as a result of a decrease in promotional activity partially offset by higher transaction size the internet business had a negative impact of approximately 740 basis points on comparable store sales which is attributable to the companys decision to both limit access and reduce the promotional cadence on our outlet internet sales site north america sales were also negatively impacted by lower wholesale sales of approximately 539 million due to lower shipments these decreases were partially offset by a net increase of 324 million related to net sales generated by new store openings which were partially offset by the absence of net sales for those stores that have closed since fiscal 2014 since the end of fiscal 2014 coach closed a net 74 retail stores and a net three outlet stores including the closure of 11 men’s outlet stores 

 international net sales  decreased 13  or  222 million  to  162 billion  in fiscal 2015  excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency primarily due to the japanese yen net sales increased 708 million or 43 this increase was primarily due to growth in greater china which includes hong kong and macau reflecting an increase of 505 million primarily due to net new stores and positive comparable store sales an increase of 367 million related to net new store openings and positive comparable store sales of our business in europe and an increase of 157 million in our international wholesale business partially due to higher shipments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales in japan of 374 million due to lower traffic as a result of lapping the pull forward in demand in advance of the april 2014 consumption tax increase since the end of fiscal 2014 we opened 28 net new stores with 16 net new stores in mainland china hong kong and macau and japan and 12 net new stores in the other regions 

other net sales  increased 660  or 406 million to 1021 million  primarily due to the impact of the stuart weitzman acquisition 

gross profit

advertising marketing and design costs were 2468 million or 59 of net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to 2423 million or 50 of net sales during fiscal 2014  the increase was the result of higher costs for marketingrelated events which increased by 288 million as compared to fiscal 2014 partially offset by fewer promotional events made by the company primarily as a result of the companys decision to limit access to our outlet internet sales site 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 696 million or 17 of net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  expenses of 872 million or 18 of net sales the decrease was primarily due to lower variable costs as a result of lower sales associated with the companys decision to limit access to our outlet internet sales site

in october 2012 the company’s board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program to acquire up to 15 billion of coach’s outstanding common stock through june 2015 as of june 27 2015 the program has expired 

purchases of coach common stock are made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases under maryland law coach’s state of incorporation treasury shares are not allowed as a result all repurchased shares are retired when acquired 

during fiscal 2015  the company did not repurchase or retire any shares during fiscal 2014  the company repurchased and retired 102  million shares or 5249  million of common stock at an average cost of 5127  

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of june 27 2015  the companys contractual obligations are as follows in millions 





 excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 1857 million as of june 27 2015  as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 27 2015  as these items will be paid within one year certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company’s pension plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit 68 million as of june 27 2015  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for insurance claims and store leases these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2016 

as discussed earlier the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies lp to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district in april 2013 the formation of the hudson yards joint venture serves as a financing vehicle for the project construction of the new building has commenced and upon expected completion of the office tower in fiscal 2016 the company will retain a condominium interest serving as its new corporate headquarters the company’s maximum loss exposure is limited to the committed capital 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 12 commitments and contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on the companys accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopinshop revenues are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction these revenues are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers internet revenue is also reduced by an estimate for returns 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns discounts and markdown allowances returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at june 27 2015  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in the companys reserves and net sales 

gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed at which point revenue is recognized the company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote which is approximately two years after the gift card is issued and the company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property revenue associated with gift card breakage is not material to the company’s net operating results 

inventories 

the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are primarily determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for inventory including slowmoving and aged inventory based on current product demand expected future demand and historical experience a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact the companys evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at june 27 2015  a 10 change in the inventory reserve excluding amounts associated with the transformation plan would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of sales refer to note 3 transformation and other actions for charges related to inventory under the companys transformation plan 

business combinations 

in connection with an acquisition we are required to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date these fair value determinations require our judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we may utilize independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations refer to note 7 acquisitions for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives including trademarks and trade names are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and and along with other longlived assets as noted above are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable estimates of fair value for finitelived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows with consideration of market comparisons and recent transactions this approach may use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates and growth rates 

the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analysis using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values if based on the results of the qualitative assessment it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value a quantitative test is performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination in other words the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is based on managements assessment considering independent thirdparty appraisals when necessary furthermore this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows market comparisons and recent transactions these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill including trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  or fiscal 2013  as the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions 

in determining future cash flows coach takes various factors into account including changes in merchandising strategy the emphasis on retail store cost controls the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending the impacts of the experienced level of retail store managers the level of advertising promotional cadence and instore capital investments since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the companys stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation 

expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2015 net income by approximately 7 million 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 significant accounting policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the companys risk management policies and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars the majority of the companys purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk is limited the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries’ us dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases to mitigate such risk coach japan and coach canada enter into foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options and forward foreign currency contracts as of june 27 2015  and june 28 2014  zerocost collar options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 1267 million  and 902 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 27 2015  

the company is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the singapore dollar the euro the british pound sterling the new taiwan dollar and the malaysian ringgit to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company primarily enters into forward exchange and crosscurrency swap contracts as of june 27 2015  and june 28 2014  the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and crosscurrency swap contracts related to these loans were 258 million  and 132 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 27 2015  and june 28 2014  was 34 million  and 05 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 27 2015  and june 28 2014  was 02 million  and 09 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of june 27 2015  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its amended and restated credit agreement including the term loan the 4250 senior notes and investments 

our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement including the term loan borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at coach’s option either a a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus an applicable margin or b an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 a hypothetical 10 change in the amended and restated credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an insignificant change in interest expense in fiscal 2015 furthermore we are also exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of our 6000 million  4250 senior notes at june 27 2015  the fair value of the 4250 senior notes was approximately 5790 million  

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective 

of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes

in fiscal 2014 we have reduced the number of both retail stores and total square footage as we continue to optimize our real estate position we expect this trend to accelerate in the next fiscal year with the anticipated closure of approximately 70 retail stores in fiscal 2015 attributable to our transformation plan as described in note 3 transformation restructuring and other related actions the number of coach retail stores and their total and average square footage remained relatively constant in fiscal 2013 when compared from fiscal 2012

coach’s outlet store design visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brands image through these outlet stores coach targets valueoriented customers 

the expansion in the number of north america coach outlet stores and their total and average square footage is shown in the following table

coach’s wide range of direct marketing activities includes email contacts and catalogs targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue in addition to building brand awareness the companys website serves as an effective brand communication vehicle by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors which drives store traffic and enables the collection of customer data 

as part of coachs direct marketing strategy the company uses its database primarily consisting of approximately 24 million households in north america and 10 million households in asia email contacts and direct mail pieces are coachs principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness the growing number of visitors to the companys ecommerce sites in the us canada japan and china provides an opportunity to increase the size of these databases 

in fiscal 2014  coach had informational websites in australia bahrain brazil chile colombia france hong kong indonesia ireland south korea kuwait malaysia mexico panama peru portugal saudi arabia singapore spain taiwan thailand uae united kingdom venezuela and vietnam in addition the company utilizes and continues to explore new technologies such as blogs and social networking websites including twitter facebook instagram pinterest wechat and sina weibo as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase online and store sales acquire new customers and build brand awareness

manufacturing 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including vietnam china the philippines india thailand italy hong kong and the united states coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets during fiscal 2014  the company had five vendors who each provided slightly over 10 of coach’s total units these five vendors are geographically dispersed and have multiple locations in different countries no other individual vendor currently provides more than approximately 10 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coachs high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

we maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing management offices in vietnam china hong kong and the philippines that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities over the last several years we have increased the presence of our senior management in the countries of our manufacturers to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

distribution 

in north america coach operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coachs distribution center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coachs products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers 

outside of north america the company has established regional distribution centers through thirdparties in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands the company also operates local distribution centers through thirdparties in japan china hong kong singapore taiwan malaysia and south korea 

information systems 

the foundation of coachs information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coachs transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is suitable for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a global platform for management reporting the supply chain management systems support sales procurement inventory planning and reporting functions in north america product fulfillment is facilitated by coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coachs internet business are supported by coach’s order management system internationally coach selectively relies on the warehouse and distribution systems owned by the thirdparties that operate certain of our international distributions centers additionally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality 

trademarks and patents 

coach owns all of the material worldwide trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products in addition it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with limited edition collaborative special 

projects coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach new york coach and horse  carriage design coach and story patch design coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design and op art c design and coach leatherware est 1941 the heritage logo coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coachs products are covered by design patents and a utility patent application coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them 

seasonality 

because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach experiences seasonal variations in its net sales operating cash flows and working capital requirements primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales including adverse weather conditions 

 government regulation 

most of coachs imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business however customs duties do represent a material part of total product cost to maximize opportunities coach operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements additionally the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide as a result coach is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its crossborder activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company’s products coach maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its importexport activity 

competition 

the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors this increased competition drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

employees 

as of june 28 2014  coach employed approximately 17200 people globally including both full and part time employees but excluding seasonal and temporary employees of these employees approximately 7300 and 7000 were full time and part time employees respectively in the global retail field approximately 60 of coach’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items 

our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment when disposable income is lower 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china europe and other international markets and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in south america in addition we have taken control of certain of our retail operations in europe and the asiapacific region including the united kingdom spain ireland portugal france and germany during calendar 2013 and malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012 we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries and in many of them we face established competitors many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront shortterm investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees 

consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

the successful execution of our multiyear transformation initiatives is key to the longterm growth of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth which will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan include i the future investment of approximately 500 million in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations ii the optimization of our north american store fleet including the closure of approximately 70 underperforming locations iii the realignment of inventory levels to reflect our elevated product strategy iv the investment of approximately 50 million in incremental advertising costs to further promote our new strategy and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence particularly within our outlet internet sales site the company believes that longterm growth can be realized through its transformational efforts over time however there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving longterm growth or changing the perception of coach from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3 transformation restructuring and other related actions for further information regarding the transformation plan 

if the execution of our transformation plan falls short our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products 

if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on destruction donation markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brand 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner 

we believe that the coach brand established almost 75 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brand with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing and retail environments that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted even if our products do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 34  of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

 we monitor our global foreign currency exposure in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada as well as coach’s cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars 

our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performance 

our business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that from time to time it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales 

we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operations we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business 

we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we maintain ecommerce sites in the us canada japan and china and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world additionally coach has informational websites in various countries as described in item i business lastly our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach outlet flash sale site given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems ii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our 

current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier selection guidelines we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website wwwcoachcom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply result in a substantial loss of inventory increase our costs disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores and if not remedied in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our business because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions hardware and system failures software viruses and security breaches we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida owned and operated by coach to support our growth in china and europe we established distribution centers in shanghai china and oldenzaal the netherlands owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan china hong kong singapore taiwan malaysia and south korea the warehousing of coach merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we do not own any of our retail store locations we lease our corporateowned stores under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years with renewal options typically in five year increments we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable and have similar renewal options generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option if we determine that it is no longer economic to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term for example in the fourth quarter of fy14 we announced that we will close approximately 70 retail stores in north america in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in part on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including key personnel 

the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting developing and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits employee morale our reputation recruitment by other employers perceived internal opportunities noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates our recently announced transformation plan and its attendant changes regarding organizational efficiencies may intensify this risk 

we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations in recent years we have experienced turnover of several senior management roles and we have focused time and resources on recruiting or promoting from within the new members of our current senior management team the continued turnover of senior management or the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain keyperson or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel 

our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry 

our wholesale business primarily consisting of the us wholesale business comprised approximately 5 of total net sales for fiscal 2014  continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business 

we currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for our footwear eyewear watches and fragrance products see item 1 — “ business — products ” where discussed further in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock 

because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in coach’s second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives 

we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities as a source of liquidity along with cash flows generated from our operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our noncurrent investments and other available financing options we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity to date we have not accessed the capital markets in a meaningful way and therefore are not currently rated by credit rating agencies our ability to access the capital markets in the future as a source of funding and the borrowing costs associated with such financing is dependent upon capital market conditions and our assigned credit rating and outlook 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of and relocation to our new global corporate headquarters 

the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company’s new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city the financing development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2014 the company invested 872 million in the hudson yards joint venture the company expects to invest approximately 350 million in the joint venture over the next two years with approximately 240 million estimated in fiscal 2015 depending on construction progress outside of the joint venture the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters in fiscal 2014 21 million was included in capital expenditures and we expect 188 million of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction the company’s allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand debtrelated borrowings and approximately 130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings 

due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature together with the fact that we are in the early stages of construction of the project certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project in addition the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations thus that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of or value of the building in which our new global headquarters will be located further our developer has financing construction and development obligations to parties other than us and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project 

the ownership of real property such as the new global corporate headquarters also subjects us to various other risks including among others 

 provisions in coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party 

coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board coach’s charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board 

risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts “hdrs” 

an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly 

we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected as a result the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach’s common stock on the nyse even allowing for currency differences 

the characteristics of the us capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different 

the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours trading characteristics including trading volume and liquidity trading and listing rules and investor bases including different levels of retail and institutional participation as a result of these differences the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same even allowing for currency differences fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the us capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs because of the different characteristics of the us and hong kong equity markets the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders 

nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company 

hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them 

if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs 

an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs 

our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be cancelled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period 

there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars 

the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document when used herein the terms “coach” “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to coach inc including consolidated subsidiaries 

executive overview 

coach is a leading new york design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle collections our product offerings include fine accessories gifts and certain seasonal lifestyle apparel collections for women and men 

coach operates in two segments north america and international the north america segment includes sales to north american customers through coachoperated stores including the internet and sales to north american wholesale customers the international segment includes sales to customers through coachoperated stores including the internet and concession shopinshops in japan and mainland china coachoperated stores and concession shopinshops in hong kong macau singapore taiwan malaysia south korea the united kingdom france ireland spain portugal germany and italy as well as sales to wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 35  countries as coach’s business model is based on multichannel global distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to drive growth within our global business we are focused on four key initiatives which directly align with the companys transformation plan described below 

 in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 coach announced a multiyear strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth which will enable the company to return to ‘bestinclass’ profitability this multifaceted multiyear transformation plan the transformation plan builds on the core brand equities of quality and craftsmanship with the aim of evolving our competitive value proposition we believe our strategy offers significant growth opportunities in handbags and accessories as well as in the broader set of lifestyle categories that we have operated in for some time but are less developed including footwear and outerwear this will require an integrated holistic approach across product stores and marketing and promotional activities it will also entail the rollout of carefully crafted aspirational marketing campaigns to define our brand to deliver a fuller and more consistent brand expression 

key operational and cost measures needed in order to fund and execute this plan include i the investment of approximately 500 million in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 ii the optimization of our north american store fleet including the closure of approximately 70 underperforming locations in fiscal 2015 iii the realignment of inventory levels to reflect our elevated product strategy in fiscal 2014 iv the investment of approximately 50 million in incremental advertising costs to further promote our new strategy starting in fiscal 2015 and v the significant scaleback of our promotional cadence particularly within our outlet internet sales site starting in fiscal 2014 the company believes that longterm growth can be realized through its transformational efforts over time for further discussion of charges incurred in connection with the transformation plan see items affecting comparability herein 

current trends and outlook 

in addition to the risks surrounding the successful execution of our transformation plan initiatives our outlook reflects a certain level of uncertainty despite signs of improvement in the global economy the global economic environment continues to negatively impact consumer confidence which in turn influences the level of spending on discretionary items consumer retail traffic remains relatively weak and inconsistent which has led to a more promotional environment due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion if the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile 

or worsens the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our trends in fiscal 2015 

we will continue to monitor these risks and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations while remaining focused on the longterm growth of our business and protecting the value of our brand 

for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations see part i item 1a  risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k

net income decreased in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to a decrease in operating income of 4044 million  partially offset by a 1452 million  decrease in our provision for income taxes net income per diluted share decreased due to lower net income excluding charges under our transformation plan in fiscal 2014 and restructuring and transformationrelated charges in fiscal 2013 net income decreased 185 and net income per diluted share decreased 169

net sales 

net sales decreased 53 or 2692 million  to 481 billion  excluding the effects of foreign currency net sales decreased 31 or 1559 million the decrease was driven by lower sales in the north america business partially offset by gains in the international business the following table presents net sales by reportable segment for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  





 comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions given our planned capital investments in connection with the transformation plan 

north america net sales  decreased 109  or  3777 million  to  310 billion  this decrease was primarily driven by lower comparable store sales of 4605 million or 15 largely due to lower traffic and lower wholesale sales of 261 million due to lower shipments the internet business had a negative impact of over 1 on comparable store sales which is attributable to the companys decision to eliminate thirdparty internet events and to limit access to our outlet internet sales site this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 1435 million related to net new stores since the end of fiscal 2013 coach opened a net 14 outlet stores including one men’s outlet store and closed a net 19 retail stores 

 international net sales  increased 55  or  861 million  to  164 billion  excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency primarily due to the japanese yen net sales increased 1910 million or 123 the increase in net sales was primarily due to double digit growth in china and asia excluding japan reflecting an increase of 1524 million due to net new stores and positive comparable store sales as well as a 405 million increase related to the acquisition of the europe joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 since fiscal 2013 excluding the impact of acquisitions we opened 39 net new stores with 34 net new stores in mainland china hong kong and macau and japan and five net new stores in the other regions the acquisition of the european joint venture resulted in a transfer of an additional 18 stores to the company’s direct control since the acquisition on july 1 2013 coach has also opened seven new stores and transitioned two stores from wholesale to direct control 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 108  or 4011 million to  330 billion  in fiscal 2014  from  370 billion  in fiscal 2013  gross margin for fiscal 2014  was 686  as compared to 729  in fiscal 2013  excluding items affecting comparability of 822 million in fiscal 2014 and 48 million in fiscal 2013 gross profit decreased 87  or 3237 million to 338 billion  from 370 billion in fiscal 2013 and gross margin was 703  in fiscal 2014 as compared to 730 in fiscal 2013

international gross profit increased 32  or 400  million to 130  billion in fiscal 2014  gross margin decreased 180  basis points from 806  in fiscal 2013  to 788  in fiscal 2014  the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the negative translation effect of changes in foreign currency primarily associated with fluctuations in the japanese yen other factors negatively impacting gross margin were increased promotions selling products with a higher average unit cost as well as increased penetration of our broadened lifestyle categories which were partially offset by the lower stepup of inventory as part of the purchase accounting related to our acquisitions 

corporate unallocated gross profit decreased 926 million from 647 million in fiscal 2013 to a loss of 279 million in fiscal 2014 excluding items affecting comparability of 822 million in fiscal 2014 and 48 million in fiscal 2013 gross profit decreased by 152 million from 695 million to 543 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to less favorable production variances 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses are comprised of four categories i selling ii advertising marketing and design iii distribution and customer service and iv administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation occupancy costs and supply costs wholesale and retail account administration compensation globally and coach international operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores open during any fiscal period and store performance as compensation and rent expenses vary with sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees primarily to support north america new product design costs public relations and market research expenses distribution and customer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for “corporate” functions including executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as corporate headquarters occupancy costs consulting and software expenses administrative expenses also include global equity compensation expense 

coach includes inbound productrelated transportation costs from our service providers within cost of sales coach similar to some companies includes certain transportationrelated costs related to our distribution network in selling general and administrative expenses rather than in cost of sales for this reason our gross margins may not be comparable to that of entities that include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 

sga expenses increased 02  or 33 million to 218  billion in fiscal 2014  as compared to 217  billion in fiscal 2013  primarily driven by an increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales sga expenses increased to 453  during fiscal 2014  as compared to 428  during fiscal 2013  excluding items affecting comparability of 493 million in fiscal 2014  and 484 million in fiscal 2013 sga expenses increased 24 million from fiscal 2013 and sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales to 443 in fiscal 2014 from 419 in fiscal 2013 

selling expenses were 155 billion or 322 of net sales in fiscal 2014  compared to 151 billion or 298 of net sales in fiscal 2013  the dollar increase in selling expenses reflected increases in new store openings in our international business including the impact of acquiring our former partner hackett’s 50 interest in our european joint venture these expenses were mostly offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to coach japan and lower expenses in north america due to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business 

advertising marketing and design costs were 2423 million or 50 of net sales in fiscal 2014  compared to 2654 million or 52 of net sales during fiscal 2013  the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business this decrease was partially offset by increased advertising marketing and design costs related to the company’s transformation efforts 

distribution and consumer service expenses of 872 million or 18 of net sales in fiscal 2014  were fairly consistent with fiscal 2013 expenses of 861 million or 17 of net sales

 north america operating income   decreased 203  or 2959 million  to 116 billion  in fiscal 2014 reflecting the decrease in gross profit of  3531  million which was partially offset by lower sga expenses of 572 million the decrease in sga expenses was related to the absence of costs in fiscal 2014 related to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business and lower variable selling costs as a result of lower sales operating margin decreased 450  basis points to 375  in fiscal 2014 from 420  during the same period in the prior year due to lower gross margin of 310 basis points and higher sga expense as a percentage of net sales of 140 basis points 

international operating income   decreased 46  or 265 million  to 5557 million  primarily reflecting higher sga expenses of 665 million partially offset by higher gross profit of 400 million  the increase in sga expenses is related to a 537 million increase in china and asia excluding japan related to higher occupancy and employee costs associated with new store openings and a 458 million increase as a result of the recently acquired europe business the increase in sga costs was offset by foreign currency effects in japan of 426 million operating margin decreased 360  basis points to 338  in fiscal 2014 from 374  during the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower gross margin of 180  basis points and higher overall selling expenses as a percentage of net sales which increased by 180 basis points

fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  items affecting comparability of our financial results 

nongaap measures 

the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with gaap the reported gross profit sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results including the impact of the fiscal 2014 transformation plan and fiscal 2013 restructuring and transformationrelated charges these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis for these fiscal years to exclude the impact of these items 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board used these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

additionally certain increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its international segment including coach japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance additionally we believe presenting certain increases and decreases that include and exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

for a detailed discussion on these nongaap measures see the results of operations section within item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items included in our reported results 





 

financial condition 

cash flows 



the company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased 4709  million in fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 1456  million in fiscal 2013 the yearoveryear change is primarily driven by declines in net cash provided by operations as well as an increase in net investments purchased during fiscal 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 4286  million primarily due to changes in our operating asset and liability balances and lower net income partially offset by higher noncash expenses other balance sheet changes which primarily relate to other assets were a use of cash of 642 million in fiscal 2014 due to an increase in tax receivables this compares to a 397 million source of cash in fiscal 2013 accrued liabilities were a lower source of cash in fiscal 2014 of 141 million as compared to a source of cash of 989 million in fiscal 2013 this was primarily driven by lower compensationrelated accruals at the end of fiscal 2014 accounts payable were a use of cash in fiscal 2014 of 302 million as compared to a source of cash of 304 million in fiscal 2013 driven by the timing of payments related to inventory purchases the increase in noncash expenses reflected higher transformation and restructuring charges and higher depreciation and amortization expenses partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and the yearoveryear change in the deferred income tax provision 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 7077  million in fiscal 2014  compared to 5705  million in fiscal 2013  with the increase of 1372  million primarily due to a net increase in our investment portfolio of 2263 million partially offset by a decline in cash used for acquisitions and related advances to distributors of 496 million 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 7480  million in fiscal 2014  or an increase of 589  million as compared to the prior fiscal year this net increase was primarily attributable to higher cash used of 1249 million related to common stock repurchases higher dividend payments of 368 million as result of an increased dividend rate per share and 318 million due to lower net proceeds from sharebased awards these increases were partially offset by net borrowings of 1400 million under the companys revolving credit facility 

revolving credit facilities 

on june 18 2012 the company established a 400 million revolving credit facility with certain lenders and jp morgan chase bank na as the primary lender and administrative agent the “jp morgan facility” with a maturity date of june 2017 on march 26 2013 the company amended the jp morgan facility to expand available aggregate revolving commitments to 700 million and to extend the maturity date to march 26 2018 the jp morgan facility is available to finance the seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes of the company and its subsidiaries at coach’s request and lenders’ consent revolving commitments of the jp morgan facility may be increased to 1 billion at june 28 2014  there was 1400 million outstanding under the jp morgan facility our average borrowings outstanding for fiscal 2014 was 939 million we had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding in fiscal 2013 

borrowings under the jp morgan facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at coach’s option either a a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus an applicable margin or b an alternate base rate which is a rate equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1 or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1 additionally coach pays a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the jp morgan facility at june 28 2014  the commitment fee was 9 basis points 

the jp morgan facility contains various covenants and customary events of default as of june 28 2014 no known events of default have occurred under the jp morgan facility 

coach japan maintains credit facilities with several japanese financial institutions to provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes with maximum borrowing capacity of 53 billion yen or approximately 52 million at june 28 2014  interest is based on the tokyo interbank rate plus a margin of 25 to 30 basis points at june 28 2014  and during fiscal 2014  there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 

coach shanghai limited maintains a credit facility to provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes with a maximum borrowing capacity of 630 million chinese renminbi or approximately 10 million at june 28 2014  interest is based on the peoples bank of china rate at june 28 2014  and during fiscal 2014  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 

both the coach japan and coach shanghai limited credit facilities can be terminated at any time by either party and there is no guarantee that they will be available to the company in future periods 

common stock repurchase program 

in october 2012 the company’s board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program to acquire up to 15 billion of coach’s outstanding common stock through june 2015 

purchases of coach common stock are made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases under maryland law coach’s state of incorporation treasury shares are not allowed as a result all repurchased shares are retired when acquired the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 

during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  the company repurchased and retired 102  million and 71  million shares respectively or 5249  million and 4000  million of common stock respectively at an average cost of 5127  and 5661  respectively as of june 28 2014  coach had 8367  million remaining in the stock repurchase program 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our noncurrent investments the 700 million available under our jp morgan facility the availability under our japan and shanghai credit facilities and other potential fixedfinancing options available to us in the credit and capital markets substantially all of our cash and shortterm investments are held outside the us in jurisdictions where we intend to permanently reinvest our undistributed earnings to support our continued growth we are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations we believe that our existing sources of liquidity including our ability to access credit and capital markets when needed will be sufficient to support our operating capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future our plans for further business expansion and transformationrelated initiatives 

we had 140 million in revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities as of june 28 2014  we will continue to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing for among other things funding our investment in the hudson yards joint venture our transformationrelated initiatives a material acquisition settlement of a material contingency including uncertain tax positions or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes this is expected to lead to increased outstanding debt during fiscal 2015 

we believe that our jp morgan facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of june 28 2014  there were nine financial institutions participating in the facility with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 16 we have no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

for the fiscal year ending june 27 2015 excluding expected capital expenditures related to the hudson yards joint venture of approximately 90 to 125 million which are in addition to our joint venture contributions the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 300 to 350 million capital expenditures will be primarily for capital investments in stores in north america and new stores in asia and europe to support our transformationrelated initiatives we will also continue to invest in department store and distributor locations and corporate infrastructure primarily technology 

because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach experiences seasonal variations in its net sales operating cash flows and working capital requirements primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates higher net sales and operating income especially during the holiday months of november and december fluctuations in net sales operating income and operating cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales such as adverse weather conditions 

in april 2013 the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies lp to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district the formation of the joint venture serves as a financing vehicle for the project with the company owning less than 43 of the joint venture upon completion of the office tower in fiscal 2016 the company 

will retain a condominium interest serving as its new corporate headquarters during fiscal 2014  the company invested 872 million in the joint venture the company expects to invest approximately 350 million over the next two years of which and depending on construction progress the company’s latest estimate contemplates an investment of approximately 240 million in fiscal 2015 outside of the joint venture coach is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters in fiscal 2014  21 million was included in capital expenditures and we expect an additional 188 million over the period of construction the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand debt and approximately 130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings expected in fiscal 2016 

management believes that cash flow from operations access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines on hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and dividend payments any future acquisitions or joint ventures and other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control 

contractual and other obligations 

firm commitments 

as of june 28 2014  coach’s contractual obligations are as follows 





 excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 1887 million as of june 28 2014 as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled if ever the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 28 2014  as these items will be paid within one year certain longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company’s pension plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the commitments included in the table above we have outstanding letters of credit 56 million as of june 28 2014  primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for insurance claims and valueadded tax refunds these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2015 

as discussed earlier the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies lp to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district in april 2013 the formation of the hudson yards joint venture serves as a financing vehicle for the project construction of the new building has commenced and upon completion of the office tower in fiscal 2016 coach will retain a condominium interest serving as its new corporate headquarters the hudson yards joint venture is determined to be a variable interest entity primarily due to the fact that it has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from its two  joint venture partners coach is not considered the primary beneficiary of the entity primarily because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance the company’s maximum loss exposure is limited to the committed capital 

we do not maintain any other offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 12 commitments and contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the companys financial statements actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity quality and mix of products in inventory consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions at june 28 2014  a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory excluding amounts associated with the transformation plan would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of sales in fiscal 2014 the company made a strategic decision to donate and destroy certain inventory items resulting in a charge to cost of sales of 822 million refer to note 3 transformation restructuring and other related actions for charges related to inventory under the companys transformation plan 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopinshop revenues are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction these revenues are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers internet revenue is also reduced by an estimate for returns 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns discounts and markdown allowances returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at june 28 2014  a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts markdowns and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed at which point revenue is recognized the company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote which is approximately two years after the gift card is issued and the company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property revenue associated with gift card breakage is not material to the company’s net operating results 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually the company has no finitelived intangible assets 

the company uses a quantitative goodwill impairment test which is a twostep process the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination in other words the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows market comparisons and recent transactions these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 

the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  or fiscal 2012  

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related asset group an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset similar to prior fiscal years when assessing store assets for impairment in fiscal 2014  the company analyzed the cash flows at an individual storebystore level which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 

in determining future cash flows we take various factors into account including changes in merchandising strategy the emphasis on retail store cost controls the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending the impacts of the experienced level of retail store managers the level of advertising promotional cadence and instore capital investments since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation 

the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

a hypothetical 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2014 net income by approximately 7 million 

income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including scheduled 

reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized 

the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars substantially all of coach’s purchases and sales involving international parties excluding international consumer sales are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its foreign operating subsidiaries’ us dollar denominated inventory purchases to mitigate such risk coach japan and coach canada enter into foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options as of june 28 2014  and june 29 2013  zerocost collar options designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 903 million  and 1934 million  respectively were outstanding as a result of the use of derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis as a result of the above considerations we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 28 2014 

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany and related party loans which are not long term in investment nature this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the hong kong dollar the south korean won the new taiwan dollar and the british pound sterling to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company entered into forward exchange and crosscurrency swap contracts the terms of which include the exchange of foreign currency fixed interest for us dollar fixed interest and an exchange of the foreign currency and us dollar based notional values at the maturity dates of the contracts the latest of which is november 2014 as of june 28 2014  and june 29 2013  the total notional values of outstanding forward exchange and crosscurrency swap contracts related to these loans were 132 million  and 1476 million  respectively 

the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 28 2014  and june 29 2013  was 05 million  and 45 million  respectively the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 28 2014  and june 29 2013  was 09 million  and 29 million  respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss as of june 28 2014  a 10 devaluation of the us dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values

these independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2013 approximately 69 of coachs total net sales were generated from newly introduced products with no sales in the same quarter the previous year 

our raw material suppliers independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coachs high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china vietnam india philippines thailand italy and the united states coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets during fiscal 2013 one vendor provided approximately 12 of coach’s total units no other individual vendor currently provides more than approximately 10 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales over the last several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

government regulation most of coachs imported products are subject to duties indirect taxes quotas and nontariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business however customs duties do represent a material part of total product cost to maximize opportunities coach operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements additionally the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide as a result coach is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its crossborder activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company’s products coach maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its importexport activity 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors this increased competition also drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china europe and other international markets and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in south america in addition we have recently taken control of certain of our retail operations in europe and the asiapacific region including the united kingdom spain ireland portugal france and germany during calendar 2013 and malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012 we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries and in many of them we face established competitors many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate and local reporting or legal requirements

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront shortterm investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees

we have recently undertaken a transformation to broaden coach’s brand identification from primarily accessories to instead being viewed as a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories we plan to achieve this by building upon our strong management and design teams and enhancing and building out the coach experience through expanded and new product categories enhanced retail environments and integrated marketing communications however there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in changing the perception of coach from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand consequently if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful our transformation falls short or we are unable to retain andor attract key personnel our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

 

 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner we believe that the coach brand established over 70 years ago is regarded as americas preeminent designer producer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service any misstep in product quality or design customer service marketing unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brand with our customers furthermore the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design production and styling of our products as well as create compelling marketing and retail environments that appeal to our customers our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted even if our products do meet changing customer preferences andor stay ahead of changing fashion trends our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 31 of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

     we monitor our global foreign currency exposure and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada as well as coach’s cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars 

 

 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operation we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

computer system disruption and cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees customers and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

in addition we maintain ecommerce sites in the us canada japan and china and have plans for additional ecommerce sites in other parts of the world in fiscal 2013 coach had informational websites in 28 countries lastly our ecommerce programs also include an invitationonly coach factory flash sale site and thirdparty flash sales sites given the robust nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our i computer hardware ii software systems ii customer marketing databases and iv ability to email our current and potential customers despite our preventative efforts our systems are vulnerable from timetotime to damage disruption or interruption from among other things physical damage natural disasters inadequate system capacity system issues security breaches email blocking lists computer viruses or power outages any 

 

 

material disruptions in our ecommerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

            while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier selection guidelines we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website coachcom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville florida owned and operated by coach to support our growth in china and the region in fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs we also operate distribution centers through thirdparties in japan china hong kong singapore taiwan malaysia korea and the netherlands the warehousing of coach merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could adversely affect our business and operations 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means 

 

 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin overall profitability and efficacy of our brand 

our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry our wholesale business consisting of the us wholesale business comprised approximately 5 of total net sales for fiscal 2013 continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel 

we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business we currently have multiyear agreements with licensing partners for our footwear sunwear watches and fragrance products see item 1 — “ business — products ” where discussed further in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience including risks associated with each licensing partner’s ability to obtain capital manage its labor relations maintain relationships with its suppliers manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and maintain customer relationships while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements further while we believe that we could replace out existing licensing partners if required our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in coach’s second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

 

 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price we are subject to income taxes in many us and foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

provisions in coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board coach’s charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board 

we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of and relocation to our new global corporate headquarters the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company’s new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city the financing development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in calendar 2015 during fiscal 2013 the company invested 939 million in the hudson yards joint venture the company expects to invest approximately 440 million in the joint venture over the next three years with approximately 130 million to 160 million estimated in fiscal 2014 depending on construction progress outside of the joint venture the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters in fiscal 2013 248 million was included in capital expenditures and we expect 190 million of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction the company’s allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand borrowings under its credit facility and approximately 130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings 

due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature together with the fact that we are in the early stages of construction of the project certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete 

 

 

the project in addition the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations thus that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of or value of the building in which our new global headquarters will be located further our developer has financing construction and development obligations to parties other than us and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project 

the ownership of real property such as the new global corporate headquarters also subjects us to various other risks including among others 

   risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts “hdrs” an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected as a result the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach’s common stock on the nyse even allowing for currency differences 

the characteristics of the us capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours trading characteristics including trading volume and liquidity trading and listing rules and investor bases including different levels of retail and institutional participation as a result of these differences the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same even allowing for currency differences fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the us capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs because of the different characteristics of the us and hong kong equity markets the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders nor 

 

 

the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

 

 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be cancelled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

 item 3 legal proceedings coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect coach’s intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within coach’s control and litigation with present or former employees 

as part of coach’s policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time coach files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent infringement trade dress infringement copyright infringement unfair competition trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time coach may have a number of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties 

although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive 

 

 

damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document when used herein the terms “coach” “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to coach inc including consolidated subsidiaries 

executive overview coach is a leading american design house of modern luxury accessories our product offerings include fine accessories and gifts for women and men including handbags men’s bags women’s and men’s small leather goods footwear outerwear watches weekend and travel accessories scarves sunwear fragrance jewelry and related accessories we are in the process of transforming coach from an international accessories business to a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories we plan to accomplish this strategy by building upon our strong management and design teams and enhancing and building out the coach experience through expanded and new product categories notably footwear and outerwear enhanced retail environments and integrated marketing communications 

coach operates in two segments north america and international the north america segment includes sales to north american consumers through coachoperated stores including internet sales and sales to wholesale customers and distributors the international segment includes sales to consumers through coachoperated stores in japan and mainland china including internet sales hong kong and macau singapore taiwan malaysia korea and sales to wholesale customers and distributors in 25 countries as coach’s business model is based on multichannel global distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global business we focus on three key growth strategies transformation to a lifestyle brand increased global distribution and improved store sales productivity to that end we are focused on four key initiatives 

    we believe the growth strategies described above will allow us to deliver longterm superior returns on our investments and increased cash flows from operating activities however intensified competition the promotional environment along with the current macroeconomic environment has created a challenging retail market the company believes strong longterm growth can be achieved through a combination of brand transformation including expanded product offerings additional distribution a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control with a strong balance sheet and significant cash position and a business model that generates significant cash flow we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholders

           on a nongaap basis the key metrics for fiscal 2013 were 

   

 

 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 



 

 

items affecting comparability the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the reported gross profit selling general and administrative expenses operating income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results as noted in the following tables refer to page 39 for a discussion on the nongaap measures 

coach inc   gaap to nongaap reconciliation for the years ended june 29 2013 and june 30 2012 in millions except per share data 





fiscal 2013 items restructuring and transformation in fiscal 2013 the company incurred restructuring and transformation related charges of 532 million the charges recorded in selling general and administrative expenses and cost of sales were 484 million and 48 million respectively the charges include the strategic reassessment of the reed krakoff business streamlining our organizational model and reassessing the fleet of our retail stores and inventories 

additional actions are expected to continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily related to the reed krakoff business 

fiscal 2012 items charitable contributions and tax adjustments during fiscal 2012 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 239 million primarily as a result of recording the effect of a revaluation of certain deferred tax asset balances due to a change in 

 

 

japan’s corporate tax laws and the favorable settlement of a multiyear transfer pricing agreement with japan the company used the net income favorability to contribute an aggregate 392 million to the coach foundation 

currency fluctuation effects the percentage increase in sales in fiscal 2013 for coach japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating these foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing these figures to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 

we believe that presenting coach japan sales increases including and excluding currency fluctuation effects will help investors and analysts to understand the effect on these valuable performance measures of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations 

net sales the following table presents net sales by reportable segment for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 



  comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from the internet coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 15 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening beginning in fiscal 2014 comparable store sales will not be adjusted for store expansions given our planned transformation related to capital investments

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board used these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance in addition we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies

we had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities as of june 29 2013 we may elect to draw on our credit facilities or other potential sources of financing for among other things a material acquisition settlement of a material contingency including uncertain tax positions or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development as well as for other general corporate business purposes 

we believe that our jp morgan facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution as of june 29 2013 there were nine financial institutions participating in the facility with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 16 we have no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future 

for the fiscal year ending june 28 2014 the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 280 million capital expenditures will be primarily for new stores in north america and asia to support our global expansion we will also continue to invest in department store and distributor locations and corporate infrastructure primarily technology these investments will be financed primarily from on hand cash and operating cash flows 

coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2013 coach purchased approximately 14 billion of inventory which was funded by on hand cash and operating cash flows

management believes that cash flow from operations on hand cash cash equivalents and its credit lines will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions or joint ventures and other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control

  the table above excludes the following amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 29 2013 as these items will be paid within one year longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company’s pension plans 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

investments longterm investments primarily consist of highcredit quality us and nonus issued corporate debt securities classified as availableforsale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income shortterm investments consist primarily of time deposits with original maturities greater than three months and with maturities within one year of balance sheet date dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 

investments in companies in which the company has significant influence but less than a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the company owns between 20 and 50 of the investee however other factors should be considered such as board representation and the rights to participate in the daytoday operations of the business 

additionally gaap requires the consolidation of all entities for which a company has a controlling voting interest and all variable interest entities “vies” for which a company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary an entity is generally a vie if it meets any of the following criteria i the entity has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties ii the equity investors cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or iii the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity or receive the expected returns of the entity and substantially all of the entity’s activities involve or are conducted on behalf of the investor with disproportionately few voting rights 

from time to time coach may make an investment that requires judgment in determining whether the entity is a vie if it is determined that the entity is a vie the company must assess whether it is the primary beneficiary 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at june 29 2013 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of sales 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

retail store and concessionbased shopwithinshop revenues are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction these revenues are recognized 

 

 

net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company’s ecommerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers internet revenue is also reduced by an estimate for returns 

wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns discounts and markdown allowances returns and allowances require preapproval from management and discounts are based on trade terms estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends actual and forecasted seasonal results an evaluation of current economic and market conditions retailer performance and in certain cases contractual terms the company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis the company’s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 

at june 29 2013 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed at which point revenue is recognized the company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote which is approximately two years after the gift card is issued and the company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property revenue associated with gift card breakage is not material to the company’s net operating results 

the company accounts for sales taxes and other related taxes on a net basis excluding such taxes from revenue 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually the company has no finitelived intangible assets 

the company uses a quantitative goodwill impairment test which is a twostep process the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is allocated in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows market comparisons and recent transactions these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 

the company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the third quarter of each fiscal year the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

 

 

valuation of longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related asset group an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset similar to prior fiscal years when assessing store assets for impairment in fiscal 2013 the company analyzed the cash flows at an individual storebystore level which is the lowest level for identifiable cash flows the company recorded impairment losses of 166 million in fiscal 2013 the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

in determining future cash flows we take various factors into account including changes in merchandising strategy the emphasis on retail store cost controls the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending the impacts of the experienced level of retail store managers and the level of advertising since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would have resulted in an insignificant change in fiscal 2013 sharebased compensation expense 

for stock options and share unit awards the company recognizes sharebased compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 

the company grants performancebased share awards to certain key executives the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the companys achievement of certain performance goals on a quarterly basis the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals and adjusts the sharebased compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods and include dividend equivalent shares if the performancebased award incorporates a market condition the grantdate fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model such as a monte carlo simulation 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making such determination we consider all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operation we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized in fiscal 2013 the company changed its policy for disclosure of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets whose realization is deemed remote from a net to a gross basis

in accordance with asc 74010 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical 

 

 

tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns and in specific cases the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coachs high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china italy united states vietnam hong kong india thailand philippines taiwan and peru coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets during fiscal 2012 one vendor provided approximately 16 of coach’s total units no other individual vendor currently provides more than approximately 11 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coachs distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coachs products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers 

to support our growth in china and the region in fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs the company also operates a distribution center through a thirdparty in japan 

 

 

management information systems the foundation of coachs information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coachs transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 continues to be the most current version available and is fully scalable to accommodate growth 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coachs internet business are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central erp system 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design coach op art design and the heritage logo coach leatherware est 1941  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coachs products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales over the last several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

government regulation most of coachs imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s 

 

 

wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors the company believes however that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company further believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinctive newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service 

employees as of june 30 2012 coach employed approximately 18000 people including both full and part time employees of these employees approximately 6200 and 8000 were full time and part time employees respectively in the retail field in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china taiwan singapore and korea approximately 70 of coach’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items the current uncertain global economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china and other international markets and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe in addition we have recently taken control of certain of our retail operations in the asiapacific region including taiwan malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012 we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries and in many of them we face established competitors many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate and local reporting or legal requirements 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate further such markets will have upfront shortterm investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the shortterm in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors 

 

 

which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 32 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

    we monitor our global foreign currency exposure and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases in japan and canada as well as coach’s cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio we cannot ensure however that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements additionally our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to us dollars if the us dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries’ foreign currencies the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operation we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

cyber security threats including a privacy or data security breach could damage our relationships with our customers harm our reputation expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business including corporate email communications to and from employees and stores the design manufacture and distribution of our finished goods digital marketing efforts collection and retention of customer data employee information the processing of credit card transactions online ecommerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space the possibility of a cyberattack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat as part of our business model we collect retain and transmit confidential information over public networks in addition to our own databases we use third party service providers to store process and transmit this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use 

 

 

reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems we also store all designs goods specifications projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks despite these efforts however we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events 

consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an alltime high any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered stored or used by us be it intentional or accidental could have a material impact on the operation of our business including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers employees and investors we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property lastly we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

           while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier selection guidelines we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor environmental or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website coachcom the violation of labor environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business we maintain three primary distribution centers a distribution center in jacksonville florida owned and operated by coach an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty and a distribution center through a thirdparty in japan see distribution section of item 1 business for further discussion the warehousing of 

 

 

coach merchandise store replenishment and processing directtocustomer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center’s operation could adversely affect our business and operations 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our overall profitability labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials or labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means these increasing costs of productions could also adversely affect our ability to achieve the gross margin objectives we have established 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated if that occurs we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our business 

our indirect segment could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry our indirect segment consisting of the us wholesale and coach international businesses comprised approximately 11 of total net sales for fiscal 2012 continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within our indirect segment 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in coach’s second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed our quarterly cash dividend is currently 030 per common share the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results 

 

 

of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations further proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

provisions in coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board coach’s charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board 

risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts “hdrs” an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected as a result the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach’s common stock on the nyse even allowing for currency differences 

the characteristics of the us capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours trading characteristics including trading volume and liquidity trading and listing rules and investor bases including different levels of retail and institutional participation as a result of these differences the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same even allowing for currency differences fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the us capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs because of the different characteristics of the us and hong kong equity markets the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs 

we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by us federal and maryland state laws and regulations we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to us federal and maryland laws and regulations us federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a 

 

 

number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong 

we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong the “sfc” that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence these codes will not apply to us we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong in addition we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied and been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc 

additionally if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our noncompliance with applicable undertakings for any reason additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance which could adversely affect us and hdr holders 

as the sfc does not have extraterritorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates 

furthermore prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware among other things that there are us federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders 

hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs the “hdr depositary” to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs the “deposit agreement” holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders’ meetings and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary or its nominee to exercise rights on their behalf in addition holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs 

holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them if we decide to undertake an equity offering that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering 

holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers including but not limited to the hdr depositary the registrar for the hdrs the custodian and any subcustodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock a failure by any of those service 

 

 

providers to meet their contractual obligations whether or not by culpable default could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian any subcustodian or the registrar hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited however coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary 

withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs our common stock is presently traded on the nyse any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock the relevant hdrs will be cancelled in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected 

the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock and vice versa might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded in addition the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay in addition there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock and vice versa will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate 

investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and us dollars the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the us dollarhong kong dollar exchange rate while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the us dollar using a specified trading band no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all

executive overview coach is a leading american marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men our product offerings include women’s and men’s bags accessories business cases footwear wearables jewelry sunwear travel bags watches and fragrance coach operates in two segments directtoconsumer and indirect the directtoconsumer segment includes sales to consumers through coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china taiwan singapore and the internet beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2013 this segment also includes coachoperated stores in malaysia and korea the indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries including the united states and royalties earned on licensed product as coach’s business model is based on multichannel international distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global framework we continue to focus on two key growth strategies increased global distribution with an emphasis on north america and china and improved store sales productivity to that end we are focused on four key initiatives 

    

 

 

 we believe the growth strategies described above will allow us to deliver longterm superior returns on our investments and drive increased cash flows from operating activities however the current macroeconomic environment while stabilizing has created a challenging retail market in which consumers notably in north america and japan are still cautious the company believes longterm growth can still be achieved through a combination of expanded distribution a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control our multichannel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses which reduces our reliance upon our fullprice us business with an essentially debtfree balance sheet and significant cash position we have a business model that generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends

sga expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan coach china coach singapore and coach taiwan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau mainland china taiwan and singapore open during any fiscal period advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations and market research expenses distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments corporate headquarters occupancy costs consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

coach similar to some companies includes certain costs related to our distribution network in selling general and administrative expenses rather than in cost of sales for this reason our gross margins may not be comparable to that of entities that include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 

during fiscal 2012 sga expenses increased 137 to 195 billion compared to 172 billion during fiscal 2011 excluding items affecting comparability of 392 million in fiscal 2012 and 257 million in fiscal 2011 sga expenses were 191 billion and 169 billion respectively as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 410 and 413 during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 402 and 407 respectively as we leveraged our selling expense base on higher sales 

selling expenses were 136 billion or 285 of net sales compared to 118 billion or 285 of net sales during fiscal 2011 the dollar increase in selling expenses was due to higher operating expenses in coach china and north american stores due to higher sales and new store openings coach japan operating expenses decreased by 04 million in constant currency but was more than offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately 152 million 

advertising marketing and design costs were 2452 million or 51 of net sales compared to 2244 million or 54 of net sales during fiscal 2011 the dollar increase was primarily due to marketing expenses related to consumer communications which includes our digital strategy through coachcom our global ecommerce sites thirdparty flash sites marketing sites and social networking the company operates marketing websites in 23 countries and utilizes social networking and blogs as costeffective consumer communication opportunities to increase online and store sales and build brand awareness also contributing to the increase were new design expenditures and development costs for new merchandising initiatives

257 million in fiscal 2011 expenses were 2430 million and 2267 million respectively representing 51 and 55 of net sales respectively the dollar increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount and systems investment largely due to our international expansion 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 310 in fiscal 2012 compared to 323 in fiscal 2011 during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 the company recorded the effect of a revaluation of certain deferred tax asset balances due to a change in japan’s corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multiyear transfer pricing agreement with japan also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the company recognized a favorable tax settlement as a result it made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the company decreased the provision for income taxes primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination excluding the benefit from these items affecting comparability the effective tax rate was 328 in fiscal 2012 and 336 in fiscal 2011 the decrease in the effective tax rate is also attributable to higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions in which income is earned due to the increased globalization of the company and a lower effective state tax rate 

net income net income was 104 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to 8808 million in fiscal 2011 the increase was due to the higher operating income and a reduction of the effective tax rate

the second half of fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region during fiscal 2011 the asia distribution center contributed to the increase in distribution and consumer service expenses however in the long run the company expects the asia distribution center to reduce costs as a percentage of net sales

fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 items affecting comparability of our financial results nongaap measures the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the reported sga expenses operating income and provision for income taxes in fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results similarly the reported sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes income from continuing operations net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis for these fiscal years to exclude the impact of these items 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board used these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance in addition we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance these items affecting comparability do not represent the company’s direct ongoing business operations by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

 

 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items included in our reported results 



fiscal 2012 items charitable contributions and tax adjustments during fiscal 2012 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 239 million primarily as a result of recording the effect of a revaluation of certain deferred tax asset balances due to a change in japan’s corporate tax laws and the favorable settlement of a multiyear transfer pricing agreement with japan the company used the net income favorability to contribute an aggregate 392 million to the coach foundation the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax adjustments and the resulting coach foundation funding needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated for fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2011 items charitable contributions and tax adjustments during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 155 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination the company used the net income favorability to contribute 209 million to the coach foundation and 400 million yen or 48 million to the japanese red cross society the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax adjustments and the resulting coach foundation funding and japanese red cross society contribution needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated and paid for fiscal 2011 

 

 

fiscal 2009 items cost savings measures during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the company recorded a charge of 134 million related to cost savings initiatives these initiatives included the elimination of approximately 150 positions from the company’s corporate offices in new york new jersey and jacksonville the closure of four underperforming retail stores and the closure of coach europe services the company’s samplemaking facility in italy prior to these cost savings measures in fiscal 2009 the company had no recent past history of similar elimination of positions closure of facilities or closure of underperforming stores during the stores’ lease terms 

charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 188 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination and other tax accounting adjustments the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement and adjustments were not related to the fiscal 2008 settlement the company used the net income favorability to contribute 150 million to the coach foundation the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated and paid for fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2008 items charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 606 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a tax return examination the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement were not related to the fiscal 2009 settlement the company used the net income favorability to create the coach foundation the company recorded an initial contribution to the coach foundation in the amount of 200 million the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the business operations as was done for executive management incentive compensation both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted 

variable expenses as a result of the lower income tax provision the company incurred additional incentive compensation expense of 121 million as a portion of the company’s incentive compensation plan is based on net income and earnings per share incremental incentive compensation driven by tax settlements of this magnitude is unlikely to recur in the near future as the company has modified its incentive compensation plans during fiscal 2009 to be measured exclusive of any unusual accounting adjustments the company believes excluding these variable expenses which were directly linked to the tax settlements assists investors in evaluating the company’s direct ongoing business operations 

currency fluctuation effects the percentage increase in sales and us dollar increases in operating expenses in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 for coach japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating these foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars and comparing these figures to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 

we believe that presenting coach japan sales and operating expense increases including and excluding currency fluctuation effects will help investors and analysts to understand the effect on these valuable performance measures of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations 

financial condition cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was 122 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to 103 billion in fiscal 2011 the increase of 1884 million was primarily due to the 1581 million increase in net income as well as the result of working capital changes between the two fiscal years the most significant of which

net cash used in financing activities was 7419 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to 8751 million in fiscal 2011 the decrease of 1332 million was primarily attributable to 3980 million less expended for common stock repurchases partially offset by 1924 million lower net proceeds from exercises of share based awards and 822 million higher dividend payments in fiscal 2012 due to the higher dividend payment rate

coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2012 coach purchased approximately 14 billion of inventory which was primarily funded by on hand cash and operating cash flows

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value as determined by management significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 74010 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable however in specific cases various tax authorities may take a contrary position a change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations for further information about income taxes see the income taxes note presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at june 30 2012 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related asset group an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company recorded an impairment loss in fiscal 2009 of 15 million related to the closure of three underperforming stores the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met 

revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption the company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed or remitted as escheatable property based on historical 

 

 

redemption patterns and escheatment laws and records such amounts as breakage revenue when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote which is approximately two years after the gift card is issued revenue associated with gift card breakage is not material to the company’s net operating results allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee at june 30 2012 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would have resulted in an insignificant change in fiscal 2012 sharebased compensation expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan and coach canada the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying 

 

 

terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars 

substantially all of coach’s fiscal 2012 nonlicensed product needs are purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states including china vietnam india philippines thailand italy taiwan peru malaysia columbia turkey and great britain additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding consumer sales at coach japan coach canada coach china coach singapore and coach taiwan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

in japan and canada coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from coach japan and coach canada’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases coach japan and coach canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options to manage these risks as of june 30 2012 and july 2 2011 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 3109 million and 1710 million respectively were outstanding 

coach had exposure to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its 650 million us dollardenominated fixed rate intercompany loan to manage this risk on december 29 2011 coach japan entered into a crosscurrency swap transaction the terms of which included an exchange of japanese yen fixed interest for us dollar fixed interest the loan and swap were settled at maturity in june 2012 at which point the swap required an exchange of japanese yen and us dollar based notional values 

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various crosscurrency intercompany and related party loans these loans are denominated in various foreign currencies with a total notional value of approximately 207 million as of june 30 2012 to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans the company entered into forward exchange and crosscurrency swap contracts the terms of which include the exchange of foreign currency fixed interest for us dollar fixed interest and an exchange of the foreign currency and us dollar based notional values at the maturity dates of the contracts the latest of which is june 2013

coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations which are denominated in japanese yen chinese renminbi hong kong dollar macanese pataca canadian dollar singapore dollar taiwan dollar malaysian ringgit korean won and the euro are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements

marketing coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising the coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing visual merchandising and public relations teams coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the marketplace prior to its introduction 

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels 

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising in fiscal 2011 consumer contacts increased 52 to over 625 million primarily driven by increased email communications the company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2011 were 750 million representing less than 2 of net sales

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns in support of its major selling seasons 

manufacturing while all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we nevertheless maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing and product development offices in hong kong china south korea india italy and vietnam that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities over the last several years we have increased the presence of our senior management at our manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

these independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2011 approximately 84 of coach’s total net sales were generated from 

 

 

products introduced within the fiscal year as the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china united states italy hong kong india thailand vietnam macau philippines turkey colombia malaysia mexico peru south africa and taiwan coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets no one vendor currently provides more than approximately 15 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers 

to support our growth in china and the region during the second half of fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs the company also operates a distribution center through a thirdparty in japan 

management information systems the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 and continues to be fully scalable to accommodate growth 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central erp system 

 

 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design coach op art design and the heritage logo coach leatherware est 1941  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales over the last several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

government regulation most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors the company believes however that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company further believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinctive newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items the current uncertain global economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability raw materials costs fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit and taxation consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe and to take control of certain of our retail operations in the asiapacific region we do not yet have significant experience operating in these countries and in many of them we face established competitors many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate and local reporting or legal requirements 

 

 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 30 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

    we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan and canada and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases as well as coach japan’s us dollardenominated intercompany loan we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any impact of foreign currency rate movements 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales we believe our trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anticounterfeiting efforts worldwide in spite of our efforts counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a thirdparty’s rights related to trademark copyright or patent this could adversely affect our future sales financial condition and results of operation we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal or other appropriate action we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses finally many countries’ laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws 

 

 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

           while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as our global operating principles andor supplier selection guidelines we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor or other business practices copies of our global business integrity program global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website coachcom the violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or suppliers’ labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products harm our trademarks or damage our reputation the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business 

increases in our costs such as raw materials labor or freight could negatively impact our overall profitability labor costs at many of our manufacturers has been increasing significantly and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials or labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means these increasing costs of productions could also adversely affect our ability to achieve the gross margin objectives we have established 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated if that occurs we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our business 

 

 

our indirect segment could suffer as a result of consolidations liquidations restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry our indirect segment consisting of the us wholesale and coach international businesses comprised approximately 13 of total net sales for fiscal 2011 continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of or concentrate the ownership of stores that carry our and our licensees’ products furthermore a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer whether motivated by competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within our indirect segment 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december poor sales in coach’s second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed our quarterly cash dividend is currently 0225 per common share the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations further there is proposed tax legislation that may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

provisions in coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party coach’s charter bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board coach’s charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

 

 

coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10 stockholder unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board

 item 3 legal proceedings coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect coach’s intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within coach’s control and litigation with present or former employees 

as part of coach’s policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time coach files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent 

 

 

infringement trade dress infringement trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time coach may have a number of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties 

although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts 

coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on coach’s business or consolidated financial statements 

coach has not entered into any transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose accordingly we have not been required to pay a penalty to the irs for failing to make disclosures required with respect to certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document when used herein the terms “coach” “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to coach inc including consolidated subsidiaries 

executive overview coach is a leading american marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men our product offerings include women’s and men’s bags accessories business cases footwear wearables jewelry sunwear travel bags watches and fragrance coach operates in two segments directtoconsumer and indirect the directtoconsumer segment includes sales to consumers through companyoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china the internet and coach catalog the indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries including the united states and royalties earned on licensed product as coach’s business model is based on multichannel international distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global framework we continue to focus on two key growth strategies increased global distribution with an emphasis on north america and china and improved store sales productivity to that end we are focused on five key initiatives 

     

 

 

we believe the growth strategies described above will allow us to deliver longterm superior returns on our investments and drive increased cash flows from operating activities however the current macroeconomic environment while stabilizing has created a challenging retail market in which consumers notably in north america and japan are still cautious the company believes longterm growth can still be achieved through a combination of expanded distribution a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control our multichannel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses which reduces our reliance upon our fullprice us business with an essentially debtfree balance sheet and significant cash position we believe we are well positioned to manage our business to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while returning cash to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends 

fiscal 2011 the key metrics of fiscal 2011 were 

         

 

 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 



 

 

directtoconsumer  — net sales increased 148 to 362 billion during fiscal 2011 from 316 billion during fiscal 2010 driven by sales increases in our companyoperated stores in north america and china net sales of fiscal 2010 included an additional week of sales which represented approximately 62 million 

comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from coachcom coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 150 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america net sales increased 144 driven by sales from new and expanded stores and by a 106 increase in comparable store sales during fiscal 2011 coach opened three net new retail stores and 22 new factory stores and expanded six factory stores in north america in japan net sales increased 51 driven by an approximately 698 million or 98 positive impact from foreign currency exchange during fiscal 2011 coach opened eight net new locations and expanded three locations in japan coach china results continued to be strong with doubledigit percentage growth in comparable store sales during fiscal 2011 coach opened 25 net new stores in hong kong and mainland china 

indirect  — net sales increased 188 to 5366 million from 4518 million in fiscal 2010 the increase was driven primarily by an 184 increase in coach international wholesale and us wholesale net revenue the net sales increase was partially offset by an additional week of sales in fiscal 2010 which represented approximately 8 million licensing revenue of approximately 247 million and 192 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 135 to 130 billion in fiscal 2011 as compared to 115 billion in fiscal 2010 excluding items affecting comparability of 257 million in fiscal 2011 operating income increased 157 to 133 billion operating margin decreased to 314 as compared to 319 in the prior year as gross margin decreased while selling general and administrative “sga” expenses slightly increased as a percentage of sales excluding items affecting comparability operating margin was 320 in fiscal 2011 

gross profit increased 148 to 302 billion in fiscal 2011 from 263 billion in fiscal 2010 gross margin was 727 in fiscal 2011 as compared to 730 during fiscal 2010 coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year 

sga expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan and coach china operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments corporate headquarters occupancy costs consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

during fiscal 2011 sga expenses increased 158 to 172 billion compared to 148 billion during fiscal 2010 excluding items affecting comparability of 257 million in fiscal 2011 sga expenses were 169 billion as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 413 and 411 during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2011 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 407 as we leveraged our selling expense base on higher sales 

 

 

selling expenses were 118 billion or 285 of net sales compared to 105 billion or 291 of net sales during fiscal 2010 the dollar increase in selling expenses was due to higher operating expenses in coach china and north american stores due to higher sales and new store openings additionally selling expenses of reed krakoff stores contributed to the dollar increase since the brand was not launched until the beginning of fiscal 2011 coach china and north american store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to operating efficiencies and sales leverage the decrease in coach japan operating expenses in constant currency of 102 million was offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately 335 million 

advertising marketing and design costs were 2244 million or 54 of net sales compared to 1794 million or 50 of net sales during fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to new design expenditures and development costs for new merchandising initiatives also contributing to the increase were marketing expenses related to consumer communications which includes our digital strategy through coachcom our global ecommerce sites marketing sites and social networking the company utilizes and continues to explore implementing new technologies such as our global web presence with informational websites in 17 countries social networking and blogs as costeffective consumer communication opportunities to increase online and store sales and build brand awareness 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 582 million or 14 of net sales compared to 480 million or 13 of net sales during fiscal 2010 to support our growth in china and the region during the second half of fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai owned and operated by a thirdparty allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region during fiscal 2011 the asia distribution center contributed to the increase in distribution and consumer service expenses however in the long run the company expects the asia distribution center to reduce costs as a percentage of net sales 

administrative expenses were 2524 million or 61 of net sales compared to 2040 million or 57 of net sales during fiscal 2010 excluding items affecting comparability of 257 million in fiscal 2011 expenses were 2267 million representing 55 of net sales the increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to higher sharebased and performancebased compensation 

interest income net net interest income was 10 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 80 million in fiscal 2010 the decrease is attributable to lower returns on our investments due to lower investment balances during the year 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 323 in fiscal 2011 compared to 365 in fiscal 2010 excluding the benefit from the items affecting comparability the effective tax rate was 336 in fiscal 2011 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination and higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions in which income is earned due to the increased globalization of the company and a lower effective state tax rate 

net income net income was 8808 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 7349 million in fiscal 2010 the increase was due to the higher operating income and a reduction of the effective tax rate 

 

 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 



directtoconsumer  — net sales increased 157 to 316 billion during fiscal 2010 from 273 billion during fiscal 2009 driven by sales increases in our companyoperated stores in north america and china the net sales increase was also driven by an additional week of sales which represented approximately 62 million 

comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from coachcom coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 150 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america net sales increased 161 driven by sales from new and expanded stores and by a 35 increase in comparable store sales during fiscal 2010 coach opened 12 net new retail stores and 10 net new factory stores and expanded five factory stores in north america in japan net sales increased 78 driven by an approximately 519 million or 78 positive impact from foreign currency exchange during fiscal 2010 coach opened six net new locations and expanded two locations in japan the remaining change in net sales is attributable to coach china primarily as a result of the full year impact of the acquisitions of our retail businesses in hong kong macau and mainland china new stores opened during fiscal 2010 and comparable store sales 

 

 

indirect  — net sales decreased 103 driven primarily by a 182 decrease in us wholesale as the company continued to control shipments into us department stores in order to manage customer inventory levels due to a weak sales environment the net sales decrease was partially offset by an additional week of sales which represented approximately 8 million we continue to experience better performance with international locations catering to indigenous consumers where the brand is gaining recognition whereas the company’s travel business has experienced weakness as it is heavily dependent on the japanese traveler licensing revenue of approximately 192 million and 195 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively is included in indirect sales

sga expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan and coach china operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments corporate headquarters occupancy costs and consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

during fiscal 2010 sga expenses increased 98 to 148 billion compared to 135 billion in fiscal 2009 excluding items affecting comparability of 284 million in fiscal 2009 sga expenses were 132 billion as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 411 and 418 during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2009 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 409 overall sga expenses increased primarily from higher administrative expenses driven by performancebased compensation and a prior year reversal of a straightline rent accrual resulting from the purchase of our corporate headquarters building that did not recur in fiscal 2010

coach japan operating expenses was driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately 220 million 

advertising marketing and design costs were 1794 million or 50 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 1636 million or 51 of net sales during fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to new design expenditures for the reed krakoff brand with expected introductions in fiscal year 2011 partly offset by controlled sample making expenses 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 480 million or 13 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 522 million or 16 in fiscal 2009 the decrease in expenses was primarily the result of fiscal 2009 cost savings initiatives and process improvements 

administrative expenses were 2040 million or 57 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 1534 million or 47 of net sales during fiscal 2009 excluding items affecting comparability of 234 in fiscal 2009 expenses were 1300 million representing 40 of net sales the increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to higher performancebased and sharebased compensation also during fiscal 2009 the company reversed straightline rent accruals resulting from the purchase of our corporate headquarters building during the lease period 

interest income net net interest income was 80 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 108 million in fiscal 2009 the decrease is attributable to lower returns on our investments due to lower interest rates 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 365 in fiscal 2010 compared to 366 in fiscal 2009 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company recorded a benefit of 188 million primarily related to favorable settlements of tax return examinations and certain other tax accounting adjustments excluding these benefits the effective tax rate was 385 in fiscal 2009

fiscal 2011 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 items affecting comparability of our financial results nongaap measures the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the reported sga expenses operating income and provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results similarly the reported sga expenses operating income provision for income taxes income from continuing operations net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis for these fiscal years to exclude the impact of these items 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board used these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance in addition we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance these items affecting comparability do not represent the company’s direct ongoing business operations by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

 

 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items included in our reported results 



fiscal 2011 items charitable contributions and tax adjustments during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 155 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination the company used the net income favorability to contribute 209 million to the coach foundation and 400 million yen or 48 million to the japanese red cross society the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax adjustments and the resulting coach foundation funding and japanese red cross society contribution needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation will be calculated for fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2009 items cost savings measures during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the company recorded a charge of 134 million related to cost savings initiatives these initiatives included the elimination of approximately 150 positions from the company’s corporate offices in new york new jersey and jacksonville the closure of four underperforming retail stores and the closure of coach europe services the company’s samplemaking facility in italy prior to these cost savings measures in fiscal 2009 the company had no recent past history of similar elimination of positions closure of facilities or closure of underperforming stores during the stores’ lease terms 

 

 

charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 188 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination and other tax accounting adjustments the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement and adjustments were not related to the fiscal 2008 settlement the company used the net income favorability to contribute 150 million to the coach foundation the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated and paid for fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2008 items charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 606 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a tax return examination the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement were not related to the fiscal 2009 settlement the company used the net income favorability to create the coach foundation the company recorded an initial contribution to the coach foundation in the amount of 200 million the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the business operations as was done for executive management incentive compensation both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted 

variable expenses as a result of the lower income tax provision the company incurred additional incentive compensation expense of 121 million as a portion of the company’s incentive compensation plan is based on net income and earnings per share incremental incentive compensation driven by tax settlements of this magnitude is unlikely to recur in the near future as the company has modified its incentive compensation plans during fiscal 2009 to be measured exclusive of any unusual accounting adjustments the company believes excluding these variable expenses which were directly linked to the tax settlements assists investors in evaluating the company’s direct ongoing business operations 

currency fluctuation effects percentage increases and decreases in sales in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 for coach japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreigndenominated sales into us dollars and comparing these figures to the same period in the prior fiscal year 

we believe that presenting coach japan sales increases and decreases including and excluding currency fluctuation effects will help investors and analysts to understand the effect on this valuable performance measure of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value as determined by management significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 74010 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable however in specific cases various tax authorities may take a contrary position a change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations for further information about income taxes see the income taxes note presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at july 2 2011 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company recorded an impairment loss in fiscal 2009 of 15 million related to the closure of three underperforming stores the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met 

revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption the company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee at july 2 2011 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

 

 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would result in an insignificant change in fiscal 2011 sharebased compensation expense 

recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards codification 82010 “ fair value measurements and disclosures ” “asc 82010” was amended in january 2010 to require additional disclosures related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements the guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons and the timing of the transfers and information on purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the guidance was effective for the company beginning on december 27 2009 except for certain disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements related to level 3 fair value measurements which were effective for the company beginning on january 2 2011 the disclosure guidance adopted on december 27 2009 and january 2 2011 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 asc 82010 was further amended to clarify certain disclosure requirements and improve consistency with international reporting standards this amendment is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the company beginning january 1 2012 the company does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

accounting standards codification topic 220 “ comprehensive income ” was amended in june 2011 to require entities to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendment does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income under current gaap this guidance is effective for the company’s fiscal year and interim periods beginning july 1 2012 the company is currently evaluating this guidance but does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan and coach canada the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

 

 

foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars 

substantially all of coach’s fiscal 2011 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china united states italy hong kong india thailand vietnam macau philippines turkey colombia malaysia mexico peru south africa and taiwan additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding consumer sales at coach japan coach canada and coach china are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

in japan and canada coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from coach japan and coach canada’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases coach japan and coach canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options to manage these risks as of july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 1710 million and 2486 million respectively were outstanding 

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its 1091 million us dollardenominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach to manage this risk on june 30 2011 coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction the terms of which include an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a us dollar fixed interest rate the loan matures on december 29 2011 at which point the swap requires an exchange of japanese yen and us dollar based notional values 

the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 was 20 million and 21 million respectively the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 was 17 million and 75 million respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates 

coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations which are denominated in japanese yen chinese renminbi hong kong dollar macau pataca and canadian dollars are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments revolving credit facilities and longterm debt 

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which identifies allowable investments specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes the company’s investment portfolio consists of us government and agency securities as well as corporate debt securities as the company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity investments are classified as heldtomaturity and stated at amortized cost except for auction rate securities which are classified as availableforsale at july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 the company’s investments classified as heldtomaturity consisted of commercial paper and treasury bills valued at 23 million and 999 million on those dates respectively as the adjusted book value of the commercial paper and treasury bills equals its fair value there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments at july 2 2011 the company’s investments classified as availableforsale consisted of a 60 million auction rate security at july 2 2011 as the auction rate securities’ adjusted book value equaled its fair value there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with this investment 

 

 

as of july 2 2011 the company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank of america facility its revolving credit facility maintained by coach japan and its revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited the fair value of any future borrowing may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 

as of july 2 2011 coach’s outstanding longterm debt including the current portion was 242 million a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coach’s approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coach’s licensing partners pay royalties to coach on their net sales of coach branded products however 

 

 

such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved 

marketing coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising the coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing visual merchandising and public relations teams coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the marketplace prior to its introduction 

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels 

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising in fiscal 2010 consumer contacts increased 139 to over 392 million primarily driven by increased email communications however the company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2010 were 61 million representing less than 2 of net sales

during fiscal 2010 coach launched informational websites in china south korea malaysia singapore france the united kingdom spain mexico and australia in addition the company utilizes and continues to explore new technologies such as blogs and social networking websites including twitter and facebook as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase online and store sales and build brand awareness 

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns in support of its major selling seasons 

manufacturing while all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we nevertheless maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing and product development offices in hong kong china south korea india and vietnam that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities over the last several years we have increased the presence of our senior management at our manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

 

 

these independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2010 approximately 74 of coach’s total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year as the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china united states italy hong kong india thailand vietnam peru philippines turkey ecuador great britain macau and malaysia coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets no one vendor currently provides more than approximately 10 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers

management information systems the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 and continues to be fully scalable to accommodate growth 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central erp system 

 

 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design coach op art design and the heritage logo coach leatherware est 1941  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales over the last several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

government regulation most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors the company believes however that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company further believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinctive newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the current uncertain economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

demand for our products is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to expand internationally our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

additionally our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions including asia and europe we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe and to take control of certain of our retail operations in the asiapacific region we do not yet have significant experience operating in these countries and in many of them we face established competitors many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate and local reporting or legal requirements 

 

 

furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 30 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

   to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan and canada through foreign currency hedging of our subsidiaries’ us dollardenominated inventory purchases as well as coach japan’s us dollardenominated intercompany loan we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn or a worsening of the current conditions in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

     

 

 

   while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed our quarterly cash dividend is currently 015 per common share the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors “board” may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated in addition our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations further there is proposed tax legislation that may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates 

provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board coach’s charter permits its board without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

 

 

on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board will be entitled to redeem the rights at 00001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2010 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan

executive overview coach is a leading american marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men our product offerings include handbags women’s and men’s accessories footwear jewelry wearables business cases sunwear travel bags fragrance and watches coach operates in two segments directtoconsumer and indirect the directtoconsumer segment includes sales to consumers through companyoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china the internet and coach catalog the indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries including the united states and royalties earned on licensed product as coach’s business model is based on multichannel international distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global framework we continue to focus on two key growth strategies increased global distribution with an emphasis on north america and china and improved store sales productivity to that end we are focused on five key initiatives 

     we believe the growth strategies described above will allow us to deliver longterm superior returns on our investments and drive increased cash flows from operating activities however the current macroeconomic environment while stabilizing has created a challenging retail market in which consumers notably in north america and japan are still cautious the company believes longterm growth can still be achieved through a combination of expanded distribution a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control our multichannel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses which reduces our reliance upon our fullprice us business with an essentially debtfree balance sheet and significant cash position we believe we are well positioned to manage our business to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while returning cash to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends

directtoconsumer  — net sales increased 157 to 316 billion during fiscal 2010 from 273 billion during fiscal 2009 driven by sales increases in our companyoperated stores in north america and china the net sales increase was also driven by an additional week of sales which represented approximately 62 million 

comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months and includes sales from coachcom coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 150 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america net sales increased 161 driven by sales from new and expanded stores and by a 35 increase in comparable store sales during fiscal 2010 coach opened 12 net new retail stores and 10 net new factory stores and expanded five factory stores in north america in japan net sales increased 78 driven by an approximately 519 million or 78 positive impact from foreign currency exchange during fiscal 2010 coach opened six net new locations and expanded two locations in japan the remaining change in net sales is attributable to coach china primarily as a result of the full year impact of the acquisitions of our retail businesses in hong kong macau and mainland china new stores opened during fiscal 2010 and comparable store sales 

indirect  — net sales decreased 103 driven primarily by a 182 decrease in us wholesale as the company continued to control shipments into us department stores in order to manage customer inventory levels due to a weak sales environment the net sales decrease was partially offset by an additional week of sales which represented approximately 8 million we continue to experience better performance with international locations catering to indigenous consumers where the brand is gaining recognition whereas the company’s travel business has experienced weakness as it is heavily dependent on the japanese traveler licensing revenue of approximately 192 million and 195 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 183 to 115 billion in fiscal 2010 as compared to 9719 million in fiscal 2009 excluding items affecting comparability of 284 million in fiscal 2009 operating income increased 150 from 100 billion operating margin increased to 319 as compared to 301 in the prior year as gross margin increased while selling general and administrative “sga” expenses declined as a percentage of sales excluding items affecting comparability operating margin was 310 in fiscal 2009 

gross profit increased 134 to 263 billion in fiscal 2010 from 232 billion in fiscal 2009 gross margin was 730 in fiscal 2010 as compared to 719 during fiscal 2009 the change in gross margin was driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs and product mix coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year 

sga expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan and coach china operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments corporate headquarters occupancy costs and consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base

selling expenses were 105 billion or 291 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 9815 million or 304 of net sales in fiscal 2009 excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2009 of 50 million related to the planned closure of four underperforming stores during the stores lease terms selling expenses were 9765 million representing 302 of net sales the dollar increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of north american stores and coach china the increase in north american store expenses was primarily attributable to expenses from new and expanded stores opened during fiscal 2010 and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year coach china and north american store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased primarily attributable to operating efficiencies achieved since the end of the fiscal 2009 the increase in coach japan operating expenses was driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately 220 million 

advertising marketing and design costs were 1794 million or 50 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 1636 million or 51 of net sales during fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to new design expenditures for the reed krakoff brand with expected introductions in fiscal year 2011 partly offset by controlled sample making expenses 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 480 million or 13 of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 522 million or 16 in fiscal 2009 the decrease in expenses was primarily the result of fiscal 2009 cost savings initiatives and process improvements

interest income net net interest income was 18 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 52 million in fiscal 2009 excluding items affecting comparability of 20 million in fiscal 2009 net interest income was 32 million the decrease is attributable to lower returns on our investments due to lower interest rates 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 362 in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company recorded a benefit of 168 million primarily related to favorable settlements of tax return examinations and certain other tax accounting adjustments excluding these benefits the effective tax rate was 380 in fiscal 2009

during fiscal 2009 sga expenses increased 72 to 135 billion compared to 126 billion in fiscal 2008 driven primarily by an increase in selling expenses partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 418 and 396 during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively excluding items affecting comparability of 284 million and 321 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively sga expenses were 132 billion and 123 billion respectively representing 409 and 386 of net sales respectively

advertising marketing and design costs were 1636 million or 51 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 1477 million or 46 of net sales during fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to design expenditures and development costs for new merchandising initiatives 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 522 million or 16 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 476 million or 15 in fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in fixed occupancy costs related to the expansion of our distribution center that was completed in august 2008 

administrative expenses were 1534 million or 47 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 1995 million or 63 of net sales during fiscal 2008 excluding items affecting comparability of 234 million and 321 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively expenses were 1300 million and 1674 million respectively representing 40 and 53 of net sales the decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in performancebased compensation expense and lower rent expense as a result of the purchase of our corporate headquarters building

fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 items affecting comparability of our financial results nongaap measures the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the reported sga expenses operating income interest income net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis for these fiscal years to exclude the impact of these items 

these nongaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected management and the company’s board utilized these nongaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources analyze performance between periods develop internal projections and measure management performance the company’s primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability in addition the compensation committee of the company’s board used these nongaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals 

we believe these nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s historical performance in addition we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance these items affecting comparability do not represent the company’s direct ongoing business operations by providing the nongaap measures as a supplement to gaap information we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations the nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures further these nongaap measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies 

 

 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items included in our reported results 



fiscal 2009 items cost savings measures during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the company recorded a charge of 134 million related to cost savings initiatives these initiatives included the elimination of approximately 150 positions from the company’s corporate offices in new york new jersey and jacksonville the closure of four underperforming retail stores and the closure of coach europe services the company’s samplemaking facility in italy prior to these cost savings measures in fiscal 2009 the company had no recent past history of similar elimination of positions closure of facilities or closure of underperforming stores during the stores’ lease terms 

charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 168 million and increased interest income by 20 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination and other tax accounting adjustments the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement and adjustments were not related to the fiscal 2008 settlement the company used the net income favorability to contribute 150 million to the coach foundation the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal ongoing business operations both the tax 

 

 

adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted this exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated and paid for fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2008 items charitable contribution and tax adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company decreased the provision for income taxes by 500 million and increased interest income by 107 million primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a tax return examination the underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement were not related to the fiscal 2009 settlement the company used the net income favorability to create the coach foundation the company recorded an initial contribution to the coach foundation in the amount of 200 million the company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the business operations as was done for executive management incentive compensation both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted 

variable expenses as a result of the higher interest income net related to the tax settlements and lower income tax provision the company incurred additional incentive compensation expense of 121 million as a portion of the company’s incentive compensation plan is based on net income and earnings per share incremental incentive compensation driven by tax settlements of this magnitude is unlikely to recur in the near future as the company has modified its incentive compensation plans during fiscal 2009 to be measured exclusive of any unusual accounting adjustments the company believes excluding these variable expenses which were directly linked to the tax settlements assists investors in evaluating the company’s direct ongoing business operations 

currency fluctuation effects percentage increases and decreases in sales in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 for coach japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreigndenominated sales into us dollars and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 

we believe that presenting coach japan sales increases and decreases including and excluding currency fluctuation effects will help investors and analysts to understand the effect on this valuable performance measure of significant yearoveryear currency fluctuations 

financial condition cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was 9909 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 8092 million in fiscal 2009 the increase of 1817 million was primarily due to the 1116 million increase in net income as well as working capital changes between the two periods the most significant of which occurred in accrued liabilities accounts payable and inventories accrued liabilities provided cash of 681 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a cash use of 321 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher bonus accruals in the current year as well as the nonrecurrence of a rent accrual reversal that occurred in fiscal 2009 in connection with the purchase of our corporate headquarters building accounts payable provided cash of 10 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a cash use of 370 million in fiscal 2009 due to timing of payments changes in inventory balances year over year resulted in a cash use of 339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to a cash source of 41 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher inventory levels at the current year end to support store expansion domestically and internationally 

net cash used in investing activities was 1822 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 2647 million in fiscal 2009 purchases of investments and proceeds from their maturities and sales resulted in a net cash outflow in fiscal 2010 of 999 million the company did not have similar investment activity in fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2009 the company used cash of 1033 million in connection with the purchase of its corporate headquarters building with no similar transaction occurring in fiscal 2010 additionally purchases of property and equipment were 559 million lower in the current fiscal year driven by the timing of certain projects 

 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 10199 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to 4401 million in fiscal 2009 the increase of 5798 million was primarily attributable to 6962 million of incremental common stock repurchases and 943 million of payments of company dividends partially offset by 1976 million higher cash proceeds from sharebased compensation awards during the current fiscal year

locations accounted for approximately 92 million of the total capital expenditures the remaining capital expenditures related to corporate systems and infrastructure these investments were financed from on hand cash operating cash flows and by using funds from the revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited 

for the fiscal year ending july 2 2011 the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 150 million capital expenditures will be primarily for new stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china we will also continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and department store and distributor locations these investments will be financed primarily from on hand cash and operating cash flows

management believes that cash flow from continuing operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures dividend payments and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value as determined by management significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 74010 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable however in specific cases various tax authorities may take a contrary position a change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations for further information about income taxes see the income taxes note presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at july 3 2010 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company recorded an impairment loss in fiscal 2009 of 15 million related to the closure of three underperforming stores the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2008 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met 

revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption the company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee at july 3 2010 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would result in an insignificant change in fiscal 2010 sharebased compensation expense

 licensing — in our licensing relationships coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the coach brand the current licensing relationships as of june 27 2009 are as follows 



products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coach’s approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coach’s licensing partners pay royalties to coach on their net sales of coach branded products however such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved 

marketing coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising the coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing visual merchandising and public relations teams coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the marketplace prior to its introduction 

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels 

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising in fiscal 2009 consumer contacts increased 14 to over 164 million however the company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2009 were 50 million representing less than 2 of net sales 

coach’s wide range of direct marketing activities includes email contacts catalogs and brochures targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue in addition to building brand awareness the 

 

 

coachcom website and the coach catalog serve as effective brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors which drive store traffic 

as part of coach’s direct marketing strategy it uses its database consisting of approximately 13 million active households in north america and 35 million active households in japan email contacts and catalogs are coach’s principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness during fiscal 2009 the company sent approximately 94 million emails to strategically selected customers as we continue to evolve our internet outreach to maximize productivity while streamlining distribution in fiscal 2009 the company distributed approximately 5 million catalogs in coach stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china the growing number of visitors to the coachcom websites in the us canada and japan provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases 

coach continues to explore new technologies such as blogs and social networking websites as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase online and store sales and build brand awareness 

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns in support of its major selling seasons 

manufacturing all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers however we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing and product development offices in hong kong china south korea and india that work closely with our independent manufacturers this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities over the last several years we have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

these independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2009 approximately 72 of coach’s total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year as the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware although coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china italy united states hong kong india thailand vietnam turkey philippines ecuador malaysia mauritius peru spain and taiwan coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets no one vendor currently provides more than approximately 10 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates an 850000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more 

 

 

accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers we expect that the facility’s current capacity will support the projected sales growth of the company over the next several years 

management information systems the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 and continues to be fully scalable to accommodate growth 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central erp system 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design and the heritage logo coach leatherware est 1941  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales over the last several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

government regulation most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign 

 

 

governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors however the company believes that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinctive newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the current economic crisis is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels unemployment consumer credit availability fuel and energy costs global factory production commercial real estate market conditions credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers 

 

 

demand for our products is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 28 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

   to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan through foreign currency hedging of coach japan’s us dollardenominated inventory purchases we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

  

 

 

      while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed our quarterly cash dividend is currently 0075 per common share the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited

 item 3 legal proceedings coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect coach’s intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within coach’s control and litigation with present or former employees 

as part of coach’s policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time coach files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent infringement trade dress infringement trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time coach may have a number of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties 

although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of usbased employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts 

coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on coach’s business or consolidated financial statements 

coach has not entered into any transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose accordingly we have not been required to pay a penalty to the irs for failing to make disclosures required with respect to certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 

executive overview coach is a leading american marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men our product offerings include handbags women’s and men’s accessories footwear jewelry wearables business cases sunwear travel bags fragrance and watches coach operates in two segments directtoconsumer and indirect the directtoconsumer segment includes sales to consumers through companyoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china the internet and coach catalog the indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries including the united states and royalties earned on licensed product as coach’s business model is based on multichannel international distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global framework we continue to focus on two key growth strategies increased global distribution with an emphasis on north america and china and improved store sales productivity to that end we are focused on four key initiatives 

    we believe the growth strategies outlined above will allow us to deliver longterm superior returns on our investments and drive increased cash flows from operating activities however the current macroeconomic environment has created a very challenging retail market in which it is difficult to achieve productivity gains the company believes longterm growth can still be achieved through a combination of expanded distribution a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control our multichannel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses which reduces our reliance upon our fullprice us business with an essentially debtfree balance sheet and significant cash position we believe we are well positioned to manage through this economic downturn

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 



in connection with the acquisitions of the retail businesses in hong kong macau and mainland china the company evaluated the composition of its reportable segments and concluded that sales in these regions should be included in the directtoconsumer segment accordingly fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 comparable sales have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

 

 

directtoconsumer  — net sales increased 66 to 273 billion during fiscal 2009 from 256 billion during fiscal 2008 driven by sales from new and expanded stores partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 150 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america net sales increased 54 as sales from new and expanded stores were partially offset by a 68 decline in comparable store sales and a decline in internet sales during fiscal 2009 coach opened 33 net new retail stores and nine net new factory stores and expanded 11 retail stores and nine factory stores in north america in japan net sales increased 111 driven by an approximately 702 million or 118 positive impact from foreign currency exchange during fiscal 2009 coach opened six net new locations and expanded three locations in japan the remaining change in net sales is attributable to coach china primarily as a result of the acquisitions of our retail businesses in hong kong macau and mainland china 

indirect  — net sales decreased 192 driven primarily by a 208 decrease in us wholesale as the company reduced shipments into us department stores in order to manage customer inventory levels due to a weaker sales environment international shipments also declined 67 as strong retail sales at locations targeting the domestic customer were offset by a decrease in retail sales at locations serving international tourists licensing revenue of approximately 195 million and 271 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income decreased 153 to 9719 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to 115 billion in fiscal 2008 excluding items affecting comparability of 284 million and 321 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively operating income decreased 152 to 100 billion in fiscal 2009 as compared to 118 billion in fiscal 2008 operating margin decreased to 301 as compared to 361 in the prior year as gross margin declined while selling general and administrative expenses increased excluding items affecting comparability operating margin was 310 and 371 in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively 

gross profit decreased 35 to 232 billion in fiscal 2009 from 241 billion in fiscal 2008 gross margin was 719 in fiscal 2009 as compared to 757 during fiscal 2008 the change in gross margin was driven primarily by promotional activities in coachoperated north american factory stores and channel mix gross margin was also negatively impacted by our sharper pricing initiative in which retail prices on handbags and women’s accessories have been reduced in response to consumers’ reluctance to spend and an increase in average unit cost coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan and coach china operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america japan hong kong macau and mainland china open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments corporate headquarters occupancy costs and consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 sga expenses increased 72 to 135 billion compared to 126 billion in fiscal 2008 driven primarily by an increase in selling expenses partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 418 and 396 during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively excluding items affecting comparability of 284 million and 321 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively sga expenses were 132 billion and 123 billion respectively representing 409 and 386 of net sales respectively

advertising marketing and design costs were 1636 million or 51 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 1477 million or 46 of net sales during fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to design expenditures and development costs for new merchandising initiatives 

distribution and consumer service expenses were 522 million or 16 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 476 million or 15 in fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in fixed occupancy costs related to the expansion of our distribution center that was completed in august 2008 

administrative expenses were 1534 million or 47 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 1995 million or 63 of net sales during fiscal 2008 excluding items affecting comparability of 234 million and 321 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively expenses were 1300 million and 1674 million respectively representing 40 and 53 of net sales the decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in performancebased compensation expense and lower rent expense as a result of the purchase of our corporate headquarters building

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 362 in fiscal 2009 compared to 345 in fiscal 2008 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 the company recorded a benefit of 168 million and 500 million respectively primarily related to favorable settlements of tax return examinations and certain other tax accounting adjustments excluding these benefits the effective tax rates were 380 and 390

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value as determined by management significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets in accordance with fin 48 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable however in specific cases various tax authorities may take a contrary position a change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations for further information about income taxes see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method prior to fiscal 2009 inventory of coach japan was determined by the lastin firstout method for further information about this change in accounting principle see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at june 27 2009 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company recorded an impairment loss in fiscal 2009 of 15 million related to the closure of three underperforming stores the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met 

 

 

revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption the company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee at june 27 2009 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option expected volatility and dividend yield the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company’s stock price changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would result in an insignificant change in fiscal 2009 sharebased compensation expense

us wholesale  — this channel offers access to coach products to consumers who prefer shopping at department stores coach products are also available on macyscom dillardscom and nordstromcom while overall us department store sales have not increased over the last few years the handbag and accessories category has grown in part due to the strength of the coach brand net sales shipments to us wholesale customers grew 16 in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 

coach recognizes the continued importance of us department stores as a distribution channel for premier accessories department stores also continue to devote increased square footage to coach providing an additional driver to this channel’s growth we continue to finetune our strategy to increase productivity and drive volume by enhancing presentation primarily through the creation of more shopinshops and the introduction of caseline enhancements with proprietary coach fixtures coach has also improved wholesale product planning and allocation processes by custom tailoring assortments to better match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market

the following table shows the number of international wholesale locations at which coach products are sold 



 licensing  — in our licensing relationships coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the coach brand the current licensing relationships as of june 28 2008 are as follows 



products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coachs approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coachs licensing partners pay royalties to coach on their net sales of coach branded products however such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved 

marketing coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising the coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing visual merchandising and public relations teams coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the marketplace prior to its introduction 

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels 

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising in fiscal 2008 consumer contacts increased 26 to over 144 million however the company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2008 were 57 million representing less than 2 of net sales 

coach’s wide range of direct marketing activities includes catalogs brochures and email contacts targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue in addition to building brand awareness the coach catalog and coachcom serve as effective brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors which drive store traffic 

as part of coachs direct marketing strategy it uses its database consisting of approximately 13 million active north american households and 3 million active japanese households catalogs and email contacts are coachs principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness the growing number of visitors to the coachcom websites in the us canada and japan provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases 

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns in support of its major selling seasons 

manufacturing all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers however we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing offices in hong kong china and south korea that work closely with our independent manufacturers coach also operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities we have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

these independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2008 approximately 68 of coachs total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year as the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coachs high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as coach has moved its production to external sources it has maintained control of the raw materials that are used in all of its products wherever they are made compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china india united states philippines mauritius italy spain turkey korea malaysia vietnam taiwan and thailand coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets no one vendor currently provides more than 15 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates a distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida during fiscal 2008 the distribution center was expanded to increase the facility’s shipping and storage capacities the expansion completed in august 2008 added 290000 square feet bringing the total square footage of the facility to 850000 this automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coachs distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers coachs products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers and direct to consumers via express delivery providers we expect that the facility’s increased capacity will support the projected sales growth of the company over the next several years 

management information systems the foundation of coachs information systems is its enterprise resource planning “erp” system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coachs transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 and continues to be fully scalable to accommodate growth 

complementing its erp system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coachs internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central erp system 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design signature c design and the heritage logo coach leatherware est 1941  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coachs products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue 

government regulation most of coachs imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown rapidly encouraging the entry of new competitors as 

well as increasing the competition from existing competitors however the company believes that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinct newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service 

employees as of june 28 2008 coach employed approximately 12000 people including both full and part time employees of these employees approximately 3700 and 6400 were full time and part time employees respectively in the retail field in north america and japan approximately 50 of coach’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 25 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

   to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan through foreign currency hedging of coach japan’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

       while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue

on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 00001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2008 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan

fiscal 2008 highlights during fiscal 2008 an increase in net sales continued to drive net income and earnings per share growth the highlights of fiscal 2008 were

the increase in interest income net and decrease in the provision for income taxes were primarily a result of a favorable settlement of a tax return examination as a result of the higher interest income net and lower income tax provision the company incurred an additional 121 million of incentive compensation as a portion of the company’s incentive compensation plan is based on net income and earnings per share finally the company took advantage of the onetime net income favorability to create the coach foundation the company recorded an initial contribution to the coach foundation in the amount of 200 million 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 



directtoconsumer  — net sales increased by 210 driven by increased sales from new stores comparable stores and expanded stores comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 150 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america net sales increased 220 driven by sales from new stores a 98 increase in comparable store sales and an increase in sales from expanded stores during fiscal 2008 coach opened 38 net new retail stores and nine new factory stores and expanded 18 retail stores and 19 factory stores in north america in japan net sales increased 234 driven primarily by sales from new and expanded stores coach japan’s reported net sales were positively impacted by approximately 44 million as a result of foreign currency exchange during fiscal 2008 coach opened 12 net new locations and expanded 11 locations in japan these sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the internet and direct marketing channels 

indirect  — net sales increased by 247 to 6367 million in fiscal 2008 from 5107 million in fiscal 2007 driven primarily by a 164 increase in sales in the us wholesale division and a 403 increase in sales in the international wholesale division licensing revenue of approximately 27 million and 15 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 155 to 115 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to 9934 million in fiscal 2007 driven by increases in net sales and gross profit partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses excluding onetime items of 321 million operating income increased 187 to 118 billion operating margin was 361 in fiscal 2008 compared to 380 in fiscal 2007 as gains from increased net sales were offset by a decrease in gross margin and increase in operating expenses excluding onetime items operating margin was 371 

gross profit increased 190 to 241 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to 202 billion in fiscal 2007 gross margin was 757 in fiscal 2008 compared to 774 in fiscal 2007 the change in gross margin was driven by promotional activities in coachoperated north american stores the fluctuation in foreign currency translation rates and channel mix coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses are comprised of four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coachoperated stores in north america and japan open during any fiscal period and the related 

proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as the number of coachoperated stores increase although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

during fiscal 2008 sga expenses increased 224 to 126 billion compared to 103 billion in fiscal 2007 driven primarily by increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 396 and 394 during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively excluding onetime costs of 321 million sga expenses were 123 billion representing 386 of net sales an improvement of 80 basis points over fiscal 2007 as we continue to leverage our expense base on higher sales 

the following table presents the components of sga expenses and the percentage of sales that each component represented for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 



the following table presents administrative expenses and total sga expenses and the percentage of sales that each represented for fiscal 2008 excluding onetime items of 321 million recorded in fiscal 2008 



the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of north america stores and coach japan the increase in north america store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year the increase in coach japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses the impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased reported expenses by approximately 192 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels 

the increase in advertising marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased expenses related to directmail marketing programs and increased staffing costs 

distribution and consumer service expenses decreased primarily due to efficiency gains partially offset by higher sales volume efficiency gains also led to an improvement in distribution and consumer service expenses as a percentage of net sales 

administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of 321 million of onetime charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 onetime charges consisted of a contribution to the newly created coach foundation of 200 million and 121 million of increased variable compensation expenses attributable to the increase in net income as a result of a onetime tax benefit discussed below excluding these onetime charges the increase in administrative expenses was driven by an increase in employee staffing costs including sharebased compensation expense and an increase in consulting and depreciation expenses as a result of investments in technology systems 

interest income net interest income net was 478 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to 413 million in fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily due to a reduction of 107 million of interest expense related to a onetime tax benefit discussed below excluding this benefit interest income net decreased primarily as a result of lower returns on our investments as a result of lower interest rates 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 345 in fiscal 2008 compared to 385 in fiscal 2007 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the company recorded a onetime benefit of 500 million primarily related to a favorable settlement of a tax return examination excluding this benefit the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was essentially flat as compared to the fiscal 2007 effective rate 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased 230 to 7830 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 6365 million in fiscal 2007 excluding onetime items of 410 million discussed above income from continuing operations was 7420 million a 166 increase over prior year the increase is primarily attributable to increased net sales as discussed above 

income from discontinued operations in march 2007 the company exited its corporate accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where coach product is sold through the corporate accounts business coach sold products primarily to distributors for giftgiving and incentive programs the results of the corporate accounts business previously included in the indirect segment have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 

in fiscal 2007 net sales and net income from discontinued operations were 665 million and 271 million respectively in fiscal 2008 net sales and net income from discontinued operations were not significant 

nongaap measures the company’s reported results are presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the reported selling general and administrative expenses operating income interest income net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations reflect certain onetime items recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 these metrics are also reported on a nongaap basis to exclude the impact of these onetime items the company believes these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company’s ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company’s prior guidance the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of us gaap financial measures

growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase these sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the direct marketing channel 

indirect  — net sales increased by 203 driven primarily by a 309 increase in the us wholesale division this sales increase was partially offset by a 46 decrease in net sales in the international wholesale division as shipments to our customers were curbed in consideration of slowing japanese travel trends in our markets and to ensure healthy inventory levels licensing revenue of approximately 15 million and 9 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 390 to 9934 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to 7147 million in fiscal 2006 driven by increases in net sales and gross profit partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses operating margin rose to 380 in fiscal 2007 from 351 in fiscal 2006 this 290 basis point improvement is attributable to increased net sales as discussed above and the leveraging of selling general and administrative expenses

the increase in advertising marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased staffing costs and design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories 

distribution and consumer service expenses increased primarily as result of higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and consumer service facility partially offset by an increase in our 

directtoconsumer shipments as a percentage of total shipments led to a decrease in distribution and consumer service expenses as a percentage of net sales 

the decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in sharebased compensation expense and other employee staffing costs however fiscal 2006 expenses were reduced by 20 million due to the receipt of business interruption proceeds related to our world trade center location the company did not receive any business interruption proceeds in fiscal 2007 

interest income net net interest income was 413 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 326 million in fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher returns on our investments as a result of higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rates tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value as determined by management significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets in accordance with fin 48 the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities periodically audit the company’s income tax returns management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable however in specific cases various tax authorities may take a contrary position a change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations for further information about income taxes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method except for inventories of coach japan for which cost is determined by the lastin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at june 28 2008 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option and expected volatility the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value however a 10 change in the blackscholes value would result in an insignificant change in fiscal 2008 sharebased compensation expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars 

substantially all of coach’s fiscal 2008 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china india philippines mauritius italy spain turkey korea malaysia vietnam taiwan and thailand additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

in japan coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of coach japan’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options to manage these risks the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months as of june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 2339 million and 1111 million respectively were outstanding 

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its 2310 million us dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach to manage this risk on july 1 2005 coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction the terms of which include an exchange of a us dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate the loan matures in 2010 at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and us dollar based principals 

the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 were 79 million and 233 million respectively the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities as june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 was 55 million and 0 respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates 

coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations which are denominated in japanese yen and canadian dollars are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments revolving credit facilities and longterm debt 

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which identifies allowable investments specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes the company’s investment portfolio consists of us government and agency securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities at june 28 2008 the company’s investments classified as availableforsale consisted of 80 million of auction rate securities as auction rate securities’ adjusted book value equals its fair value there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments 

as of june 28 2008 the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facilities however the fair value of any outstanding borrowings in the future may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 

as of june 28 2008 coach’s outstanding longterm debt including the current portion was 29 million a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

as part of coach’s direct marketing strategy it uses its database consisting of approximately 12 million active north american households catalogs and email contacts are coach’s principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness the rapidly growing number of visitors to the wwwcoachcom online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of this database 

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns primarily print and outdoor advertising in support of its major selling seasons 

manufacturing all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers however we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing offices in hong kong china and south korea that work closely with our independent manufacturers coach also operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities we have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized 

these independent manufacturers support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal 2007 approximately 73 of coach’s total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year as the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations our production quantities are limited which limits our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as coach has moved its production to external sources it has maintained control of the raw materials that are used in all of its products wherever they are made compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china the united states india hungary indonesia italy korea mauritius singapore spain taiwan and turkey no one vendor provides more than 13 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution coach operates a distribution and consumer service facility in jacksonville florida this automated 560000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via federal express and common carrier and direct to consumers via federal express 

management information systems the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth 

complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system 

trademarks and patents coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design coach and tag design and signature c design coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

coach’s trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them coach has no material patents 

seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue 

government regulation most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations 

competition the premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive the company mainly competes with european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers over the last several years the category has grown rapidly encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors however the company believes that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category 

the company believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors including but not limited to distinct newness innovation and quality of our products ability to meet consumer’s changing preferences and our superior customer service 

employees as of june 30 2007 coach employed approximately 10100 people including both full and part time employees of these employees approximately 3100 and 4900 were full time and part time employees respectively in the retail field in north america and japan approximately 50 of coach’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

we face risks associated with operating in international markets we operate on a global basis with approximately 24 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to 

   we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through foreign currency hedging of coach japan’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

       while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business 

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated 

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue

on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 00001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2007 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan

although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of usbased employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 

executive overview coach is a leading american marketer of fine accessories and gifts for men and women our product offerings include handbags women’s and men’s accessories footwear outerwear business cases sunwear watches travel bags jewelry and fragrance coach operates in two segments directtoconsumer and indirect the directtoconsumer segment includes sales to consumers through companyoperated stores in north america and japan the internet and coach catalogs the indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers in the us and asia as well as licensing revenue as coach’s business model is based on multichannel international distribution our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area 

in order to sustain growth within our global framework we continue to focus on two key growth strategies increased global distribution with an emphasis on our direct retail distribution in north america and japan and improved productivity to that end we are focused on four key initiatives 

    in addition to the strategies outlined above we continue to focus on improving our rate of profitability and delivering superior returns on investments by leveraging expenses our operating margin expansion will continue to outpace our sales growth which will drive increased cash flows from operating activities 

fiscal 2007 highlights during fiscal 2007 an increase in sales combined with an improvement in margins continued to drive net income and earnings per share growth the highlights of fiscal 2007 were 

    

     in march 2007 the company exited its corporate accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where coach product is sold through the corporate accounts business coach sold products primarily to distributors for giftgiving and incentive programs the results of the corporate accounts business previously included in the indirect segment have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 



directtoconsumer  — net sales increased by 305 driven by increased sales from comparable stores new stores and expanded stores comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 15 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base 

in north america comparable store sales growth sales from new stores and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 233 million 142 million and 31 million respectively of the net sales increase in japan sales from new stores comparable store sales growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 46 million 20 million and 8 million respectively of the net sales increase coach japan’s reported net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 12 million as a result of foreign currency exchange sales growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase these sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the direct marketing channel 

indirect  — net sales increased by 203 driven primarily by growth in the us wholesale division which contributed increased sales of approximately 73 million as compared to the prior year this sales increase was partially offset by an approximately 7 million decrease in net sales in the international wholesale division as shipments to our customers were curbed in consideration of slowing japanese travel trends in our markets and to ensure healthy inventory levels licensing revenue of approximately 15 million and 9 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 390 to 9934 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to 7147 million in fiscal 2006 driven by increases in net sales and gross profit partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses operating margin rose to 380 in fiscal 2007 from 351 in fiscal 2006 this 290 basis point improvement is attributable to increased net sales as discussed above and the leveraging of selling general and administrative expenses 

the following chart illustrates our operating margin performance over the last two years 



gross profit increased 279 to 20 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 16 billion in fiscal 2006 gross margin remained strong at 774 in fiscal 2007 compared to 777 in fiscal 2006 gross margin was negatively impacted by channel mix as coach japan grew more slowly than the business as a whole while our factory store channel grew faster as well as the fluctuation in currency translation rates however these negative impacts were partially offset by gains from product mix shifts reflecting increased penetration of higher margin collections and supply chain initiatives coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of 

factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses comprise four categories 1 selling 2 advertising marketing and design 3 distribution and consumer service and 4 administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coach and coach japan operated stores open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as consulting and software expenses sga expenses increase as coach and coach japan operate more stores although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of sga expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

during fiscal 2007 sga expenses increased 188 to 10 billion compared to 8669 million in fiscal 2006 driven primarily by increased selling expenses however as a percentage of net sales sga expenses decreased to 394 during fiscal 2007 compared to 426 during fiscal 2006 as we continue to leverage our expense base on higher sales 

the following table presents the components of sga expenses and the percentage of sales that each component represented for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 



the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of north america stores and coach japan the increase in north america store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year the increase in coach japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately 61 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels 

the increase in advertising marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased staffing costs and design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories 

distribution and consumer service expenses increased primarily as result of higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and consumer service facility partially offset by an increase in our directtoconsumer shipments as a percentage of total shipments led to a decrease in distribution and consumer service expenses as a percentage of net sales 

the decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in sharebased compensation expense and other employee staffing costs however fiscal 2006 expenses were reduced by 20 million due to the receipt of business interruption proceeds related to our world trade center location the company did not receive any business interruption proceeds in fiscal 2007 

interest income net net interest income was 413 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 326 million in fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher returns on our investments as a result of higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 385 in fiscal 2007 compared to 379 in fiscal 2006 this increase is primarily attributable to incremental income being taxed at higher rates 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 6365 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 4638 million in fiscal 2006 this 372 increase is attributable to increased net sales as well as significant operating margin improvement as discussed above 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was 271 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 304 million in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 net sales related to the corporate accounts business were 665 million compared to 764 million in fiscal 2006 the decrease in net sales and income is attributable to the exiting of the corporate accounts business during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 



net sales the following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 



directtoconsumer  — net sales increased 232 driven by increased sales from comparable stores new stores and expanded stores 

in north america comparable store sales growth sales from new stores and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 167 million 72 million and 13 million respectively of the net sales increase comparable store sales in north america rose 207 with retail stores up 123 and factory stores up 319 in japan sales from new stores comparable store sales growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 41 million 32 million and 11 million respectively of the net sales increase coach japan’s reported net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 35 million as a result of foreign currency exchange sales growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase these sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the direct marketing channel 

indirect  — net sales increased 233 driven by growth in the us wholesale and international wholesale divisions which contributed increased sales of approximately 45 million and 36 million respectively as compared to the prior year licensing revenue of approximately 9 million and 6 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively is included in indirect sales 

operating income operating income increased 334 to 7147 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 5357 million in fiscal 2005 driven by increases in net sales and gross profit partially offset by an increase in sga expenses operating margin rose to 351 in fiscal 2006 from 324 in fiscal 2005 this 270 basis point improvement is attributable to increased net sales as discussed above and the leveraging of sga expenses 

the following chart illustrates our operating margin performance over the last two years 



gross profit increased 248 to 16 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to 13 billion in fiscal 2005 gross margin increased 100 basis points to 777 in fiscal 2006 from 767 in fiscal 2005 as gains from supply chain initiatives and product mix shifts reflecting increased penetration of higher margin collections more than offset the impact of channel mix 

sga expenses increased 184 to 8669 million in fiscal 2006 from 7319 million in fiscal 2005 driven primarily by increased selling expenses however as a percentage of net sales sga expenses decreased to 426 as compared to 443 during fiscal 2005 as we continue to leverage our expense base on higher sales 

the following table presents the components of sga expenses and the percentage of net sales that each component represented for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 



the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of north america stores and coach japan the increase in north america store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year the increase in coach japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses however the impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately 16 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels 

the increase in advertising marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories 

distribution and consumer service expenses increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and consumer service facility resulted in an improvement in these expenses as a percentage of net sales 

the increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs and other employee staffing costs fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 expenses were reduced by 20 million and 26 million respectively due to the receipt of business interruption proceeds related to our world trade center location 

interest income net net interest income was 326 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 158 million in fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to higher returns on investments as a result of higher interest rates 

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate increased to 379 as compared to 365 in fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to the nonrecurrence of a one time benefit that the company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 related to the company’s buyout of sumitomo’s 50 interest in coach japan 

minority interest minority interest expense net of tax was 0 in fiscal 2006 compared to 136 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2005 the purchase of sumitomo’s 50 interest in coach japan on july 1 2005 eliminated minority interest as of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 4638 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 3366 million in fiscal 2005 this 378 increase is attributable to increased net sales as well as significant operating margin improvement as discussed above 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was 304 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 220 million in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 net sales related to the corporate accounts business were 764 million compared to 587 million in fiscal 2005 the company exited the corporate accounts business during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 

financial condition cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was 7791 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 5966 million in fiscal 2006 the 1825 million increase was primarily due to increased earnings of 1694 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations 

net cash used in investing activities was 3759 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 1810 million in fiscal 2006 the 1949 million increase in net cash used is attributable to a 1879 million increase in the net purchases of investments and a 70 million increase in capital expenditures related primarily to new and renovated retail stores in north america and japan coach’s future capital expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of our businesses new store openings store renovations and international expansion opportunities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 104 million in fiscal 2007 compared to a 4268 million use of cash in fiscal 2006 the change of 4372 million primarily resulted from a 4503 million decrease in funds expended to repurchase common stock in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 in addition there was a 256 million increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and a nonrecurrence of 123 million in repayments on the japanese credit facility in the prior year these increases were partially offset by a 342 million decrease in excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation and a 167 million decrease related to an adjustment to reverse a portion of the excess tax benefit previously recognized from sharebased compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

revolving credit facilities as of the end of fiscal 2007 the company maintained a 100 million unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders and bank of america na as primary lender and administrative agent the “bank of america facility” at coach’s request the bank of america facility was able to be expanded to 125 million coach paid a commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points on any unused amounts of the bank of america facility and interest of libor plus 45 to 100 basis points on any outstanding borrowings the initial commitment fee was 15 basis points and the initial libor margin was 625 basis points at june 30 2007 the commitment fee was 10 basis points and the libor margin was 45 basis points reflecting an improvement in our fixedcharge coverage ratio the facility was scheduled to expire on october 16 2007 

on july 26 2007 subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007 the company renewed the bank of america facility extending the facility expiration to july 26 2012 at coach’s request the renewed bank of america facility can be expanded to 200 million the facility can also be extended for two additional oneyear periods at coach’s request under the renewed bank of america facility coach will pay a commitment fee of 6 to 125 basis points on any unused amounts and interest of libor plus 20 to 55 basis points on any outstanding borrowings 

the bank of america facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 there were no borrowings under the bank of america facility accordingly as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings under the bank of america facility 

the bank of america facility contains various covenants and customary events of default coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception 

to provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes coach japan has available credit facilities with several japanese financial institutions these facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 74 billion yen or approximately 60 million at june 30 2007 interest is based on the tokyo interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points 

during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 the peak borrowings under the japanese credit facilities were 255 million and 216 million respectively as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings under the japanese credit facilities 

common stock repurchase program on october 20 2006 the coach board of directors approved an additional common stock repurchase program to acquire up to 500 million of coach’s outstanding common stock this authorization expires in june 2008 in connection with coach’s stock repurchase program purchases of coach stock may be made from time to time subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock become authorized but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 

during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 the company repurchased and retired 50 million and 191 million shares of common stock at an average cost of 2999 and 3150 per share respectively as of june 30 2007 500 million remained available for future repurchases under the existing program 

liquidity and capital resources in fiscal 2007 total capital expenditures were 1409 million in north america coach opened 41 new retail and seven net new factory stores and expanded six retail stores and seven factory stores these new and expanded stores accounted for approximately 70 million of the total capital expenditures in addition spending on department store renovations and distributor locations accounted for approximately 9 million of the total capital expenditures in japan we invested approximately 17 million primarily for the opening of 19 net new locations and nine store expansions the remaining capital expenditures related to corporate systems and infrastructure these investments were financed from on hand cash operating cash flows and by using funds from our japanese revolving credit facilities 

for the fiscal year ending june 28 2008 the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately 200 million capital expenditures will be primarily for new stores and expansions both in the us and in japan we expect to open approximately 40 new north american retail stores six new factory stores and 1520 new locations in japan while continuing to invest in department store and distributor locations in addition we will invest in corporate infrastructure and expand our jacksonville distribution center these investments will be financed primarily from on hand cash and operating cash flows 

coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2007 coach purchased approximately 663 million of inventory which was funded by on hand cash operating cash flow and by borrowings under the japanese revolving credit facilities 

management believes that cash flow from continuing operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control 

commitments at june 30 2007 the company had letters of credit available of 205 million of which 1156 million were outstanding these letters of credit which expire at various dates through 2012 primarily collateralize the company’s obligation to third parties for the purchase of inventory in addition 132 million relates to a letter of credit for the benefit of the sara lee corporation “sara lee” prior to coach’s spin off from sara lee sara lee was a guarantor or a party to many of coach’s leases coach has agreed to make efforts to 

remove sara lee from all of its existing leases and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee but for which sara lee retains contingent liability coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than 20 million the initial letter of credit had a face amount of 206 million and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced coach expects that it will be required to maintain the letter of credit for approximately 10 years 

contractual obligations as of june 30 2007 coach’s longterm contractual obligations are as follows 



  the table above excludes the following amounts included in current liabilities other than the current portion of longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet at june 30 2007 as these items will be paid within one year longterm liabilities not requiring cash payments such as deferred lease incentives and cash contributions for the company’s pension plans the company intends to contribute approximately 06 million to its pension plans during the next year 

coach does not have any offbalancesheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes the valuation of financial instruments that are markedtomarket are based upon independent thirdparty sources 

longterm debt coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville florida distribution and consumer service facility this loan has a remaining balance of 31 million and bears interest at 45 principal and interest payments are made semiannually with the final payment due in 2014 

seasonality because its products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect these trends to continue 

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the development and selection of the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventories the company’s inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties and are determined by the firstin firstout method except for inventories of coach japan for which cost is determined by the lastin firstout method the company reserves for slowmoving and aged inventory based on historical experience current product demand and expected future demand a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required at june 30 2007 a 10 change in the reserve for slowmoving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold 

goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 

longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business an impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 however as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met 

revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale internet and catalog channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption the company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee at june 30 2007 a 10 change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales 

sharebased compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grantdate fair value of those awards the grantdate fair value of stock option awards is determined using the blackscholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions including the expected term of the option and expected volatility the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock changes in the assumptions used to determine the blackscholes value could result in significant changes in the blackscholes value a 10 change in the blackscholes value would result in an insignificant change in fy07 sharebased compensation expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of 

derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars 

substantially all of coach’s fiscal 2007 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china india hungary indonesia italy korea mauritius singapore spain taiwan and turkey additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

in japan coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of coach japan’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily zerocost collar options to manage these risks the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 1111 million and 1148 million respectively were outstanding 

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its 231 million us dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach to manage this risk on july 1 2005 coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction the terms of which include an exchange of a us dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate the loan matures in 2010 at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and us dollar based principals 

the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 were 233 million and 26 million respectively the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates 

coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations which are denominated in japanese yen and canadian dollars are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments revolving credit facilities and longterm debt 

the company’s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company’s investment policy which identifies allowable investments specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk we do not hold any investments for trading purposes the company’s investment portfolio consists of us government and agency securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities as the company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity investments are classified as heldtomaturity and stated at amortized cost except for auction rate securities which are classified as availableforsale at june 30 2007 the company’s short term investments consisted of 6289 million of auction rate securities as auction rate securities’ market price equals its fair value there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments 

as of june 30 2007 the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facilities and the company does not expect to borrow against the facilities in the foreseeable future however the fair value of any outstanding borrowings in the future may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 

as of june 30 2007 coach’s outstanding longterm debt including the current portion was 31 million a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

coach offers a number of key differentiating elements that set it apart from the competitive landscape including

a distinctive brand – coach offers distinctive easily recognizable accessible luxury products that are relevant extremely wellmade and provide excellent value

a market leadership position with growing share – coach is america’s leading premium handbag and accessories brand and each year as our market share increases our leadership position strengthens

coach’s loyal and involved consumer – coach consumers have a specific emotional connection with the brand part of the company’s everyday mission is to cultivate consumer relationships by strengthening this emotional connection

multichannel international distribution –this allows coach to maintain a critical balance as results do not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area the direct channel provides us with immediate controlled access to consumers through coachowned stores in north america and japan the internet and catalogs the indirect channel provides us with access to consumers via us and international wholesale customers

coach is innovative and consumercentric – coach listens to its consumer through rigorous consumer research and strong customer orientation coach works to anticipate the consumer’s changing needs by keeping the product assortment fresh and relevant

coach believes that these differentiating elements have enabled the company to offer a unique proposition to the marketplace  we hold the number one position within the us premium handbags and accessories market and the number two position within the japanese imported luxury handbags and accessories market

growth strategies

in order to continue to expand our market share globally coach is pursuing two key growth strategies first increased global distribution with an emphasis on our direct retail distribution in north america and japan and second improving productivity

increased global distribution – the potential for distribution growth is significant in north america and japan as well as in emerging markets our primary focus is the expansion of coach’s north american retail store base given the continued doubledigit growth of the premium handbag and accessory category in the us over the next three years we plan to add about 100 north american retail stores bringing the store base to over 300 stores we believe that north america including canada can over the next several years support approximately 400 stores in addition we will continue to expand select highly productive retail and factory locations in japan we are continuing to aggressively expand market share with the consumer primarily through distribution including new stores and expansions utilizing a similar multichannel distribution model that we have established in the us based on our analysis and the regional market opportunity we have just begun to realize we estimate that japan can support at least 180 coach locations

in addition to our two core markets the us and japan the asian region represents an excellent growth opportunity as we partner with local distributors to grow coach’s presence in this area today there are over 75 locations in asia excluding japan with the largest markets being korea and taiwan where the emerging middle class along with the japanese tourists have created very attractive opportunities for us we are also focused on hong kong as the gateway to greater china we have begun to establish a presence in mainland china through two pilot stores in beijing and shanghai and expect to open at least ten new locations over the next two to three years on the mainland

improving productivity – by leveraging our unique position as an accessible luxury lifestyle brand we are building share in the rapidly growing north american women’s accessories market and in the japanese accessories market there are four initiatives we have undertaken to maximize productivity

intensify awareness as a yearround gift resource we are intensifying awareness as a yearround gift resource by offering a variety of products at a broader range of prices providing perfect options for all giftgiving holidays we continue to offer a wide assortment of products at competitive price points as well as a full range of accessories at sharp price points including wristlets agendas ipod cases sunglasses cell phone lanyards and charms

develop underpenetrated categories and emphasize new usage occasions we are expanding our core collections and developing underpenetrated categories such as business totes weekend casual evening and baby bags we continue to introduce product for new usage occasions such as business totes weekend casual and evening to address voids in our offerings we strive to understand what our customers want and what they need to suit their lifestyle needs everyday we work hard to have product that is both fashionable and functional and by doing this we gain an even greater presence in our customers’ accessory wardrobe and give the coach shopper additional reasons to visit and repurchase

tiered merchandise strategy we introduced this strategy into our stores three years ago offering more sophisticated product in limited quantities in our flagship and fashion locations while maintaining our core assortment in the greater number of coach stores today the balance has shifted as fashion locations represent the majority of our stores we have elevated our customers’ expectations regarding product and found additional opportunities to graduate stores we are experiencing significantly higher limited edition penetration along with driving units per transaction by offering a broader assortment of addon items and potential new categories we believe that opportunity still remains to graduate stores from core to fashion and fashion to flagship

enhance level of service in stores at coach we want to be as wellknown for excellent service as we are for great product great service builds loyalty and loyalty drives sales while we pride ourselves on today’s service levels we realize that a programmatic approach reinforced by training and performance standards will enhance the coach shopping experience the store service initiative is twofold first we are expanding our instore marketing program making it easier for our customers 

to shop coach by special request which we introduced two years ago allows our customers to preorder product or purchase styles that are not available when they visit a particular store all on an automated system and have them shipped directly to their home second we are elevating the level of customer service in our stores we continue to evolve our coach service programs focusing on additional opportunities to deliver consistent customer service through new tools and initiatives this past year through our smart scheduling initiative overall labor hours were invested to deliver more consistent customer service the success of this initiative was demonstrated in our fiscal 2006 results as we were able to maintain conversion rates in full price stores on higher traffic and improve conversion in the factory stores

segments

coach operates in two reportable segments directtoconsumer and indirect the reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar products service and marketing strategies see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for segment financial information

directtoconsumer segment 

the directtoconsumer segment consists of channels that provide us with immediate controlled access to consumers retail stores and factory stores in north america and japan the internet and catalogs this segment represented approximately 76 of coachs total net sales in fiscal 2006 with north american stores and coach japan contributing approximately 54 and 20 of total net sales respectively

north american retail stores our stores are sophisticated modern and inviting they showcase the world of coach and enhance the shopping experience while reinforcing the image of the coach brand coach stores are located in upscale regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas our flagship stores which offer the broadest assortment of coach products are located in highvisibility locations such as new york chicago and san francisco the following table shows the number of coach retail stores and their total and average square footage

 

the retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size and location the modern store design creates a distinctive environment that showcases these various products store associates are trained to maintain high standards of visual presentation merchandising and customer service the result is a complete statement of the coach modern american style at the retail level

north american factory stores coachs factory stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufacturedforfactorystore product including factory exclusives as well as discontinued and irregular inventory outside the retail channel these stores operate under the coach factory name and are geographically positioned primarily in established centers that are generally more than 50

miles from major markets the following table shows the number of coach factory stores and their total and average square footage

 

coach’s factory store design visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brands image through these factory stores coach targets valueoriented customers who would not otherwise buy the coach brand prices are generally discounted from 10 to 50 below full retail prices

coach japan inc coach japan operates department store shopinshop locations as well as freestanding flagship retail and factory stores flagship stores which offer the broadest assortment of coach products are located in select shopping districts of japan the following table shows the number of coach japan locations and their total and average square footage

 

internet coach views its website as a key communications vehicle for the brand to promote traffic in coach retail stores and department store locations and build brand awareness our internet business has grown to be significant generating net sales of approximately 54 million in fiscal 2006 the growth in the internet business is driven by the strength of the overall coach brand as well as advertising and email contacts in fiscal 2006 there were approximately 40 million unique visitors to the website in addition the company sent approximately 55 million emails to strategically selected customers in fiscal 2006 like coach catalogs the online store provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a selected offering of the latest styles and colors revenue from internet sales is recognized upon shipment of the product

catalog in fiscal 2006 the company distributed approximately 76 million catalogs in coach stores in north america and japan and mailed approximately 41 million catalogs to strategically selected us households from its database of customers while direct mail sales comprise a small portion of coachs net sales coach views its catalog as a key communications vehicle for the brand because it promotes store traffic facilitates the shopping experience in coach retail stores and builds brand awareness as an integral component of our communications strategy the graphics models and photography are upscale and modern and present the product in an environment consistent with the coach brand position the catalogs highlight selected products and serve as a reference for customers whether ordering through the catalog making instore purchases or purchasing over the internet

indirect segment 

coach began as a us wholesaler to department stores and this segment remains important to our overall consumer reach today we work closely with our partners both domestic and international to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation the indirect channel represented approximately 24 of total net sales in fiscal 2006 with us wholesale and international wholesale representing approximately 11 and 7 of total net sales respectively

us wholesale this channel offers consumers who prefer shopping at department stores or who live in geographic areas that are currently not large enough to support a coach retail store access to coach products while overall us department store sales have been lackluster the last few years the handbag and accessory category within this channel has remained strong in large part due to the strength of coach therefore the department stores continue to devote increased square footage to coach providing an additional driver to this channel’s growth

coach recognizes the continued importance of us department stores as a distribution channel for premier accessories we continue to finetune our strategy to increase productivity and drive volume by enhancing presentation primarily through the creation of more shopinshops and the introduction of caseline enhancements with proprietary coach fixtures while exiting lower performing doors and working with the department stores to reallocate their coach spending to higher volume locations coach has also improved the wholesale product planning and allocation processes and custom tailors assortments to better match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market net sales to us wholesale customers grew 23 in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 coachs products are sold in approximately 900 us wholesale locations our most significant us wholesale customers are federated department stores including macys bloomingdales lord and taylor marshall fields and filene’s dillards nordstrom and saks inc including saks fifth avenue and parisian store closures resulting from the recent federated department stores and may co merger did not have a significant impact on coach’s us wholesale business

international wholesale this channel represents sales to international wholesale distributors and authorized retailers within the international arena the largest portion of sales is currently the traveling japanese consumer however we continue to drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in emerging markets coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who market coach products through department stores freestanding retail locations and specialty retailers in 18 countries coachs current network of international distributors serves markets such as korea the united states primarily hawaii and guam hong kong taiwan singapore japan saudi arabia australia mexico thailand malaysia the caribbean china new zealand and france for locations not in freestanding stores coach has created shopinshops and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth coach continues to improve productivity in this channel by opening larger imageenhancing locations expanding existing stores and closing smaller less productive stores coachs most significant international wholesale customers are the dfs group lotte group shilla group tasa meng corp and imaginex

the following table shows the number of international wholesale locations at which coach products are sold

 

business to business as part of the indirect channel of distribution coach sells products to corporations and distributors for incentive and giftgiving programs

licensing in our licensing relationships coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the coach brand the current licensing relationships as of july 1 2006 are as follows

 

products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coachs approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coachs licensing partners pay royalties to coach on their net sales of coach branded products however such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved

marketing 

coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising the coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing visual merchandising and public relations teams coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the marketplace prior to its introduction

in conjunction with promoting a consistent global image coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels

coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives including direct marketing activities and national regional and local advertising in fiscal 2006 consumer contacts increased 16 to over 100 million however the company continues to leverage marketing expenses total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2006 were 36 million representing less than 2 of net sales

coach’s wide range of direct marketing activities includes catalogs brochures and email contacts targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue in addition to building brand awareness coach catalogs and wwwcoachcom serve as effective brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors which drives store traffic

as part of coachs direct marketing strategy it uses its database consisting of approximately 97 million active us households catalogs and email contacts are coachs principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness the rapidly growing number of visitors to the wwwcoachcom online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of this database

the company also runs national regional and local advertising campaigns primarily print and outdoor advertising in support of its major selling seasons

manufacturing

all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers however we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture we are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing offices in hong kong china and south korea that work closely with our independent manufacturers coach also operates a european sourcing and 

product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities we have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized

these independent manufacturers can support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new more fashion oriented styles which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences during fiscal year 2006 approximately 70 of coachs total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year at the same time by designating a significant number of the new styles as ‘‘limited editions’’ that are planned to be offered for a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products we help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory

all product sources including independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain coachs high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as coach has moved its production to external sources it has maintained control of the raw materials that are used in all of its products wherever they are made compliance with quality control standards is monitored through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities

coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of ‘‘better brand’’ partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery our manufacturers are located in many countries including china hungary india italy korea philippines singapore spain taiwan thailand and turkey no one vendor provides more than 15 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards

distribution

coach operates a distribution consumer service and repair facility in jacksonville florida this automated 560000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coachs distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers coachs products are primarily shipped to coach retail stores and wholesale customers via federal express and common carrier and direct to consumers via federal express

during 2006 the jacksonville facility was redesigned without increasing the building’s square footage to increase storage and processing capacity this redesign will enable us to maximize the storage capacity of the building and also increase processing capability and output per associate we expect that the facility’s increased capacity can support the projected sales growth of the company during the next few years

management information systems 

the foundation of coachs information systems is its enterprise resource planning system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coachs transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth

complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports corporate sales and inventory functions creating a monthly demand plan 

and reconciling productionprocurement with financial plans product fulfillment is facilitated by coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coachs internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system

trademarks and patents 

coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design and coach and tag design and it has applications pending for a proprietary ‘‘c’’ signature fabric design  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coachs products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world

coachs trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date coach has no material patents

 item 1a risk factors

you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see ‘‘special note on forwardlooking information’’ at the beginning of this report the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the risks below actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer 

the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful design and introduction of new products our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate our competitors include private label retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers as well as other well known handbags and accessories companies there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors which could harm our business our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability

we face risks associated with operating in international markets 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 25 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us however sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in us dollars while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country we are subject to risks associated with international operations including but not limited to

   we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through foreign currency hedging of coach japan’s us dollar denominated inventory purchases we cannot ensure however that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements

a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business 

many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer 

purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities 

as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to

       while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business

our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products 

if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated

our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock 

because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue

provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its ‘‘poison pill’’ may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party 

coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders

on may 3 2001 coach declared a ‘‘poison pill’’ dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited 

exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 00001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2006 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan

coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board of directors coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board of directors coach’s board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements

fiscal 2006 vs fiscal 2005

results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 are as follows

 

operating income 

operating income increased 335 to 7646 million in 2006 as compared to 5726 million in 2005 this increase was driven by increases in net sales and gross profit offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses

the following chart illustrates our operating margin performance over the last two years

 

the increase in operating margin is attributable to higher sales and gross profit as well as the leveraging of selling general and administrative expenses

net sales 

in fiscal 2006 net sales increased 234 to 21 billion compared to 17 billion in fiscal 2005 the net sales increase was driven by growth across all distribution channels as a result of coach’s acquisition of sumitomo’s 50 interest in coach japan on july 1 2005 the company reevaluated the composition of its reportable segments and determined that coach japan should be a component of the directtoconsumer segment previously coach japan was included in the indirect segment all prior period information has been reclassified to include coach japan as a component of the directtoconsumer segment

net sales by operating segment in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 are as follows

 

direct net sales increased 232 to 16 billion during fiscal 2006 from 13 billion during fiscal 2005 driven by increased sales from comparable stores new stores and expanded stores coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by 15 or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base

in north america comparable store sales growth sales from new stores and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 167 million 72 million and 13 million respectively of the net sales increase in japan sales from new stores comparable store sales growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately 41 million 32 million and 11 million respectively of the net sales increase coach japan’s reported net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 35 million as a result of foreign currency exchange sales growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase these sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a slight decline in the direct marketing channel

indirect net sales increased 243 to 5008 million in fiscal 2006 from 4030 million during fiscal 2005 this increase was driven by growth in the us wholesale international wholesale and businesstobusiness divisions which contributed increased sales of approximately 45 million 36 million and 18 million respectively as compared to the prior year licensing revenue of approximately 9 million and 6 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively is included in indirect sales

gross profit 

gross profit increased 250 to 16 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to 13 billion in fiscal 2005 gross margin increased 100 basis points to 776 in fiscal 2006 from 766 in fiscal 2005 as gains from supply chain initiatives and product mix shifts reflecting increased penetration of higher margin collections more than offset the impact of channel mix coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses comprise four categories selling advertising marketing and design distribution and customer service and administrative selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coach and coach japan operated stores open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and customer service expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as consulting and software expenses selling general and administrative expenses increase as coach and coach japan operate more stores although an 

increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of selling general and administrative expenses being spread over a larger sales base

selling general and administrative expenses increased 184 to 8743 million in fiscal 2006 from 7382 million in fiscal 2005 driven primarily by selling expenses during fiscal 2006 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 414 as compared to 432 during fiscal 2005 this improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales

selling expenses increased 170 to 5819 million or 276 of net sales in fiscal 2006 from 4973 million or 291 of net sales in fiscal 2005 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of north america stores and coach japan the increase in north america store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year the increase in coach japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately 16 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels

advertising marketing and design costs increased by 277 to 1006 million or 48 of net sales in fiscal 2006 from 788 million or 46 of net sales in fiscal 2005 this dollar increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories

administrative expenses increased 188 to 1488 million or 70 of net sales in fiscal 2006 from 1252 million or 73 of net sales in fiscal 2005 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs and other employee staffing costs included as a reduction to administrative expenses are business interruption proceeds of 20 million related to our world trade center location

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate increased to 380 as compared to the 367 rate recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to the nonrecurrence of a one time benefit that the company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 related to the company’s buyout of sumitomo’s 50 interest in coach japan

minority interest 

minority interest expense net of tax was 0 in fiscal 2006 compared to 136 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2005 the purchase of sumitomo’s 50 interest in coach japan on july 1 2005 eliminated minority interest as of the first quarter of fiscal 2006

management believes that cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control

prior to coach’s spin off from the sara lee corporation ‘‘sara lee’’ sara lee was a guarantor or a party to many of coach’s leases coach has agreed to make efforts to remove sara lee from all of its existing leases and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee but for which sara lee retains contingent liability coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than 20 million the initial letter of credit had a face amount of 206 million and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced as of july 1 2006 the letter of credit was 151 million we expect that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for approximately 10 years

as of july 1 2006 the scheduled maturities of coach’s longterm contractual obligations are as follows

 

coach does not have any offbalancesheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes the valuation of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent thirdparty sources

longterm debt 

coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville florida distribution and consumer service facility this loan has a remaining balance of 33 million and bears interest at 45 principal and interest payments are made semiannually with the final payment due in 2014

seasonality 

because its products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which 

includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect these trends to continue

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements

the areas of accounting that involve significant judgments and estimates are inventories sharebased compensation impairment of long lived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and revenue recognition in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policy that involves the selection of an alternative method is accounting for inventories for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements

inventories 

us inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined by the firstin firstout method or market inventories in japan are valued at the lower of cost determined by the lastin firstout method or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties reserves for slowmoving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand we evaluate the adequacy of reserves quarterly a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slowmoving and aged merchandise

sharebased compensation 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards ‘‘sfas’’ 123r ‘‘sharebased payment’’ which requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award previously the company accounted for stockbased compensation plans and the employee stock purchase plan in accordance with apb opinion 25 ‘‘accounting for stock issued to employees’’ and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas 123 ‘‘accounting for stockbased compensation’’ the company elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method as provided by sfas 123r and accordingly all financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the cost of such awards based on the grantdate fair value of the awards

the determination of the grantdate fair value of the awards involves several assumptions including expected term of the option and future volatility the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach’s stock

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which are separately tested for impairment are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment in order to complete our impairment analysis we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004

revenue recognition 

sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale internet and catalog channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported net sales from the licensee

 item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when 

appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates

foreign exchange 

foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues and expenses translated into us dollars

substantially all of coach’s fiscal 2006 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china hungary india italy korea philippines singapore spain taiwan thailand and turkey additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not hedged by coach using any derivative instruments

coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollar denominated inventory purchases coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these risks these transactions are in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes

coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its 231 million us dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach to manage this risk on july 1 2005 coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction the terms of which include an exchange of a us dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate the loan matures in 2010 at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and us dollar based principals

the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 18 months the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 were 26 million and 15 million respectively as of july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 1148 million and 469 million were fair valued for the year ended july 1 2006 changes in derivative balances resulted in a reduction of other comprehensive income of 45 million net of taxes for the year ended july 2 2005 changes in derivative balances resulted in an increase of other comprehensive income of 12 million net of taxes

interest rate 

coach faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of 33 million at july 1 2006 a hypothetical 1 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

  licensing in our licensing relationships coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the coach brand the current licensing relationships as of july 2 2005 are as follows 

   products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coach’s approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coach’s licensing partners pay royalties to coach on their net sales of coach branded products however such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved 

9 manufacturing 

  during the past several years in coordination with the repositioning of its brand coach has refined its production capabilities by shifting its production from owned domestic facilities to independent manufacturers in lower cost markets these independent manufacturers can support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new more fashion oriented styles during fiscal year 2005 approximately 65 of coach’s total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year at the same time by designating a significant number of the new styles as “limited editions” that are planned to be offered for a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products we help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 

  coach developed a flexible manufacturing model that meets shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences it uses two main sources to make coach products outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its licensing partners all product sources must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as coach moved its production to external sources it has maintained control of the raw materials that are used in all of its products wherever they are made compliance is monitored with the quality control standards through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities 

  all of coach’s fiscal year 2005 product requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers coach buys independently manufactured products from many countries including china hong kong italy india singapore south korea spain turkey costa rica hungary indonesia thailand taiwan and philippines coach operates sourcing offices in hong kong china and south korea that work closely with our sourced vendors coach also operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery no one vendor provides more than 16 of coach’s total units before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards 

distribution 

  coach operates a warehousing distribution and repair facility in jacksonville florida this computerized 560000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld optical scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped via federal express and common carrier to coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via federal express direct to consumers 

management information systems 

  the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth 

  complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is well suited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports corporate sales and inventory functions creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling productionprocurement with financial plans product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of 

10 coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system 

trademarks and patents 

  coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design and coach and tag design and it has applications pending for a proprietary “c” signature fabric design coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world 

  coach’s trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date coach has no material patents 

employees 

  as of july 2 2005 coach employed approximately 5700 people about 50 of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements of the total 3600 are engaged in retail selling and administration positions 400 are engaged in sourcing or distribution functions and 1000 are employed through coach japan the remaining employees are engaged in other aspects of the coach business coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or significant work stoppage 

government regulation 

  most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations

11 risk factors 

  you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” on page 2 

if coach is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business its future operating results could suffer 

  successful implementation of coach’s strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth to manage growth effectively coach will need to continue to increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict quality control coach will also need to continue to improve its operating systems to respond to any increased demand it could suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its products do not continue to meet its quality control standards or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in consumer demand for its products 

coach’s inability to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner could adversely affect its sales 

  coach’s success depends on its ability to identify originate and define product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner its products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change coach cannot assure that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future 

if coach misjudges the demand for its products it may incur increased costs due to excess inventories 

  if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated 

competition in the markets in which coach operates is intense and our competitors may develop products that are more popular with consumers 

  coach faces intense competition in the product lines and markets in which it operates coach’s products compete with other brands of products within their product category and with private label products sold by retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers in its wholesale business coach competes with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of handbags accessories and other products for the limited space available for the display of these products to the consumer moreover the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which coach operates which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its competitive position and business finally some of coach’s competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names 

a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items which could adversely affect coach’s sales 

  many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales 

12 coach’s gross profit may decrease if it becomes unable to obtain its products from or sell its products in other countries due to adverse international events that are beyond its control 

  in order to lower its sourcing costs and increase its gross profit coach has shifted its production to independent nonus manufacturers in lowercost markets coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments limits on production capacity changes in local economic conditions and trade issues these factors among others could influence the ability of these independent manufacturers to make or export coach products costeffectively or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these products the violation of labor or other laws by any of coach’s independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical by coach or others in the us could damage coach’s reputation and force it to locate alternative manufacturing sources currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of raw materials or labor for these independent manufacturers which they could pass along to coach resulting in higher costs and decreased margins for its products if any of these factors were to render a particular country undesirable or impractical as a source of supply there could be an adverse effect on coach’s business including its gross profit 

  coach’s failure to continue to increase sales of its products in international markets could adversely affect its gross profit international sales are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations foreign consumer preferences political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments to other nations tourism and changes in local economic conditions these factors among others could influence coach’s ability to sell products successfully in international markets coach generally purchases products from international manufacturers in us dollars and sells these products in the us and to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however coach’s international wholesale customers sell coach products in the relevant local currencies and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international consumer demand 

coach’s business is subject to foreign exchange risk 

  coach sells products to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however those distributors sell coach product in the relevant local currency currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international demand 

  the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollar denominated inventory purchases in order to manage this risk coach japan enters into forward exchange contracts that allow them to obtain dollars at a rate that is set concurrent with the requisition of inventory these contracts meet the definition of a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as these contracts are entered into before the receipt of inventory the contract rate may be higher or lower than market rates when the goods are received and the payment is completed all contracts are fair valued at the end of each reporting period if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge effective subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged items affect earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately this noncash charge or credit can result in fluctuations in the reported financial results 

  coach consolidates the financial results of coach japan into its financial statements the functional currency of coach japan is the japanese yen operating results are converted to us dollars based on the average exchange rate during the period and the balance sheet is converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period 

if coach loses key management or design personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business its operating results could suffer 

  coach’s performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams these executives and employees have substantial experience and expertise in coach’s business and 

13 have made significant contributions to its growth and success coach is a party to employment agreements with certain executives which provide for compensation and other benefits the agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on coach’s business as the business grows coach will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and develop train and manage an increasing number of management level sales and other employees coach cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future 

coach’s operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 

  because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue and that we will continue to balance our year round business 

coach’s trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its products if coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights others may sell imitation brand products 

  coach believes that its registered and common law trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to create and sustain demand for coach products coach cannot assure that it will not encounter trademark patent or trade dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and the geographic scope of its marketing coach also cannot assure that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its trademarks and proprietary rights by others the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and it may be more difficult for coach to successfully challenge the use of its proprietary rights by other parties in these countries 

provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party 

  coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 

  on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or 

14 more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2005 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan 

  coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board of directors coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board of directors coach’s board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements 

  these and other provisions of maryland law or coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders

15 pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on coach’s business or consolidated financial statements

  coach’s cost of sales consists of the costs associated with the sourcing of its products coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from quarter to quarter gross profit increased to 13108 million in fiscal 2005 from 9901 million in fiscal 2004 and 6774 million in fiscal 2003 gross margin increased to 766 in fiscal 2005 as compared to 749 in fiscal 2004 and 711 in fiscal 2003 representing an increase of 170 basis points in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and 380 basis points in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 these increases were primarily driven by the factors discussed above 

  selling general and administrative expenses comprise four categories selling advertising marketing and design distribution and customer service and administration and information services selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coach and coach japan operated stores open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and customer services expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administration and information services expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as consulting and software expenses selling general and administrative expenses increase as coach and coach japan operate more stores although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of selling general and administrative expenses being spread over a larger sales base 

21   operating income was 6218 million 4445 million and 2438 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the 399 increase in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 and 823 increase in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 were both driven by the increases in net sales and gross profit discussed previously partially offset by increases in selling general and administrative expenses 

  net income was 3887 million 2617 million and 1466 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in all fiscal years the increases in net income were primarily attributable to the increases in operating income discussed above

  direct net sales increased 288 to 9355 million during fiscal 2005 from 7265 million during fiscal 2004 driven by increased comparable store sales new store sales and expanded store sales in our north american retail and factory stores divisions sales growth in comparable stores was 141 for retail stores and 239 for factory stores comparable store sales growth for the entire north american store chain was 182 which accounted for 1120 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2004 coach has opened 19 retail stores and seven factory stores sales from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from stores opened during fiscal 2004 accounted for 848 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2004 coach also expanded seven retail stores and two factory stores sales from these expanded stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from stores expanded during fiscal 2004 accounted for 110 million of the net sales increase sales growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase the net sales increase was offset by an additional week of sales during fiscal 2004 which represented approximately 116 million also these increases were slightly offset by a decline in the direct marketing channel and store closures since the end of fiscal 2004 coach has closed one factory store 

  indirect net sales increased 303 to 7749 million in fiscal 2005 from 5946 million during fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily driven by growth at coach japan inc in which net sales increased 957 million over the comparable period of the prior year since the end of fiscal 2004 we have opened 12 locations in japan sales from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from other new stores accounted for 403 million of the net sales increase in addition comparable store net sales gains accounted for an increase of 303 million over the prior year since the end of fiscal 2004 we have also expanded 14 locations in japan sales from these expanded stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from other expanded stores accounted for 202 million of the net sales increase finally the impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in reported net sales of 129 million the net sales increase was slightly offset by 41 million of sales from coach japan during the additional week of fiscal 2004 the net sales increase was further offset by coach japan store closures since the end of fiscal 2004 coach japan has closed eight locations 

  the increase in indirect net sales was also driven by growth in the us wholesale international wholesale and businesstobusiness divisions which contributed increased sales of 478 million 190 million and 99 million respectively as compared to the prior year the remaining net sales increase is attributable to increases in other indirect channels the net sales increase was slightly offset by 38 million of sales from other indirect channels during the additional week of fiscal 2004 

   gross profit increased 324 to 13108 million in fiscal 2005 from 9901 million in fiscal 2004 gross margin increased 170 basis points to 766 in fiscal 2005 from 749 in fiscal 2004 this improvement was driven by a shift in channel mix as our higher gross margin channels grew faster than the business as a whole which contributed approximately 80 additional basis points a shift in product mix reflecting increased penetration of higher margin mixed material product and accessories which contributed approximately 60 additional basis points and the continuing impact of sourcing cost initiatives which contributed approximately 30 additional basis points

 24 

   selling general and administrative expenses increased 263 to 6890 million in fiscal 2005 from 5456 million in fiscal 2004 the dollar increase was caused primarily by increased store operating expenses attributable to new stores opened both domestically and in japan and increased variable expenses to support increased net sales as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2005 were 403 compared to 413 during fiscal 2004 this improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales 

  selling expenses increased 288 to 4973 million or 291 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 3862 million or 292 of net sales in fiscal 2004 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses associated with coach japan and operating expenses associated with north american stores that were opened during and after the end of fiscal 2004 the increase in coach japan expenses was 514 million driven by new store operating expenses investment in corporate infrastructure increased variable expenses related to higher sales and increased advertising expense to support the brand in japan in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased reported expenses by 58 million domestically coach has opened 19 new retail stores and seven new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2004 expenses from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of expenses from stores opened in fiscal 2004 increased total expenses by 231 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth 

  advertising marketing and design costs increased by 241 to 788 million or 46 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 635 million or 48 of net sales in fiscal 2004 this dollar increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures 

  distribution and customer service expenses increased to 369 million in fiscal 2005 from 324 million in fiscal 2004 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility resulted in an improvement in the ratio of these expenses to net sales from 25 in fiscal 2004 to 22 in fiscal 2005 

  administrative expenses increased 197 to 760 million or 44 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 635 million or 48 of net sales in fiscal 2004 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased compensation costs as well as increased professional and consulting fees included in administrative expenses are business interruption proceeds of 26 million related to our world trade center location 

   net interest income was 158 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 32 million in fiscal 2004 this dollar change was due to increased positive cash balances during fiscal 2005 as well as higher returns on investments during fiscal 2004 coach began investing in marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days which yielded greater rates of return 

   the effective tax rate decreased to 369 in fiscal 2005 compared with the 375 recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the buyout of our joint venture partner in coach japan and a continued need to grow the coach japan business we have determined that the earnings of coach japan will be permanently reinvested and the tax provision previously recorded relating to the expatriation of those earnings was reversed the reversal was recorded in the fourth quarter and brought the full year to the lower effective appropriate annual rate 

   minority interest expense net of tax decreased to 136 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 180 million or 14 of net sales in fiscal 2004 the decrease was primarily due to transfer price increases to coach japan inc increased marketing expenses and additional infrastructure investments

financial condition 

   net cash provided from operating activities was 5443 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 4545 million in fiscal 2004 the 898 million increase was due primarily to increased earnings of 1269 million as well as an increase in accrued liabilities of 361 million primarily attributable to a higher provision for income taxes there was a decrease in the change in accounts receivable of 106 million due to improved collection rates the increase was offset by increased deferred taxes of 679 million finally there was a decrease in the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 280 million 

  net cash used in investment activities was 3718 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 3753 million in fiscal 2004 the decrease in net cash used in investment activities is attributable to investment maturities during the year of 3307 million this decrease was partially offset by the buyout of our joint venture partner’s 

27 interest in coach japan of 2284 million increased investment purchases of 778 million and increased capital expenditures of 209 million which related primarily to new and renovated retail stores in the united states and japan as well as technology enhancements 

  net cash used in financing activities was 2806 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 457 million in fiscal 2004 the 2349 million increase in cash used resulted from an additional 2100 million of funds expended to repurchase common stock in connection with the buyout of coach japan we distributed accumulated earnings of 574 million and repaid our initial investment of 155 million to our joint venture partner the increase in cash used was offset by additional net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of 354 million and increased proceeds of 127 million received from the exercise of stock options 

  on october 16 2003 coach certain lenders and bank of america na “bank of america” as primary lender and administrative agent renewed the 100 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “bank of america facility” extending the facility expiration to october 16 2006 at coach’s request the bank of america facility can be expanded to 125 million on june 23 2005 this facility was expanded for one additional year to october 16 2007 this facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium 

  during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 there were no borrowings under the bank of america facility as of july 2 2005 there were no outstanding borrowings under the bank of america facility 

  under this revolving credit facility coach pays a commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points based on the company’s fixed charge coverage ratio on any unused amounts of the revolving credit facility the initial commitment fee was 15 basis points at july 2 2005 the commitment fee was 125 basis points the initial libor margin under the facility was 625 basis points at july 2 2005 the libor margin was 55 basis points reflecting an improvement in our fixedcharge coverage ratio 

  the bank of america facility contains various covenants and customary events of default coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception 

  to provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes coach japan entered into credit facilities with several japanese financial institutions these facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 86 billion yen or approximately 77 million at july 2 2005 interest is based on the tokyo interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points 

  during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 the peak borrowings under the japanese credit facilities were 505 million and 361 million respectively at july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 outstanding borrowings under the japanese facilities were 123 million and 17 million respectively 

  these japanese facilities contain various covenants and customary events of default coach japan has been in compliance with all covenants since their inception these facilities include automatic renewals based on compliance with the covenants coach inc is not a guarantor on these facilities 

  on august 12 2004 the coach board of directors approved a 200 million increase to the company’s existing common stock repurchase program and extended the duration of this program through august 2006 as of april 2 2005 coach had completed this authorization of the stock repurchase program 

  on may 11 2005 the coach board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program to acquire up to 250 million of coach’s outstanding common stock purchases of coach stock may be made from time to time subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 

  during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 coach repurchased 110 million and 30 million shares respectively of common stock at an average cost of 2409 and 1818 per share respectively 

  in fiscal 2005 total capital expenditures were 946 million coach opened 19 new retail and seven new factory stores in north america which represented 200 million of capital expenditures we also expanded 

28 seven retail stores and two factory stores which represented 199 million of capital expenditures spending on department store renovations and distributor locations was 47 million in addition 140 million was used for information systems and corporate facilities these investments were financed from internally generated cash flows and on hand cash in japan we invested 229 million primarily for the opening of 12 new locations store expansions and information systems these investments were financed by using funds from our japanese revolving credit facilities and operating cash flow 

  coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2005 coach purchased approximately 377 million of inventory which was funded by on hand cash operating cash flow and by borrowings under the japanese revolving credit facilities 

  management believes that cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control 

  currently sara lee is a guarantor or a party to many of coach’s leases coach has agreed to make efforts to remove sara lee from all of its existing leases and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee but for which sara lee retains contingent liability coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than 20 million the initial letter of credit had a face amount of 206 million and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced as of july 2 2005 the letter of credit was 154 million we expect that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years 

  as of july 2 2005 the scheduled maturities of coach’s longterm contractual obligations are as follows 

   coach does not have any offbalancesheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes the valuation of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent thirdparty sources 

   coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville florida facility this loan has a remaining balance of 34 million and bears interest at 877 principal and interest payments are made semiannually with the final payment due in 2014 

   because its products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue and we will further balance our year round business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements 

  in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories 

   the company leases retail stores and office space under operating leases the majority of the company’s lease agreements provide for tenant improvement allowances rent escalation clauses andor contingent rent provisions in fiscal 2005 the company conformed its accounting for operating leases and leasehold improvements to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 13 and its related interpretations as clarified by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission to the american institute of certified public accountants on february 7 2005 

  tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit on the balance sheet and amortized over the lease term which is consistent with the amortization period for the constructed assets historically the consolidated balance sheets reflected these allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures and the carrying value of fixed assets and the consolidated statements of cash flows reflected tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within investing activities since the impact of this change in accounting was not material to any previously reported fiscal year the cumulative effect was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 

  in addition to the above the company recorded a cumulative noncash charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 to reflect the impact of recording rent expense prior to the store opening during the construction buildout period previously the company recognized the straightline rent expense for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date which generally had the effect of excluding the buildout period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expensed rent the company now records rent expense when it takes possession of a store to begin its buildout which generally occurs before the stated commencement of the lease term and is approximately 60 to 90 days prior to the opening of the store the adjustment resulted in a cumulative noncash charge to rent expense of approximately 48 million during fiscal 2005 of which approximately 43 million related to prior periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates 

   foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues translated into us dollars 

  approximately 98 of coach’s fiscal 2005 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china hong kong italy india singapore south korea spain turkey costa rica hungary indonesia thailand taiwan and philippines additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not hedged by coach using any derivative instruments 

  coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollar denominated inventory purchases the company through coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these risks these transactions are in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the eurodenominated expenses of its italian sourcing office during fiscal 2003 coach began a program to enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily foreign exchange forward contracts in order to manage these fluctuations however during fiscal 2004 we reassessed this program and determined based on current business conditions that we would discontinue hedging against the euro 

  the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in accrued liabilities at july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 were 0 and 05 million respectively the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 was 15 million and 0 respectively as of july 2 2005 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 469 million were fair valued resulting in an increase to equity as a benefit to other comprehensive income of 12 million net of taxes as of july 3 2004 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 636 million were fair valued resulting in a reduction to equity as a charge to other comprehensive income of 05 million net of taxes 

   coach faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of 157 million at july 2 2005 of this amount 123 million under revolving credit facilities is subject to interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 1 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coach’s approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coach’s licensing partners pay us royalties on their net sales of coach branded products however such royalties are not material to the coach business as they currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s total revenues the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved manufacturing   coach has refined its production capabilities in coordination with the repositioning of its brand by shifting its production from owned domestic facilities to independent manufacturers in lowercost markets it can support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new more fashionoriented styles during fiscal year 2004 approximately 61 of coach’s total net sales excluding coach japan were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year at the same time we help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory by designating a significant number of the new styles as “limited editions” that are planned to be offered for a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products 9   coach has developed a flexible model that meets shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences it uses two main sources to make coach products outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its licensing partners all product sources must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as it has moved its production to external sources coach still requires that these same raw materials are used in all of its products wherever they are made we monitor compliance with the quality control standards through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities   all of coach’s fiscal year 2004 product requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers coach buys independently manufactured products from many countries including china turkey india costa rica dominican republic hungary indonesia italy korea philippines singapore spain taiwan and thailand coach operates sourcing offices in hong kong china and south korea that work closely with our sourced vendors coach also operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of

vendor provides more than 15 of coach’s total requirements before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards distribution

distribution center employees use handheld optical scanners to read product bar codes which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped via federal express and common carrier to coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via federal express direct to consumers management information systems   the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning system this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth   complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is wellsuited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports corporate sales and inventory functions creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling production procurement with financial plans product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s internet and catalog businesses are supported by coach’s order management system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system 10 trademarks and patents   coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold its major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design and coach and tag design and it has applications pending for a proprietary “c” signature fabric design coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world   coach’s trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date coach has no material patents employees   as of july 3 2004 coach employed approximately 4200 people about 50 of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements of the total 2400 are engaged in retail selling and administration positions 400 are engaged in sourcing or distribution functions and 700 are employed through coach japan the remaining employees are engaged in other aspects of the coach business coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or significant work stoppage government regulation   most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations risk factors   you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” on page 3 if coach is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business its future operating results will suffer   successful implementation of coach’s strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth to manage growth effectively coach will need to continue to increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict quality control coach will also need to continue to improve its operating systems to respond to any increased demand it could suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its products do not continue to meet its quality control standards or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in consumer demand for its products coach’s inability to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner could adversely affect its sales   coach’s success depends on its ability to identify originate and define product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner its products must appeal 11 to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change coach cannot assure that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future 

if coach misjudges the demand for its products it may incur increased costs due to excess inventories   if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated competition in the markets in which coach operates is intense and our competitors may develop products that are more popular with consumers   coach faces intense competition in the product lines and markets in which it operates coach’s products compete with other brands of products within their product category and with private label products sold by retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers in its wholesale business coach competes with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of handbags accessories and other products for the limited space available for the display of these products to the consumer moreover the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which coach operates which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its competitive position and business finally some of coach’s competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items which could adversely affect coach’s sales   many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales coach’s business is subject to foreign exchange risk   coach sells products to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however those distributors sell coach product in the relevant local currency currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international demand   the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollardenominated inventory purchases in order to manage this risk coach japan enters into forward exchange contracts that allow them to obtain dollars at a rate that is set concurrent with the requisition of inventory these contracts meet the definition of a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as these contracts are entered into before the receipt of inventory the contract rate may be higher or lower than market rates when the goods are received and the payment is completed all contracts are fair valued at the end of the reporting period if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge effective subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged items affect earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately this noncash charge or credit can result in fluctuations in the reported financial results   coach consolidates the financial results of coach japan into its financial statements the functional currency of coach japan is the japanese yen these operating results are converted to us dollars based on the average exchange rate during the period and the balance sheet is converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period 12 if coach loses key management or design personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business its operating results could suffer   coach’s performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams these executives and employees have substantial experience and expertise in coach’s business and have made significant contributions to its growth and success coach is a party to employment agreements with certain executives which provide for compensation and other benefits the agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on coach’s business as the business grows coach will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and develop train and manage an increasing number of managementlevel sales and other employees coach cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future coach’s operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock   because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue and that we will continue to balance our year round business coach’s gross profit may decrease if it becomes unable to obtain its products from or sell its products in other countries due to adverse international events that are beyond its control   in order to lower its sourcing costs and increase its gross profit coach has shifted its production to independent nonus manufacturers in lowercost markets coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues these factors among others could influence the ability of these independent manufacturers to make or export coach products costeffectively or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these products the violation of labor or other laws by any of coach’s independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical by coach or others in the us could damage coach’s reputation and force it to locate alternative manufacturing sources currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of raw materials for these independent manufacturers which they could pass along to coach resulting in higher costs and decreased margins for its products if any of these factors were to render a particular country undesirable or impractical as a source of supply there could be an adverse effect on coach’s business including its gross profit   coach’s failure to continue to increase sales of its products in international markets could adversely affect its gross profit international sales are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations foreign consumer preferences political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments to other nations tourism and changes in local economic conditions these factors among others could influence coach’s ability to sell products successfully in international markets coach generally purchases products from international manufacturers in us dollars and sells these products in the us and to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however coach’s international wholesale customers sell coach products in the relevant local currencies and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international consumer demand 13 coach’s trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its products if coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights others may sell imitation brand products   coach believes that its registered and common law trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to create and sustain demand for coach products coach cannot assure you that it will not encounter trademark patent or trade dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and the geographic scope of its marketing coach also cannot assure that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its trademarks and proprietary rights by others the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and it may be more difficult for coach to successfully challenge the use of its proprietary rights by other parties in these countries provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party   coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders   on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock as of the end of fiscal 2004 there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10 threshold established by the rights plan   coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board of directors coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board of directors coach’s board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements   these and other provisions of maryland law or coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders 14

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect coach’s intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within coach’s control and litigation with present or former employees as part of its policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time coach files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent infringement trade dress infringement trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time coach may have one or more of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of usbased employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts coach believes however that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on coach’s business or consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document executive overview   founded in 1941 coach is a designer and marketer of highquality modern american classic accessories coach’s primary product offerings include handbags women’s and men’s accessories business cases weekend and travel accessories outerwear and related accessories

sale of coach branded watches footwear eyewear and office furniture net sales were 13211 million 9532 million and 7194 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively representing a 386 increase in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 and a 325 increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 these net sales increases were driven by growth across all distribution channels   coach’s cost of sales consists of the costs associated with the sourcing of its products coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels changes in the mix of products sold and fluctuations in material costs these factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from quarter to quarter gross profit increased to 9901 million in fiscal 2004 from 6774 million in fiscal 2003 and 4834 million in fiscal 2002 gross margin increased to 749 in fiscal 2004 as compared to 711 in fiscal 2003 and 672 in fiscal 2002 representing an increase of 380 basis points in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 and 390 basis points in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 these increases were primarily driven by the factors discussed above   selling general and administrative expenses comprise four categories selling advertising marketing and design distribution and customer service and administration and information services selling expenses include store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses these expenses are affected by the number of coach and coach japan operated stores open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and customer services expenses include warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administration and information services expenses include compensation costs for the executive finance human resources legal and information systems departments as well as consulting and software expenses selling general and administrative expenses increase as coach and coach japan operate more stores although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of selling general and administrative expenses being spread over a larger sales base 20   as part of coach’s transformation from a manufacturer to a marketer in april 2002 coach ceased production at its lares puerto rico manufacturing facility this reorganization intended to reduce costs by transferring production to lower cost thirdparty manufacturers involved the termination of 394 manufacturing warehousing and management employees at the lares facility   operating income was 4445 million 2438 million and 1336 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 823 increase in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 and 824 increase in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 were both driven by the increases in net sales and gross profit discussed previously partially offset by increases in selling general and administrative expenses   net income was 2617 million 1466 million and 858 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in all fiscal years the increases in net income were primarily attributable to the increases in operating income discussed above partially offset by higher provisions for income taxes and higher minority interest charges   coach’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to june 30 fiscal 2004 was 53weeks whereas fiscal 2003 and 2002 were each 52week periods the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately 195 million of additional net sales   the following is a discussion of the results of operations for fiscal 2004 compared to

   coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation similarly stores that are expanded by more than 15 are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base in fiscal 2004 53 weeks of sales were reported and compared to the equivalent 53week period   direct net sales increased 298 to 7265 million during fiscal 2004 from 5595 million in fiscal 2003 driven by increased comparable store sales new store sales and expanded store sales in our north american retail and factory stores divisions this net sales increase was also driven by an additional week of sales which represented approximately 116 million of the total sales growth in comparable stores was 219 for retail stores and 103 for factory stores comparable store sales growth for the entire north american store chain was 169 which accounted for 957 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2003 coach has opened 19 retail stores and two factory stores sales from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from stores opened during fiscal 2003 accounted for 530 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2003 coach also expanded nine retail stores sales from these expanded stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from stores expanded during fiscal 2003 accounted for 153 million of the net sales increase sales growth in the internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase these increases were slightly offset by a decline in the direct marketing channel and store closures since the end of fiscal 2003 coach has closed one retail store and two factory stores   indirect net sales increased 510 to 5946 million in fiscal 2004 from 3937 million during fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily driven by growth at our japanese joint venture coach japan inc in which net sales increased 1004 million over the comparable period of the prior year including 41 million of sales during the additional week of the fiscal year since the end of fiscal 2003 we have opened eight locations in japan sales from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of sales from stores opened during fiscal 2003 accounted for 440 million of the net sales increase our japan locations experienced doubledigit comparable net sales gains from the prior year which represented 333 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2003 we have also expanded 16 locations in japan which accounted for 73 million of the net sales increase finally the impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in reported net sales of 217 million these net sales increases were slightly offset by store closures since the end of fiscal 2003 coach japan has closed one location the increase in indirect net sales was also driven by growth in the us wholesale international wholesale and businesstobusiness divisions which contributed increased sales of 375 million 335 million and 220 million respectively as compared to the same period in the prior year the remaining net sales increase is attributable to increases in other indirect channels   gross profit   gross profit increased 462 to 9901 million in fiscal 2004 from 6774 million in fiscal 2003 gross margin increased 380 basis points to 749 in fiscal 2004 from 711 in fiscal 2003 this improvement was driven by a shift in channel mix as our higher gross margin channels grew faster than the business as a whole 22 which contributed approximately 140 additional basis points a shift in product mix reflecting increased penetration of higher margin mixed material product and accessories which contributed approximately 120 additional basis points and the continuing impact of sourcing cost initiatives which contributed approximately 120 additional basis points 

  the following chart illustrates the gross margin performance we have experienced over the last 12 quarters    selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased 258 to 5456 million in fiscal 2004 from 4337 million in fiscal 2003 the dollar increase was caused primarily by increased variable expenses related to coach japan increased variable expenses to support increased net sales and increased store operating expenses attributable to new stores opened both domestically and in japan as compared to the prior year as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2004 were 413 compared to 455 during fiscal 2003 this improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales   selling expenses increased 310 to 3862 million or 292 of net sales in fiscal 2004 from 2949 million or 309 of net sales in fiscal 2003 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses associated with coach japan and operating expenses associated with north american stores that were opened during and after the end of fiscal 2003 the increase in coach japan expenses was 428 million driven by new stores operating expenses increased variable expenses related to higher sales and the nonrecurrence of a 34 million favorable fair value adjustment for open foreign currency forward contracts in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased reported expenses by 100 million domestically coach has opened 19 new retail stores and two new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2003 expenses from these new stores as well as the noncomparable portion of expenses from stores opened in fiscal 2003 increased total expenses by 162 million the remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth   advertising marketing and design costs increased by 108 to 635 million or 48 of net sales in fiscal 2004 from 573 million or 60 of net sales in fiscal 2003 this dollar increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures   distribution and customer service expenses increased to 324 million in fiscal 2004 from 297 million in fiscal 2003 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility resulted in an improvement in the ratio of these expenses to net sales from 31 in fiscal 2003 to 25 in fiscal 2004   administrative expenses increased 226 to 635 million or 48 of net sales in fiscal 2004 from 518 million or 55 of net sales in fiscal 2003 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased compensation costs as well as increased professional and consulting fees these increases were offset by an increase in business interruption proceeds of 12 million related to our world trade center location   interest income net   net interest income was 32 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 11 million in fiscal 2003 this dollar change was due to increased positive cash balances during fiscal 2004 as well as higher returns on investments during fiscal 2004 coach began investing in marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days which yielded greater rates of return 23   provision for income taxes   the effective tax rate increased to 375 in fiscal 2004 compared with the 370 recorded in fiscal 2003   minority interest   minority interest expense net of tax increased to 180 million or 14 of net sales in fiscal 2004 from 76 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2003 this increase was due to increased profits from the operations of coach japan and the impact of a stronger yen   fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

 

   direct net sales increased 251 to 5595 million during fiscal 2003 from 4471 million in fiscal 2002 comparable store sales growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full year was 246 and 50 respectively comparable store growth for the entire domestic store chain was 152 which represented approximately 62 million of the net sales increase since the end of fiscal 2002 coach opened 20 retail stores and three factory stores expanded four retail and five factory stores and had wrap from fiscal 2002 openings which accounted for approximately 45 million of the increase in net sales the internet and direct marketing businesses accounted for the remaining sales increase the increase in net sales was partially offset by the two retail stores and one factory store that were closed since the end of fiscal 2002   indirect net sales increased 446 to 3937 million in fiscal 2003 from 2723 million during fiscal 2002 the increase was primarily driven by coach japan in which net sales increased 894 million over the prior year we opened 14 locations in japan since the end of fiscal 2002 which represented approximately 42 million of the increase our japan locations experienced doubledigit net sales gains in comparable locations over the prior year which represented approximately 30 million of the increase in addition fiscal 2002 only included 11 months of coach japan operations while fiscal 2003 included a full year in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 coach japan acquired the distribution rights and assets of j osawa the effect of the incremental month of operations and acquisition of j osawa locations represented approximately 19 million of the increase in net sales these increases were partially offset by the closure of four locations since the end of fiscal 2002 this decrease was approximately 2 million the us wholesale and businesstobusiness divisions contributed increased sales of 213 million and 83 million respectively the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased net sales in the international wholesale division of 13 million the remaining change in net sales was due to increases in other indirect channels   gross profit   gross profit increased 401 to 6774 million in fiscal 2003 from 4834 million in fiscal 2002 gross margin increased 390 basis points to 711 in fiscal 2003 from 672 in fiscal 2002 this improvement was primarily driven by a shift in product mix reflecting the continued diversification into new and successful fabric and leather collections which contributed approximately 140 basis points there were sourcing cost initiatives which contributed approximately 120 basis points in addition there was a shift in channel mix which contributed approximately 100 basis points the remaining improvement was driven primarily by the consolidation of coach japan   selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased 252 to 4337 million in fiscal 2003 from 3464 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase was caused primarily by increased operating expenses in coach japan and the us stores these increased expenses were due to new stores and variable expenses to support increased net sales fiscal 2002 selling general and administrative expenses included 11 months of coach japan while fiscal 2003 included a full year as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2003 were 455 compared to 481 during fiscal 2002 this improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales 24   selling expenses increased by 286 to 2949 million in fiscal 2003 from 2293 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to the operating costs associated with coach japan and operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores fiscal 2002 expenses included 11 months of coach japan while fiscal 2003 included a full year the increase in coach japan expenses was 346 million included in the current year costs was a 34 million favorable fair value adjustment for foreign currency forward contracts compared to a 33 million unfavorable fair value adjustment in fiscal 2002 domestically coach opened 20 new retail stores and three new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2002 the increase in the us stores expense was 281 million the remaining increase to selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support comparable store growth as a percentage of net sales selling expenses improved from 319 in fiscal 2002 to 309 in fiscal 2003 the decline was due to leveraging higher sales in the domestic stores division   advertising marketing and design costs increased by 108 to 573 million or 60 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 517 million or 72 of net sales in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures   distribution and customer service expenses increased to 297 million in fiscal 2003 from 269 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility resulted in a decline in the ratio to net sales from 37 in fiscal 2002 to 31 in fiscal 2003   administrative expenses increased by 345 to 518 million or 55 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 385 million or 54 of net sales in fiscal 2002 the absolute dollar increase in these expenses was due in part to increased total compensation cost of approximately 8 million the increase was due primarily to increased base salary and employment agreements with certain executives which accounted for 9 million of the increase the increase was partially offset by decreased temporary employee costs there were higher occupancy costs of approximately 2 million associated with the full year impact of acquiring additional space in our new york city headquarters insurance settlement proceeds decreased approximately 2 million due to the nonrecurrence of store inventory and fixed asset recoveries relating to our world trade center location   reorganization costs   in march 2002 coach ceased production at its lares puerto rico manufacturing facility this reorganization involved the termination of 394 manufacturing warehousing and management employees and the disposition of the fixed assets at the lares facility these actions were intended to reduce costs by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost thirdparty manufacturers coach recorded a reorganization cost of 34 million the reorganization cost included 22 million for worker separation costs 07 million for lease termination costs and 05 million for the writedown of longlived assets to net realizable value   interest income net   net interest income was 11 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to an expense of 03 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar change was due to reduced borrowings and positive cash balances during fiscal 2003   provision for income taxes   the effective tax rate increased to 370 in fiscal 2003 compared with the 355 recorded in fiscal 2002 this increase was due in part to the closure of our facility in lares puerto rico and the elimination of related tax benefits   minority interest   minority interest net of tax increased to 76 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 02 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar change was due to increased profitability in coach japan coupled with a stronger yen 25 financial condition 

 

   net cash provided from operating activities was 4486 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 2216 million in fiscal 2003 this 2270 million increase was primarily the result of increased earnings of 1151 million and increased tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 650 million   net cash used in investment activities was 3694 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 571 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net cash used in investment activities is primarily attributable to the 3017 million purchase of investments during fiscal 2004 coach began investing in marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days in order to maximize the rate of return on our investments in addition capital expenditures also increased by 106 million which related primarily to new and renovated retail stores in the united states and japan as well as technology enhancements coach’s future capital expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of our businesses new store openings store renovations and international expansion opportunities   net cash used in financing activities was 457 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 293 million in fiscal 2003 the 164 million increase in cash used resulted from an additional 171 million of repayments related to coach japan’s credit facilities and an additional 50 million of funds expended to repurchase common stock offset by an additional 57 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options   on october 16 2003 coach certain lenders and fleet national bank “fleet” as primary lender and administrative agent renewed the 100 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “fleet facility” extending the facility expiration to october 16 2006 at coach’s request the fleet facility can be expanded to 125 million and during the first two years of its term the expiration can be extended for one additional year to october 16 2007 indebtedness under this revolving credit facility bears interest calculated at coach’s option at either a rate of libor plus a margin or the prime rate announced by fleet this facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes the facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium   during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 there were no borrowings under the fleet facility as of july 3 2004 there were no outstanding borrowings under the fleet facility   under this revolving credit facility coach pays a commitment fee of 125 to 30 basis points based on the company’s fixed charge coverage ratio on any unused amounts of the revolving credit facility the initial commitment fee was 30 basis points at july 3 2004 the commitment fee was 15 basis points the initial libor margin under the facility was 125 basis points at july 3 2004 the libor margin was 625 basis points reflecting an improvement in our fixedcharge coverage ratio   the fleet facility contains various covenants and customary events of default coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception   to provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes coach japan entered into credit facilities with several japanese financial institutions these facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 86 billion yen or approximately 79 million at july 3 2004 interest is based on the tokyo interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points   during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 the peak borrowings under the japanese credit facilities were 361 million and 434 million respectively at july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 outstanding borrowings under the japanese facilities were 17 million and 265 million respectively   these japanese facilities contain various covenants and customary events of default coach japan has been in compliance with all covenants since their inception these facilities include automatic renewals based on compliance with the covenants coach inc is not a guarantor on these facilities   the coach board of directors has authorized the establishment of a common stock repurchase program under this program up to 180 million may be utilized to repurchase coach’s outstanding common stock purchases of coach stock may be made from time to time subject to market conditions and at prevailing 26 market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares will be retired and may be reissued in the future for general corporate or other uses this stock repurchase program expires in january 2006 the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 

  during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 coach repurchased 15 million and 39 million shares respectively of common stock at an average cost of 3636 and 1295 per share respectively as of july 3 2004 coach had approximately 65 million remaining in the stock repurchase program   on august 12 2004 the coach board of directors approved a 200 million increase to the company’s existing common stock repurchase program and extended the duration of this program through august 2006   during august 2004 the company repurchased 24 million shares of common stock at an average cost of 3906 per share these stock repurchases of approximately 95 million were financed from cash on hand as of september 4 2004 coach had expended approximately 210 million of the 380 million authorized to date under the stock repurchase program   in fiscal 2004 total capital expenditures were 677 million coach opened 19 new retail and two new factory stores in north america which represented 195 million of capital expenditures as well as expanded nine stores which represented 118 million of capital expenditures spending on department store renovations and distributor locations was 39 million in addition 165 million was used for information systems and corporate facilities these investments were financed from internally generated cash flows and on hand cash in japan we invested 160 million primarily for the opening of eight new locations store expansions and information systems these investments were financed by using funds from our japanese revolving credit facilities and operating cash flow   coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2004 coach purchased approximately 349 million of inventory which was funded by on hand cash operating cash flow and by borrowings under the japanese revolving credit facilities   management believes that cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control   currently sara lee is a guarantor or a party to many of coach’s leases coach has agreed to make efforts to remove sara lee from all of its existing leases and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee but for which sara lee retains contingent liability coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than 20 million the initial letter of credit had a face amount of 206 million and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced as of july 3 2004 the letter of credit was 168 million we expect that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years 27   as of july 3 2004 the scheduled maturities of coach’s longterm contractual obligations are as follows    coach does not have any offbalancesheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes the valuation of financial instruments that are markedtomarket are based upon independent thirdparty sources longterm debt   coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville florida facility this loan has a remaining balance of 35 million and bears interest at 877 principal and interest payments are made semiannually with the final payment due in 2014 seasonality   because its products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales however over the past several years we have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday quarters which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations we expect that these trends will continue and we will further balance our year round business critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements   in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories stockbased compensation   two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available the intrinsic value method and the fair value method the company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options and accordingly no compensation expense has been recognized under either method the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for expanded disclosures inventories   us inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined by the firstin firstout method or market inventories in japan are valued at the lower of cost determined by the lastin firstout method or market 28 inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties reserves for slow moving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand we evaluate the adequacy of reserves quarterly a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slow moving and aged merchandise 

  for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements other critical accounting policies are as follows valuation of longlived assets   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which the company adopted effective with the beginning of fiscal 2002 the company assesses the carrying value of its longlived assets for possible impairment based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003 see note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for longlived asset writedowns recorded in connection with the company’s fiscal 2002 reorganization plan revenue recognition   sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported net sales from the licensee new accounting standards   during fiscal 2004 the company adopted sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation as the company does not expense stock options the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on coach’s consolidated financial position or results of operations sfas no 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects of stockbased compensation see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for these expanded disclosures   in april 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” to amend and clarify financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 133 in addition it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of sfas no 149 did not have an impact on coach’s financial position or results of operations   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances the provisions of sfas no 150 are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning 29 after june 15 2003 the adoption of sfas no 150 did not have an impact on coach’s financial position or results of operations 

  in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits however it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans as previously required by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” and no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” in addition to the disclosure requirements contained in sfas no 132 the revised statement requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined postretirement plans see note 9 “retirement plans” for these additional disclosures   in march 2004 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached consensus on eitf 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 provides guidance on the new requirements for otherthantemporary impairment and its application to debt and marketable equity investments that are accounted for under sfas no 115 the new requirements on disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 the implementation of eitf 031 did not have an impact on coach’s financial position or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual results may differ from those estimates foreign exchange   foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated contracts denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency and from foreigndenominated revenues translated into us dollars   approximately 98 of coach’s fiscal 2004 nonlicensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states these countries include china turkey india costa rica dominican republic hungary indonesia italy korea philippines singapore spain taiwan and thailand additionally sales are made through international channels to third party distributors substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties excluding coach japan are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not hedged by coach using any derivative instruments   coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its us dollar denominated inventory purchases the company through coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these risks these transactions are in accordance with coach’s risk management policies coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the eurodenominated expenses of its italian sourcing office during fiscal 2003 coach began a program to enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts primarily foreign exchange forward contracts in order to manage these fluctuations however during fiscal 2004 we reassessed this program and determined based on current business conditions that we would discontinue hedging against the euro 30   the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in accrued liabilities at july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 were 05 million and 0 respectively the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 was 0 and 04 million respectively as of july 3 2004 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 636 million were fair valued resulting in a reduction to equity as a charge to other comprehensive income of 05 million net of taxes as of june 28 2003 open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of 393 million respectively were fair valued resulting in an increase to equity as a benefit to other comprehensive income of 02 million net of taxes also during fiscal 2003 open foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges with a notional amount of 332 million were fair valued and resulted in a pretax non cash benefit to earnings of 34 million included as a component of selling general and administrative expenses interest rate   coach faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of 52 million at july 3 2004 of this amount 17 million under revolving credit facilities is subject to interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 1 change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach

manufacturing   coach has refined its production capabilities in coordination with the repositioning of its brand by shifting its production from owned domestic facilities to independent manufacturers in lowercost markets it can support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new more fashionoriented styles during fiscal year 2003 approximately 47 of coach’s net sales excluding coach japan were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year at the same time we help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory by designating a large number of the new styles as “limited editions” that are planned to be discontinued and replaced with fresh new products   coach has developed a flexible model that meets shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences it uses two main sources to make coach products outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its licensing partners all product sources must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as it has moved its production to external sources coach still requires that these same raw materials are used in all of its products wherever they are made we monitor compliance with the quality control standards through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities   all of coach’s fiscal year 2003 product requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers coach buys independently manufactured products from a variety of countries including china costa rica mexico india italy spain hungary and turkey it operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new york design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery no one vendor provides more than 15 of coach’s total requirements before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards   as part of the strategy to shift production to independent manufacturers in lowercost markets coach ceased operations at its remaining facility located in lares puerto rico in april 2002 distribution   in july 1999 coach consolidated its worldwide warehousing distribution and repair functions into one location in jacksonville florida this highly automated computerized 560000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld optical scanners to read product bar codes which allows them to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers coach’s products are primarily shipped via federal express and common carriers to coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via federal express direct to consumers management information systems   the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning system implemented in 1997 this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies and greater inventory control this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth 11   complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other system solutions each of which coach believes is wellsuited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports corporate sales and inventory functions creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling production procurement with financial plans product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s catalog and internet businesses are supported by coach’s direct sales system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system trademarks and patents   coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold its major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design and coach and tag design and it has applications pending for a proprietary “c” signature fabric design  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world   coach’s trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date coach has no material patents employees   as of june 28 2003 coach employed approximately 3200 people approximately 50 of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements of the total approximately 1700 are engaged in retail selling and administration positions approximately 400 are engaged in manufacturing sourcing or distribution functions and approximately 600 are employed through coach japan the remaining employees are engaged in other aspects of the coach business coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or significant work stoppage government regulation   most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations risk factors   you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” on page 2 12 if coach is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business its future operating results will suffer   successful implementation of coach’s strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth to manage growth effectively coach will need to continue to increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict quality control coach will also need to continue to improve its operating systems to respond to any increased demand it could suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its products do not continue to meet its quality control standards or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in consumer demand for its products coach’s inability to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner could adversely affect its sales   coach’s success depends on its ability to identify originate and define product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner its products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change coach cannot assure that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future if coach misjudges the demand for its products it may incur increased costs due to excess inventories   if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated competition in the markets in which coach operates is intense and our competitors may develop products that are more popular with consumers   coach faces intense competition in the product lines and markets in which it operates coach’s products compete with other brands of products within their product category and with private label products sold by retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers in its wholesale business coach competes with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of handbags accessories and other products for the limited space available for the display of these products to the consumer moreover the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which coach operates which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its competitive position and business some of coach’s competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than the company a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items which could adversely affect coach’s sales   many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach’s sales coach’s business is subject to foreign exchange risk   coach sells products to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however those distributors sell coach product in the relevant local currency currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international demand   in order to manage this risk coach japan enters into forward exchange contracts that allow them to obtain dollars at a rate that is set concurrent with the requisition of inventory these contracts meet the 13 definition of a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as these contracts are entered into before the receipt of inventory the contract rate may be higher or lower than market rates when the goods are received and the payment is completed all contracts are fair valued at the end of the reporting period if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge effective subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged items affect earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately this noncash charge or credit can result in fluctuations in the reported financial results 

  coach consolidates the financial results of coach japan into its financial statements the functional currency of coach japan is the japanese yen these operating results are converted to us dollars based on the average exchange rate during the period and the balance sheet is converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period if coach loses key management or design personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business its operating results could suffer   coach’s performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams these executives and employees have substantial experience and expertise in coach’s business and have made significant contributions to its growth and success coach is a party to employment agreements with certain executives which provide for compensation and other benefits the agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on coach’s business as the business grows coach will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and develop train and manage an increasing number of managementlevel sales and other employees coach cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future coach’s operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock   because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in its sales and operating results over the past two fiscal years approximately 33 of coach’s annual sales and approximately 47 of its operating income were recognized in the second fiscal quarter which includes the holiday months of november and december coach’s gross profit may decrease if it becomes unable to obtain its products from or sell its products in other countries due to adverse international events that are beyond its control   in order to lower its sourcing costs and increase its gross profit coach has shifted its production to independent nonus manufacturers in lowercost markets coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues these factors among others could influence the ability of these independent manufacturers to make or export coach products costeffectively or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these products the violation of labor or other laws by any of coach’s independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical by coach or others in the us could damage coach’s reputation and force it to locate alternative manufacturing sources currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of raw materials for these independent manufacturers which they could pass along to coach resulting in higher costs and decreased margins for its products if any of these factors were to render a particular country undesirable or impractical as a source of supply there could be an adverse effect on coach’s business including its gross profit   coach’s failure to continue to increase sales of its products in international markets could adversely affect its gross profit international sales are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations foreign consumer preferences political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments to other nations tourism and 14 changes in local economic conditions these factors among others could influence coach’s ability to sell products successfully in international markets coach generally purchases products from international manufacturers in us dollars and sells these products in the us and to its international wholesale customers in us dollars however coach’s international wholesale customers sell coach products in the relevant local currencies and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international consumer demand 

coach’s trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its products if coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights others may sell imitation brand products   coach believes that its registered and common law trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to create and sustain demand for coach products coach cannot assure you that it will not encounter trademark patent or trade dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and the geographic scope of its marketing coach also cannot assure that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its trademarks and proprietary rights by others the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and it may be more difficult for coach to successfully challenge the use of its proprietary rights by other parties in these countries provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party   coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders   on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock we are currently aware of one institutional shareholder whose common stock holdings exceed the 10 threshold established by the rights plan this holder has been given permission to increase its ownership in the company to a maximum of 15 subject to certain exceptions before triggering the provision of the rights plan   coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board of directors coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period unless exempted in accordance with the statute 15 after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board of directors coach’s board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements 

  these and other provisions of maryland law or coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings   coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business including proceedings to protect coach’s intellectual property rights litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within coach’s control and litigation with present or former employees as part of its policing program for its intellectual property rights from time to time coach files lawsuits in the us and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting trademark infringement patent infringement trade dress infringement trademark dilution andor state or foreign law claims at any given point in time coach may have one or more of such actions pending these actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise andor out of court settlements with defendants from time to time defendants will raise as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of coach’s intellectual properties although coach’s litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of coach’s business as well as for any business employing significant numbers of usbased employees such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory andor punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age gender race religion disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts coach believes however that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on coach’s business cash flows results of operations or financial position

   selling general and administrative expenses increased 252 to 4337 million in fiscal 2003 from 3464 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase was caused primarily by increased operating expenses in coach japan and the us stores these increased expenses were due to new stores and variable expenses to support increased net sales fiscal 2002 selling general and administrative expenses included 11 months of coach japan while fiscal 2003 included a full year as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2003 were 455 compared to 481 during fiscal 2002 the decline was due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales   selling expenses increased by 286 to 2949 million in fiscal 2003 from 2293 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to the operating costs associated with coach japan and operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores fiscal 2002 expenses included 11 months of coach japan while fiscal 2003 included a full year the increase in coach japan expenses was 346 million included in the current year costs was a 34 million favorable fair value adjustment for foreign currency forward contracts compared to a 33 million unfavorable fair value adjustment in fiscal 2002 domestically coach opened 20 new retail stores and three new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2002 the increase in the us stores expense was 281 million the remaining increase to selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support comparable store growth as a percentage of net sales selling expenses improved from 319 in fiscal 2002 to 309 in fiscal 2003 the decline was due to leveraging higher sales in the domestic stores division   advertising marketing and design costs increased by 108 to 573 million or 60 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 517 million or 72 of net sales in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures   distribution and customer service expenses increased to 297 million in fiscal 2003 from 269 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes however efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility resulted in a decline in the ratio to net sales from 37 in fiscal 2002 to 31 in fiscal 2003   administrative expenses increased by 345 to 518 million or 55 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 385 million or 54 of net sales in fiscal 2002 the absolute dollar increase in these expenses was due to increased total compensation cost of approximately 8 million the increase was due primarily to increased base salary and employment agreements with certain executives which accounted for 9 million of the increase the increase was partially offset by decreased temporary employee costs there were higher occupancy costs of approximately 2 million associated with the full year impact of acquiring additional space in our new york city headquarters insurance settlement proceeds decreased approximately 2 million due to the nonrecurrence of store inventory and fixed asset recoveries relating to our world trade center location   reorganization costs   in march 2002 coach ceased production at its lares puerto rico manufacturing facility this reorganization involved the termination of 394 manufacturing warehousing and management employees and the disposition of the fixed assets at the lares facility these actions were intended to reduce costs by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost thirdparty manufacturers coach recorded a reorganization cost 24 of 34 million the reorganization costs included 22 million for worker separation costs 07 million for lease termination costs and 05 million for the writedown of longlived assets to net realizable value 

  operating income   operating income increased 824 to 2437 million in fiscal 2003 from 1336 million in fiscal 2002 this increase resulted from higher sales improved gross margins and the nonrecurrence of reorganization costs partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses   interest income net   net interest income was 11 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to an expense of 03 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar change was due to reduced borrowings and positive cash balances during fiscal 2003   income taxes   the effective tax rate increased to 370 in fiscal 2003 compared with the 355 recorded in fiscal 2002 this increase was due in part to the closure of our facility in lares puerto rico and the elimination of related tax benefits   minority interest   minority interest net of tax increased to 76 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 02 million in fiscal 2002 the dollar change was due to increased profitability in coach japan coupled with a stronger yen   net income   net income increased 708 to 1466 million in fiscal 2003 from 858 million in fiscal 2002 this increase was the result of increased operating income partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher minority interest   earnings per share   diluted net income per share was 158 in fiscal 2003 and 094 in fiscal 2002 which includes the effect of the twoforone stock split in july 2002   fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001   net sales   net sales increased by 198 to 7194 million in fiscal 2002 from 6005 million in fiscal 2001 these results reflect increased volume in both the directtoconsumer and indirect channels   direct net sales increased 141 to 4471 million in fiscal 2002 from 3918 million in fiscal 2001 the increase was primarily due to new store openings net sales from new retail and factory stores accounted for approximately 78 or 429 million of the increase in net sales since the end of fiscal 2001 coach opened 20 retail stores and six factory stores in addition comparable store sales growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full year was 43 and 34 which primarily represented the balance of the increase in net sales which was partially offset by the three retail stores that were closed during fiscal 2002   indirect net sales increased 305 to 2723 million in fiscal 2002 from 2087 million in fiscal 2001 this increase was driven primarily by the consolidation of coach japan and comparable store sales growth in japan coach japan sales to consumers are recorded at retail versus sales to the former distributors which were recorded at wholesale value the impact of coach japan accounted for approximately 55 million of the increase in net sales this increase is a result of the shift to retail from wholesale pricing which contributed approximately 37 million of the increase with the balance of this increase resulting from increased sales volume the international wholesale business was relatively consistent compared to the prior year the 25 us wholesale category accounted for approximately 8 million of the increase in net sales offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately 4 million in the businesstobusiness category 

  gross profit   gross profit increased 265 to 4834 million in fiscal 2002 from 3820 million in fiscal 2001 gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points to 672 in fiscal 2002 from 636 in fiscal 2001 this improvement was driven by the consolidation of coach japan which contributed approximately 230 basis points there was a shift in product mix reflecting the continued diversification into nonleather fabrications with new and successful mixedmaterial collections this contributed approximately 100 basis points in addition gross margin benefited from the continuing impact of sourcing cost reductions which contributed 30 basis points   selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased 256 to 3464 million in fiscal 2002 from 2757 million in fiscal 2001 selling general and administrative expenses increased to 481 as a percentage of net sales versus 459 in fiscal 2001   selling expenses increased by 409 to 2293 million or 319 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 1627 million or 271 of net sales in fiscal 2001 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to the operating costs associated with coach japan which were borne by former distributors in prior periods operating costs associated with coach japan totaled 466 million in fiscal 2002 included in these costs was a 33 million fair value adjustment for open foreign currency forward contracts also contributing to the increase was 201 million in operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores increased variable costs for comparable store

than the prior year and the increase in inventory was 92 million less than the prior year this increase was partially offset by increased capital spending of 143 million over the prior year   capital expenditures amounted to 571 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 428 million in fiscal 2002 and in both periods related primarily to new and renovated retail stores coach’s future capital expenditures

  coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2003 coach purchased approximately 283 million of inventory which was funded by on hand cash operating cash flow and by borrowings under its revolving credit facility   management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments and to comply with all of

a key communications vehicle for the brand which also promotes store traffic as an integral component of its communications strategy the graphics models and photography are upscale and modern and present the product in an environment consistent with the coach brand position the catalogs highlight selected products and serve as a reference for customers whether ordering through the catalog making instore purchases or purchasing over the internet indirect channels   coach began as a wholesaler to department stores this channel remains very important to its overall consumer reach coach has grown its indirect business by the formation of coach japan and working closely with its customers both domestic and international to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation as part of coach’s business transformation selected shopwithinshop locations in major department stores are being renovated to achieve the same modern look and feel as the coach retail stores at the end of fiscal 2002 130 international locations and 43 us department stores were renovated to reflect the new modern design the indirect channel represented approximately 38 of total net sales in fiscal 2002   coach japan inc in order to expand its presence in the japanese market and to exercise greater control over its brand in that country coach formed coach japan this entity is a joint venture with sumitomo corporation and manages the coach business in japan this channel represented approximately 12 of total net sales in fiscal 2002 on july 31 2001 coach japan purchased pdc coach’s largest

  international wholesale coach’s international business which represented approximately 8 of total sales in fiscal 2002 is generated through wholesale distributors and authorized retailers coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who market coach products through specialty retailers department stores travel shopping locations and freestanding coach stores in 18 countries coach’s current network of international distributors serves markets such as australia the united kingdom the caribbean korea hong kong and singapore coach has created image enhancing environments in these locations to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth within the international arena the primary focus is the japanese consumer coach targets this consumer in japan and in areas with significant levels of japanese tourism the importance of japanese consumers is illustrated by a comparison of consumption levels per capita spending on handbags in japan is substantially greater than in the us coach’s more significant international wholesale customers include dickson concepts inc duty free shops and unisia   the following table shows the number of international retail stores international department store locations and other international locations at which coach products are sold    on july 1 2002 coach signed an agreement with case london ltd “case” for the

open up to 25 coach locations in the united kingdom case will develop a multi channel distribution strategy consistent with the successful coach model in the united states and japan in addition case assumed the responsibility of operating the existing coach store on sloane street and the coach shop in harrods in london   business to business as part of the indirect channel of distribution coach sells some of its products in selected military locations and through corporate incentive and giftgiving programs   licensing in our licensing relationships coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the coach brand the current licensing relationships as of june 29 2002 are as follows  products made under license are in most cases sold through all of the channels discussed above and with coach’s approval these licensees have the right to distribute coach brand products selectively through several other channels shoes in department store shoe salons furniture through baker’s own showrooms and watches in selected jewelry stores these venues provide additional yet controlled exposure of the coach brand coach’s licensing partners pay coach royalties on their sales of coach branded products however such royalties currently comprise less than 1 of coach’s revenues and are not material to the coach business the licensing agreements generally give coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved 10 manufacturing   coach has refined its production capabilities in coordination with the repositioning of its brand by shifting its production from owned domestic facilities to independent manufacturers in lowercost markets it can support a broader mix of product types materials and a seasonal influx of new more fashionoriented styles during fiscal year 2002 approximately 65 of coach’s net sales excluding factory store business were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year at the same time we help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory by designating a large number of the new styles as “limited editions” that are planned to be discontinued and replaced with fresh new products   coach has developed a flexible model that meets shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences it uses two main sources to make coach products outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its licensing partners all product sources must achieve and maintain coach’s high quality standards which are an integral part of the coach identity we monitor compliance with the quality control standards through onsite quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities one of coach’s keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware as it has moved its production to external sources coach still requires that these same raw materials are used in all of its products wherever they are made   approximately 95 of coach’s fiscal year 2002 nonlicensed product requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers measured as a percentage of total units produced coach buys independently manufactured products from a variety of countries including china costa rica mexico india italy spain hungary and turkey it operates a european sourcing and product development organization based in florence italy that works closely with the new yorkbased design team this broadbased multicountry manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost lead times and construction capabilities coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity quality and reliable delivery no one vendor provides more than 20 of coach’s total requirements before partnering with a vendor coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit periodic evaluations of existing previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis we believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with coach’s integrity standards   as part of the strategy to shift production to independent manufacturers in lowercost markets coach ceased operations at its remaining facility located in lares puerto rico in april 2002 in fiscal year 2002 this 66000 square foot facility contributed approximately 5 of production distribution   in july 1999 coach consolidated its worldwide warehousing distribution and repair functions into one location in jacksonville florida this highly automated computerized 560000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system coach’s distribution center employees use handheld optical scanners to read product bar codes which allows us to more accurately process and pack orders track shipments manage inventory and generally provide better service to its customers coach’s products are primarily shipped via federal express and common carriers to coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via federal express direct to consumers   the average order processing time is 2 to 3 days during coach’s peak season in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 coach shipped approximately 96 of all orders complete management information systems   the foundation of coach’s information systems is its enterprise resource planning system implemented in 1997 this fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting procurement inventory control sales and store replenishment resulting in increased efficiencies improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand the system functions as a central repository for all of coach’s transactional information resulting in increased efficiencies and greater inventory control this system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth 11   complementing its enterprise resource planning system are several other newlyimplemented system solutions each of which coach believes is wellsuited for its needs the data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting the supply chain management system supports corporate sales and inventory functions creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling productionprocurement with financial plans product fulfillment is facilitated by coach’s highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system while the unique requirements of coach’s catalog and internet businesses are supported by coach’s direct sales system finally the pointofsale system supports all instore transactions distributes management reporting to each store and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis this daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment all complementary systems are integrated with the central enterprise resource planning system trademarks and patents   coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production marketing and distribution of all of its products both in the us and in other countries in which the products are principally sold coach owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which coach products are sold its major trademarks include coach coach and lozenge design and coach and tag design and it has applications pending for a proprietary “c” signature fabric design  coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although coach believes that the coach name is important for its business in addition several of coach’s products are covered by design patents or patent applications coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through its network of investigators the coach hotline and business partners around the world   coach’s trademarks in the united states will remain in existence for as long as coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date coach has no material patents employees   as of june 29 2002 coach employed approximately 2900 people approximately 50 of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements of the total approximately 1600 are engaged in retail selling and administration positions approximately 500 are engaged in manufacturing sourcing or distribution functions and approximately 400 are employed through coach japan the remaining employees are engaged in other aspects of the coach business coach believes that its relations with its employees are good and it has never encountered a strike or significant work stoppage government regulation   most of coach’s imported products are subject to existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that coach may import into the us and other countries or may impact the cost of such products coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of its products in addition coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations risk factors   you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and in particular the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forwardlooking information in this document please also see “special note on forwardlooking information” on page 2 12 if coach is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business its future operating results will suffer   successful implementation of coach’s strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth to manage growth effectively coach will need to continue to increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict quality control coach will also need to continue to improve its operating systems to respond to any increased demand it could suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its products do not continue to meet its quality control standards or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in consumer demand for its products coach’s inability to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner could adversely affect its sales   coach’s success depends on its ability to identify originate and define product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner its products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change coach cannot assure that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future if coach misjudges the demand for its products it may incur increased costs due to excess inventories   if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products in addition because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’ orders it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated competition in the markets in which coach operates is intense and our competitors may develop products more popular with consumers   coach faces intense competition in the product lines and markets in which it operates coach’s products compete with other brands of products within their product category and with private label products sold by retailers including some of coach’s wholesale customers in its wholesale business coach competes with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of handbags accessories and other products for the limited space available for the display of these products to the consumer moreover the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which coach operates which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its competitive position and business some of coach’s competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than the company a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items which could adversely affect coach’s sales   many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry including among others general business conditions interest rates the availability of consumer credit taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items such as coach products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products such as the economic downturn in asia during 1997 may adversely affect coach’s sales coach’s business is subject to foreign exchange risk   coach sells products to its international wholesale customers including coach japan in us dollars however those distributors sell coach product in the relevant local currency currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international demand 13   in order to manage this risk coach japan enters into forward exchange contracts that allow them to obtain dollars at a rate that is set concurrent with the requisition of inventory as these contracts are entered into before the receipt of inventory the contract rate may be higher or lower than market rates when the goods are received and the payment is completed currently in accordance with gaap these contracts are fair valued ie markedtomarket at the end of each reporting period this noncash charge or credit can result in fluctuations in the reported financial results   coach consolidates the financial results of coach japan into its financial statements the functional currency of coach japan is the japanese yen these operating results are converted to us dollars based on the average exchange rate during the period and the balance sheet is converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period if coach loses key management or design personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business its operating results could suffer   coach’s performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams these executives and employees have substantial experience and expertise in coach’s business and have made significant contributions to its growth and success coach does not have employment agreements with any of its key executives or design personnel the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on coach’s business as the business grows coach will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and develop train and manage an increasing number of managementlevel sales and other employees coach cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future coach’s operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock   because coach products are frequently given as gifts coach has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in its sales and operating results over the past two fiscal years approximately 35 of coach’s annual sales and over 50 of its operating income were recognized in the second fiscal quarter which includes the holiday months of november and december coach’s gross profit may decrease if it becomes unable to obtain its products from or sell its products in other countries due to adverse international events that are beyond its control   in order to lower its sourcing costs and increase its gross profit coach has shifted its production to independent nonus manufacturers in lowercost markets coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues these factors among others could influence the ability of these independent manufacturers to make or export coach products costeffectively or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these products the violation of labor or other laws by any of coach’s independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical by coach or others in the us could damage coach’s reputation and force it to locate alternative manufacturing sources currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of raw materials for these independent manufacturers which they could pass along to coach resulting in higher costs and decreased margins for its products if any of these factors were to render a particular country undesirable or impractical as a source of supply there could be an adverse effect on coach’s business including its gross profit   coach’s failure to continue to increase sales of its products in international markets could adversely affect its gross profit international sales are subject to many risks including foreign governmental regulations foreign consumer preferences political unrest disruptions or delays in shipments to other nations and changes in local economic conditions these factors among others could influence coach’s ability to sell products successfully in international markets coach generally purchases products from international manufacturers in us dollars and sells these products in the us and to its international wholesale customers in us dollars 14 however coach’s international wholesale customers sell coach products in the relevant local currencies and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the products and result in decreased international consumer demand 

coach’s trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its products if coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights others may sell imitation brand products   coach believes that its registered and common law trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to create and sustain demand for coach products coach cannot assure you that it will not encounter trademark patent or trade dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and the geographic scope of its marketing coach also cannot assure that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its trademarks and proprietary rights by others the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and it may be more difficult for coach to successfully challenge the use of its proprietary rights by other parties in these countries provisions in coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party   coach’s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach’s board of directors coach’s charter permits its board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue in addition coach’s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares although coach’s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders   on may 3 2001 coach declared a “poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach’s common stock   subject to limited exceptions these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10 or more of coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10 or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors in this event each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the thencurrent market price subject to certain exceptions coach’s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that or the date on which a majority of coach’s board of directors becomes aware that a person has acquired 10 or more of the outstanding common stock we are currently aware of one institutional shareholder whose common stock holdings exceed the 10 threshold established by the rights plan this holder has been given permission to increase its ownership in the company to a maximum of 15 subject to certain exceptions before triggering the provision of the rights plan   coach’s bylaws can only be amended by coach’s board of directors coach’s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach’s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting by coach’s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach’s bylaws also under maryland law business combinations including issuances of equity securities between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a fiveyear period unless exempted in accordance with the statute after this period a combination of this type must be approved by two supermajority stockholder votes unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach’s board of directors coach’s 15 board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements 

  these and other provisions of maryland law or coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach’s stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion of coach’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach’s financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document overview   coach was founded in 1941 and was acquired by sara lee corporation in july 1985 in october 2000 coach was listed on the new york stock exchange and sold 170 million shares of stock in an initial public offering in april 2001 sara lee ended its ownership with a distribution of its remaining shares in coach via an exchange offer   coach is a designer and marketer of highquality modern american classic accessories coach’s primary product offerings include handbags women’s and men’s accessories business cases luggage and travel accessories personal planning products leather outerwear gloves and scarves   coach generates revenue by selling its products directly to consumers and indirectly through wholesale customers and by licensing its brand name to select manufacturers directtoconsumer sales consist of sales of coach products through its 138 companyoperated us retail stores 74 companyoperated us factory stores its direct mail catalogs and its ecommerce website indirect sales consist of sales of coach products to approximately 1400 department store and specialty retailer locations in the united states 118 international department store retail store factory store and dutyfree shop locations in 18 countries and 83 retail and department store locations managed by its joint venture coach japan inc coach generates additional wholesale sales through businesstobusiness programs in which companies purchase coach products to use as gifts or incentive rewards licensing revenues consist of royalties paid to coach under licensing arrangements with select partners for the sale of coach branded watches footwear and furniture   coach’s cost of sales consists of the costs associated with the sourcing of its products coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter these factors include changes in the mix of products it sells fluctuations in cost of materials and changes in the relative sales mix among its distribution channels   selling general and administrative expenses comprise four categories of expenses selling advertising marketing and design distribution and customer service and administration and information services selling expenses comprise store employee compensation store occupancy costs store supply costs wholesale account administration compensation and all coach japan operating expenses advertising marketing and design expenses include employee compensation media space and production advertising agency fees new product design costs as well as public relations market research expenses and mail order costs distribution and customer services expenses comprise warehousing order fulfillment shipping and handling customer service and bag repair costs administration and information services expenses comprise compensation costs for the information systems executive finance human resources and legal departments as well as consulting and software expenses selling general and administrative expenses are affected by the number of stores coach operates in any fiscal period and the relative proportions of retail and wholesale sales selling general and administrative expenses increase as coach and coach japan operate more stores although an increase in the number of stores generally enables them to spread the fixed portion of its selling general and administrative expenses over a larger sales base   as part of the transformation of coach’s business coach ceased production at the medley florida manufacturing facility in october 2000 this reorganization involved the termination of 362 manufacturing warehousing and management employees at the medley facility these actions reduced costs by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost thirdparty manufacturers 22   in april 2002 coach ceased production at the lares puerto rico manufacturing facility this reorganization involved the termination of 394 manufacturing warehousing and management employees at the lares facility these actions will reduce costs by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost thirdparty manufacturers   coach’s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to june 30 results of operations   the following is a discussion of the results of operations for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 along with a discussion of the changes in financial condition during fiscal 2002   this management’s discussion and analysis should be

follows    consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 are as follows  23     fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001   net sales   net sales increased by 198 to 7194 million in fiscal 2002 from 6005 million in fiscal 2001 these results reflect increased volume in both the directtoconsumer and indirect channels   direct net sales increased 141 to 4471 million in fiscal 2002 from 3918 million in fiscal 2001 the increase was primarily due to new store openings net sales from new retail and factory stores accounted for approximately 78 or 429 million of the increase in net sales since the end of fiscal 2001 coach opened 20 retail stores and six factory stores in addition comparable store sales growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full year was 43 and 34 which primarily represented the balance of the increase in net sales which was partially offset by the three retail stores that were closed during fiscal 2002   indirect net sales increased 305 to 2723 million in fiscal 2002 from 2087 million in fiscal 2001 this increase was driven primarily by the consolidation of coach japan and comparable store sales growth in japan coach japan sales to consumers are recorded at retail versus sales to the former distributors which were recorded at wholesale value the impact of coach japan accounted for approximately 55 million of the increase in net sales this increase is a result of the shift to retail from wholesale pricing which contributed approximately 37 million of the increase with the balance of this increase resulting from increased sales volume the international wholesale business was relatively consistent compared to the prior year the us wholesale category accounted for approximately 8 million of the increase in net sales offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately 4 million in the businesstobusiness category   gross profit   gross profit increased 265 to 4834 million in fiscal 2002 from 3820 million in fiscal 2001 gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points to 672 in fiscal 2002 from 636 in fiscal 2001 this improvement was driven by the consolidation of coach japan which contributed approximately 230 basis points there was a shift in product mix reflecting the continued diversification into nonleather fabrications with new and successful mixedmaterial collections this contributed approximately 100 basis points in addition gross margin benefited from the continuing impact of sourcing cost reductions which contributed 30 basis points 24   the following chart illustrates the gross margin performance we have experienced over the last eight quarters    selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased 256 to 3464 million in fiscal 2002 from 2757 million in fiscal 2001 selling general and administrative expenses increased to 481 as a percentage of net sales versus 459 in fiscal 2001   selling expenses increased by 409 to 2293 million or 319 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 1627 million or 271 of net sales in fiscal 2001 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to the operating costs associated with coach japan which were borne by former distributors in prior periods operating costs associated with coach japan totaled 466 million in fiscal 2002 included in these costs was a 33 million fair value adjustment for open foreign currency forward contracts also contributing to the increase was 201 million in operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores increased variable costs for comparable store sales store remodels costs to support the additional stores and store sales promotions to enhance sales   advertising marketing and design expenses decreased by 08 to 517 million or 72 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 522 million or 87 of net sales in fiscal 2001 the dollar decrease in these expenses was primarily due to the leveraging of costs through focused media placements as well as greater usage of postcards and direct mail   distribution and customer service expenses increased to 269 million in fiscal 2002 from 258 million in fiscal 2001 the dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes partially offset by efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility which resulted in a decline in the ratio to net sales from 43 in fiscal 2001 to 37 in fiscal 2002   administrative expenses increased to 385 million or 54 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 350 million or 58 of net sales in fiscal 2001 the absolute dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased staffing costs and consulting services related to coach becoming a standalone company offset by business interruption

fiscal 2002 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 this charge was reduced to 34 million this was primarily due to the complete disposition of the fixed assets in which proceeds exceeded original estimates by management this reorganization cost includes 22 million for worker separation costs 07 million for lease termination costs and 05 million for the writedown of longlived assets to net realizable value by june 29 2002 production ceased at the lares facility and disposition of the fixed assets and the termination of all employees had been completed 25   operating income   operating

stores were closed during fiscal 2001   indirect net sales attributable to united states and international wholesale shipments increased 124 to 2087 million in fiscal 2001 from 1857 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily due to strong gains in the international wholesale channel highlighted by continued doubledigit increases in comparable location sales to japanese consumers worldwide and increased demand for new products licensing revenue increased 235 to 22 million in fiscal 2001 from 18 million in fiscal 2000 due primarily to expanded distribution of licensed footwear product 26

administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased 54 to 2757 million in fiscal 2001 from 2616 million in fiscal 2000 selling general and administrative expenses decreased

distribution and customer service facility   administrative expenses decreased to 350 million or 58 of net sales in fiscal 2001 from 419 million or 78 of net sales in fiscal 2000 the decrease in these expenses was due to lower fringe benefit costs and lower performance based compensation expenses partially offset by higher occupancy costs associated with the lease renewal of our new york city corporate headquarters location and incremental expenses incurred to support new corporate governance activities relating to coach becoming publicly owned   reorganization costs   in the first fiscal quarter of 2001 management of coach committed to and announced a plan to cease production at the medley florida manufacturing facility in october 2000 this reorganization involved the termination of

expense increased 483 to 23 million or 04 of net sales in fiscal 2001 from 04 million or 01 of net sales in fiscal 2000 the increase was due to interest expense on the note payable to an affiliate of

facility previously provided by sara lee there was no interest expense incurred on the facility provided by sara lee in the prior year   income taxes   the effective tax rate increased to 356 in fiscal 2001 from 306 in fiscal 2000 this increase was caused by a lower percentage of income in fiscal 2001 attributable to companyowned offshore manufacturing which is taxed at lower rates   net

  the fleet facility contains various covenants and customary events of default coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception   the initial libor margin under the facility was 125 basis points for the year ended june 29 2002 the libor margin was 100 basis points reflecting an improvement in our fixedcharge coverage ratio under this revolving credit facility coach pays a commitment fee of 20 to 35 basis points based on any unused amounts the initial commitment fee was 30 basis points for the year ended june 29 2002 the commitment fee was 25 basis points   during fiscal 2002 the peak borrowings under the fleet facility were 469 million in fiscal 2001 the peak borrowings under the sara lee credit facility were 377 million as of june 29 2002 the borrowings under the fleet facility were fully repaid from operating cash flow the facility remains available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purpose   in order to provide funding for working capital the acquisition of distributors and general corporate purposes coach japan has entered into credit facilities with several japanese financial institutions these facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 67 billion yen or approximately 56 million at june 29 2002 interest is based on the tokyo interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points   these japanese facilities contain various covenants and customary events of default coach japan has been in compliance with all covenants since their inception coach inc is not a guarantor on these facilities   during fiscal 2002 the peak borrowings under the japanese credit facilities were 354 million as of june 29 2002 borrowings under the japanese revolving credit facility agreements were 342 million   on september 17 2001 the coach board of directors authorized the establishment of a common stock repurchase program under this program up to 80 million may be utilized to repurchase common stock through september 2004 purchases of coach stock may be made from time to time subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices through open market purchases repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general corporate and other uses coach may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time   during fiscal 2002 coach repurchased 09 million shares at an average cost of 1145 per share which were financed out of operating cash flows and borrowings under the credit facility which were repaid during fiscal 2002   during august 2002 coach repurchased 19 million shares at an average cost of 2592 per share the stock repurchases of approximately 50 million were financed out of cash on hand and operating cash flows as of august 30 2002 coach had expended approximately 60 million of the 80 million authorized to date under the stock repurchase program   coach opened 20 new us retail stores in fiscal 2002 as of june 29 2002 we completed our store renovation program which began in fiscal 1999 we expect that fiscal 2003 capital expenditures for new retail stores will be approximately 20 million and that capital expenditures for retail factory and department store renovations will be approximately 15 million we intend to finance these investments from internally generated cash flows or by using funds from our revolving credit facility   coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable in fiscal 2002 coach purchased approximately 253 million of inventory which was funded by operating cash flow and by borrowings under its revolving credit facility   management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs planned capital expenditures and the 29 common stock repurchase program any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments and to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond coach’s control 

  currently sara lee is a guarantor or a party to many of coach’s leases coach obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee but for which sara lee retains contingent liability coach is required to maintain the letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than 20 million coach has agreed to make efforts to remove sara lee from all of its existing leases and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases the initial letter of credit had a face amount of 206 million and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced as of june 2002 the letter of credit was reduced to 198 million we expect that it will be required to maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years   the following represents the scheduled maturities of coach’s longterm contractual obligations as june 29 2002    coach does not have any offbalancesheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes the valuation of financial instruments that are markedtomarket are based upon independent third party sources longterm debt   coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville facility this loan has a remaining balance of 37 million and bears interest at 877 principal and interest payments are made semiannually with the final payment due in 2014   tax rate   coach has completed the shutdown of its lares puerto rico manufacturing facility the shutdown eliminated the tax benefit coach has received under section 936 of the internal revenue code as a result in fiscal year 2003 it is anticipated that the effective tax rate will increase to approximately 37   seasonality   because its products are frequently given as gifts coach has historically realized and expects to continue to realize higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year which includes the holiday months of november and december we anticipate that our sales and operating profit will continue to be seasonal in nature critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions predicting future events 30 is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgement actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgements and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements 

  in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods coach’s more significant policies where alternative methods are available include accounting for stock options and inventories for more information on coach’s accounting policies please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements other critical accounting policies are as follows   inventories   us inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined by the firstin firstout method or market inventories in japan are valued at the lower of cost determined by the lastin firstout method or market inventory costs include material conversion costs freight and duties reserves for slow moving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand we evaluate the adequacy of reserves quarterly a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach’s evaluation of its slow moving and aged merchandise   valuation of longlived assets   longlived assets other than intangible assets and goodwill primarily include property and equipment longlived assets being retained for use by coach are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred the loss would be recognized during the period the impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values giving consideration to recent operating performance prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “sfas 142” discussed in new accounting standards we included intangible assets and goodwill as a component of the longlived asset categories reviewed for impairment as discussed above subsequent to the adoption of sfas 142 indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill were reviewed for impairment in accordance with the new accounting standards   longlived assets that are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell reductions in carrying value are recognized in the period in which management commits to a plan to dispose of the assets however our estimates project cash flows several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation real estate markets and economic conditions   revenue recognition   sales are recognized at the point of sale which occurs when merchandise is sold in an overthecounter consumer transaction or for the wholesale channels upon shipment of merchandise when title passes to the customer allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee   new accounting standards   in april 2001 the emerging issues task force “eitf” of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” reached a final consensus on issue 0025 “accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor’s products” in november 2001 eitf 0025 was codified in eitf 0109 this issue addresses the recognition measurement and income statement classification of consideration provided to distributors or retailers previously coach had recorded these activities within selling general and administrative expenses coach adopted eitf 0025 in the first 31 quarter of fiscal 2002 in connection with this adoption prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation the effect of the adoption resulted in a reclassification from selling general and administrative expense to a reduction in net sales of 156 million for fiscal 2001 and 112 million for fiscal 2000
