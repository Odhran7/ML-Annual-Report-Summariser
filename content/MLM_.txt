business segment information

the company conducts its building materials business through two reportable segments organized by geography east group and west group the east group provides aggregates and asphalt products only the west group provides aggregates cement and downstream products the ten largest revenuegenerating states accounted for 84 of the building materials business total revenues in 2021 texas colorado north carolina georgia minnesota iowa florida south carolina indiana and maryland the company’s magnesia specialties business is reported as a separate segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses for more information on the organization and geographic area of the company’s business segments see “ note a accounting policies ” and “ note p segments ” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k this form 10k which information is incorporated by reference 

building materials business

the profitability of the building materials business which serves customers in the construction marketplace is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

geographic employment and population dynamics the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors  as are much of the building materials business’s operations  therefore erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions including precipitation flooding hurricanes snowstorms extreme temperatures  wildfires  earthquakes and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation 

the building materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with 34 of its 2021 organic aggregates shipments sold to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its organic shipments sold primarily to contractors for nonresidential and residential construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments 

funding of public infrastructure historically the company’s largest enduse market is discussed in greater detail under “ building materials business’ key considerations—public infrastructure ” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ’’ of this form 10k 

the building materials business covers a wide geographic area the five largest revenuegenerating states determined by state of destination texas colorado north carolina georgia and minnesota accounted for 68 of the building materials business’ total revenues by state of destination in 2021 the building materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time in 2020 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic impacted the global economy the company being considered an essential business continued to operate but experienced a modest decline in aggregates shipments in 2020 due to a slowdown in overall construction activity and only modest growth in organic aggregates shipments in 2021

aggregates

aggregates consisting of crushed stone sand and gravel are an engineered granular material that is manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the east group

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule the distance covered by truck shipments from an individual quarry is limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a waterborne network where the permile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers’ construction sites or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

the company’s distribution network moves aggregates materials from certain domestic and offshore sources via its longhaul rail and waterborne distribution network to markets where aggregates supply is limited the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s locations in the bahamas and nova scotia transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2021 the company’s aggregates distribution facilities consisted of 84 terminals the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of their aggregates products the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets however the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability railcar availability locomotive availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including among other items meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregates mines production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregates deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess marketplace transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the industry’s consolidation when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance pit development or other standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized acquisition opportunities include public and large private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balance sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s longterm strategic plans commonly referred to as soar strategic operating analysis and review which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets  

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves

management believes its aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in obtaining reserves used for production the company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 78 years based on current production levels however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations  

the company generally sells its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of customer orders or requests the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

cement and downstream operations

cement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these plants which produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual clinker capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 76 utilization in 2021 the midlothian plant permit allows the company to expand production by up to 08 million additional tons in 2021 as part of the lehigh west region acquisition the company acquired two cement production facilities including one in redding california and one in tehachapi california and several cement distribution terminals these operations are classified as assets held for sale as of december 31 2021 calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its texas cement production plants and more than 50 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its california cement production plants 

the cement operations of the building materials business produce portland and specialty cements similar to aggregates cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector  

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october approximately 70 to 75 of all cement shipments are sent to ready mixed concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concreterelated products contractors materials dealers and oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

energy accounted for approximately 23 of the cement production cost profile in 2021 therefore profitability of cement is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal and natural gas but also consumes alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement operations is also impacted by kiln maintenance which typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on companyowned property adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

the cement operations generally deliver their products upon receipt of customer orders or requests inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily consisting of cement aggregates sand and water is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines such as dirt and clay the company operates 150 ready mix plants in texas colorado california arizona and wyoming the california ready mixed concrete operations are classified as assets held for sale as of december 31 2021 asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company operates 35 asphalt plants in arizona california colorado and minnesota the company also provides paving services in colorado and california market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement 

the cement and downstream operations results are affected by volatile factors including energyrelated costs operating efficiencies and weather to a greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results 

magnesia specialties business

the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility and manufactures magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee michigan facility these magnesiabased chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2021 69 of magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products 30 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials

in 2021 76 of the lime produced in the magnesia specialties business was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 24 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry in 2021 34 of the magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to products used in the steel industry primarily dolomitic lime   accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization according to the federal reserve domestic capacity utilization averaged 81 in 2021 versus 65 in 2020 which was negatively impacted by covid19 

in the magnesia specialties business a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for approximately 64 of its 2022 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs for 2021 the company’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet of natural gas increased 21 versus 2020 

given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing efficiency enhancements rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly these products are not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line demand for chemicals products recovered in 2021 after being negatively impacted by covid19 in 2020

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesiumrich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

patents and trademarks

as of january 31 2022 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and trademarks related to its business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole

customers

no material part of the business as a whole or of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof

competition

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its products due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build and maintain production facilities crushed stone production from quarries or mines and sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic cement producers are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some concrete markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large verticallyintegrated companies with facilities in many markets 

the company operates in a largelyfragmented industry with over 5000 domestic aggregates producers including large public companies and a large number of small privatelyheld companies other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following















due to the localized nature of the industry resulting from the high cost of transportation relative to the price of the product the building materials business primarily operates in smaller distinct areas that can vary from one another

capacity for cement plants is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity clinker is the initial product of cement production according to the us geological survey united states cement production is widely dispersed with the top five companies collectively producing approximately 58 of us clinker capacity an estimated 83 of us clinker capacity is owned by 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

companies headquartered outside of the united states the company’s cement operations also compete with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in texas and california  

the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators large and small 

the company believes that its ability to transport materials by rail and waterborne vessels has enhanced its ability to compete in the building materials industry 

the magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products while the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2021 were predominantly domestic a portion was derived from customers located outside the united states 

environmental and governmental regulations 

overview

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use mining air emissions including co 2 and other greenhouse gases water use allocation and discharges waste management noise and dust exposure control reclamation and other environmental health and safety and regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation

environmental compliance and accruals

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a fulltime team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 310 million in 2021 and 328 million in 2020 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 120 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately 180 million in each of 2022 and 2023 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2021 and 2020 however the company’s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite the company’s compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the company’s businesses and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future complying with governmental and environmental regulations did not have and is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings and competitive position other than as discussed in this section 

many of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may in the ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws moreover the company does not separate the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes as such an allocation would be arbitrary the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust ckd this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices since much of the ckd is unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and their attendant regulations are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts in addition new laws are also adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process typically takes years to finalize and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements included under item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k and the “environmental regulation and litigation” section included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

mine safety and land reclamation

in general mining production and distribution facilities for aggregates cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality water quality and other environmental regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as the company locates and acquires new production and distribution facilities the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines production and distribution facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine production and distribution facilities can be situated at a substantial distance from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations

as is the case with other similarly situated companies some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration msha and the occupational safety and health administration osha have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the required levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree interest rate the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “ note o commitments and contingencies ” of the “ notes to financial statements ” of the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k the company performs activities on an ongoing basis as an integral part of the normal quarrying process that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets both safety regulations required by msha for ongoing operations as well as final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are from time to time available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs  or have been converted for recreational use by the local community 

greenhouse gases and climate change

we have identified certain risks and opportunities below with respect to the physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy 

policy and regulatory matters a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for greenhouse gas ghg emissions reporting or reductions the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the united states the united states environmental protection agency usepa promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of ghgs report those emissions the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business release carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime magnesium oxide and hydroxide products the company’s two magnesiabased chemicals facilities as well as its two cement plants in texas and two newlyacquired cement plants in california file annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa reporting rule the primary operations of the company however including its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not socalled “major” sources of ghg emissions subject to the usepa reporting rule in fact most of the ghg emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment 

in 2010 the usepa also issued a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v operating permit programs the us supreme court ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the best available control technology bact requirements for ghgs emitted by sources already subject to psd or title v permitting requirements for other pollutants the company’s cement plants as well as its magnesia specialties plants hold title v permits and each other than the redding california cement plant and the manistee michigan facility is also subject to psd requirements with the change of the us presidential administration in 2021 it is currently unclear whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of the tailoring rule or proceed otherwise it is also unknown how the usepa may revise bact requirements in fact although several largescale projects for carbon capture are in the development phase no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs have yet been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency thus if future modifications to our facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg bact requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs however it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements

us president biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making climate change central to us policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings president biden reentered the paris agreement in january 2021 and later announced the united states’ reduction commitments under the paris agreement including a 50 to 52 economywide reduction in net ghg emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 more recently president biden set out a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions known as the global methane pledge to reduce global methane emissions by 30 from 2020 levels by the end of the decade in november 2021 president biden signed into law the infrastructure investment and jobs act the “iij act” which provides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended in part to address climate change including road bridge and other major infrastructure projects in addition the currentlyproposed build back better bill the “bbb bill” calls for significant us government investments in the commercialization and scaleup of energy and climate technologies as well as tax credits for businesses that invest in clean energy although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement these orders commitments and laws or the full scope timing or ramifications of such measures it is clear that the current administration intends and has already begun to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and like other signatories to the paris agreement intends to pursue a goal of a net zero ghg by 2050 these measures combined with democratic control of both chambers of the 117 th us congress also suggest that additional executive andor legislative action is reasonably likely although the timing and scope of such action is unclear it also seems probable that the usepa and other agencies will use their rulemaking authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change various states where the company has operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed the company’s cement plants in california have not taken part in the auctions because the state previously allocated emission rights free of charge to the cement industry which 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

have been sufficient for operations to date the company will continue to monitor the capandtrade program closely as part of its production planning to assess the impact of potentially stricter requirements in the future andor the need to purchase rights to emit ghgs in california 

if and when the usepa issues new regulations andor congress passes additional legislation restricting ghgs emissions the woodville ohio and manistee michigan magnesia specialties operations as well as the company’s cement plants in texas and california which release co 2 in certain of their processes and use carbonbased fuels for power equipment kilns and the company’s mobile fleet will likely be subject to any new requirements the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement facilities would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation however compete against other products that due to the form andor structure of the source material require less energy in the calcination process resulting in the generation of fewer ghgs per ton of production due to ghg emissions requirements the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs including for taxes or capital investments in order to maintain competitive pricing in that market in addition the cement produced by the company’s cement plants like other us operators is subject to strict limits set by the us department of transportation usdot and other agencies including those relating to “clinker substitution” or the replacement of ground clinker in cement with alternate materials such as pozzolan slag and fly ash which has implications for the company’s fuel use and efforts to reduce ghg emissions from its cement operations for example various industry associations are engaged in an effort to ask the usdot and other agencies to revise their standards allowing for greater rates of clinker substitution similar to the rates currently permitted for european cement producers if higher rates of substitution and blending are in fact permitted in the future the result is likely to be both reduced clinker and power consumption in cement production which would in turn reduce ghgs emitted in connection with each ton of cement produced in the united states

in light of the various regulatory uncertainties the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be nonetheless the company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties business or building materials business the company’s four cement plants like those of other cement operators require combustion of significant amounts of fuel to generate high kiln temperatures and creates carbon dioxide as a product of the calcination process which is an unavoidable step in making cement clinker accordingly the company continues to closely monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on the company’s cement business financial condition and product demand the company does not currently expect the impact to the cement business to be material to the company

physical impacts in addition to impacts from increased regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states notably the carolinas florida and georgia where it impacted the company’s facilities in california and arizona continuing drought has led to water use restrictions in numerous water districts and insufficient supply of water for our operations in those areas could impact production 

other transition risks and opportunities the company’s businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels the company could incur increased costs or disruptions in its operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of electricity or fuels or other materials used in its operations these and other climaterelated risks such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather high precipitation or other changes in weather also could impact the company’s customers which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks 

notwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change there may also be opportunities for the company to increase its business or revenues both in terms of the physical impacts of climate change and market opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy for example warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively which could have meaningful positive impacts on the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively from a regulatory standpoint as noted

above the recentlypassed iij act provides billions of dollars in new funding for roads bridge and other major infrastructure projects this may result in new public transit and clean energy projects that address climate change  in addition the company’s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries including both coal and gasfired electricity generation which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and ghg emissions by more ghgintense companies finally the desire for sustainable building solutions has led to greater recognition of the benefits of concrete construction in the effort to move to a circular economy thorough innovative products longevity and recyclability and increased demand for green construction projects would have a direct impact on the company’s cement and concrete business 

organization and governance the company’s board of directors plays an essential role in determining strategic priorities and considers sustainability issues an integral part of its business oversight the company established an ethics environment safety and health eesh committee in 1994 which today meets at least three times annually and receives reports directly from management relating to environmental safety ethics and other sustainability matters including ghg and climate matters the eesh committee reports to the full board and number of other board committees have overlapping responsibility for sustainability matters management receives at least quarterly updates from operating personnel directly responsible for compliance relating to eesh matters the company’s sustainability function is led by a head of sustainability who reports to the executive vice president and general counsel on climate and other sustainability matters the company believes the above approach has been effective in integrating sustainability as a core element of its corporate governance  

in an effort to mitigate the risks to the company associated with ghg emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability the company has adopted a corporatewide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate ghg reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies including using alternative fuels such as biodiesel reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems rightsizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips replacing older railcars with more efficient highcapacity models that reduce the number of required trips adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements and installing stateoftheart emissions control equipment at one of the company’s magnesia plants and tire processing systems for fuel as well as a larger natural gas line at one of the company’s cement plants the company’s midlothian cement plant has been recognized by the usepa as a highperforming energyefficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels 

land management

the company owns approximately 170000 acres of land the vast majority of which is used in connection with active facilities the company regularly reviews its land holdings to determine their highest and best use based on its management expertise and sell or develop for sale surplus property land holdings that do not have economically recoverable reserves for current or future mining or are otherwise not in locations that complement the company’s operating facilities are considered as candidates for sale 

human capital resources 

as of january 31 2022 the company has approximately 10000 employees of which approximately 7600 are hourly employees and approximately 2400 are salaried employees approximately 1400 hourly employees 14 of the company’s employees are represented by labor unions representing 19  of the building materials business’ hourly employees and 100  of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees the company’s principal union contracts for the magnesia specialties business cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the woodville and manistee collective bargaining agreements expire june 2022 and august 2027 respectively the company believes it has good relations with its employees including its unionized workforce while the company’s management does not expect material difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations 

management believes the company’s success depends on its ability to attract develop and retain key personnel none of martin marietta’s accomplishments are possible without its employees the people who both drive the work and are most affected by it these individuals are the heart of martin marietta the company’s management oversees various employee initiatives to foster and improve its employees and the management development and compensation committee regularly reviews the compensation program to achieve those objectives in 2020 the company also launched an inclusion and engagement task force comprised of employees with diverse race gender background and experience which is focused on hiring developing and retaining diverse employees to strengthen our talent pipeline and increase employee engagement and retention

industry and covid19 risk factors

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects as a result of these issues several of our top revenuegenerating states from time to time stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments

we sell most of our aggregates our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry and therefore our results depend on that industry’s strength since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s the great recession was an example and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their selling price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in the building materials business’ top five revenuegenerating states of texas colorado north carolina georgia and minnesota our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation during the great recession

the great recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry subsequent to the great recession and until the impact from covid19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced slowbutsteady construction growth that coincided with the longest economic recovery in united states history 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation fast act we expect that the passage of the infrastructure investment and jobs act the iij act should provide funding visibility for the foreseeable future

our building materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather which can significantly impact operations

since the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow heavy or sustained rainfall wildfires and earthquakes reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production production and shipment levels of the building materials business’ products follow activity in the construction industry which typically are strongest in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s building materials business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather and thus are generally the least profitable and are more profitable if the impact of winter weather is less the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the company’s california operations are at risk for wildfire activity and water use restrictions given ongoing severe drought conditions

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

our businesses could be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic or any other outbreak of disease epidemic or pandemic or similar public health threat or fear of such an event and its related economic and societal response 

our businesses could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions in or around december 2019 covid19 was initially reported four months later in march 2020 the world health organization declared it a global pandemic the proliferation of covid19 cases in the united states and the extent that geography of outbreaks primarily matches the regions in which the company’s building materials business principally operates can negatively impact economic activity consumer confidence and discretionary spending and overall market conditions further covid19 could continue to negatively affect the health of our employees employee productivity customer purchasing patterns and fulfillment of purchase orders availability of supplies pricing for raw materials and the ability to transport materials via the company’s distribution network while our operations have been designated as “essential” under applicable government orders otherwise restricting business activities to prevent further outbreak of covid19 and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate the company continues to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations including any that may be required by federal state or local authorities or that the company determines are in the best interests of its employees customers suppliers vendors communities and other stakeholders demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market is affected by federal state and local budget and deficit issues remote working trends are reducing miles driven which can have a negative impact on various revenue streams that fund roadway projects further delays or cancellations of projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets which combined accounted for 61 of aggregates shipments for the year ended december 31 2021 could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

competition and growth risk factors

our building materials business depends on the availability of quality aggregates reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically

our challenge is to find quality aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve applicable markets as communities have grown they have settled in and around attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods including rail and water while our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical we can give no assurances that we will be successful at this strategy

our businesses face many competitors

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used in certain applications instead of new products and our cement operations may compete with international competitors who are importing products into the united states from jurisdictions with lower production and regulatory costs

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and we may acquire businesses by paying all or in part with shares of our common stock

we expect to continue to grow in part by acquiring other businesses in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company grow however the continued 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing longterm shareholder return

our integration of the acquisition or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations however in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to undertake may require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations based on our history we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include















our acquisitions could harm our results of operations

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that















 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

 

our cement and magnesia specialties businesses may become capacityconstrained

if our cement or magnesia specialties businesses becomes capacityconstrained we may be unable to timely satisfy the demand for some of our products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity further particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacityconstrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize while we are permitted to expand production by up to 08 million additional tons at our midlothian cement plant it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition 

our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the united states in violation of us fair trade laws

in the past the cement industry has obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement product line

economic political and legal risk factors

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment health and safety and other areas of the law as well as litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including carbon dioxide and other ghgs water use allocation and discharges waste management noise and dust control mining land reclamation and other environmental health and safety matters govern our operations some of our operations require permits which may impose additional operating standards and are subject to modification renewal and revocation certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations the risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses these potential liabilities could result in material costs including fines or personal injury or damages claims which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 

future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs we could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials explosives products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties to investigate or cleanup such contamination 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition  an unexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our company 

climate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business including potential physical and financial impacts

a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for ghg emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the united states the usepa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering ghg emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the usepa has also promulgated a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the tailoring rule which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act although the us supreme court subsequently ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the bact requirements for ghgs emitted by sources that already require title v operating permits or are subject to psd requirements for other pollutants with the change of the us presidential administration in 2021 it is currently unclear whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of the tailoring rule or proceed in a different direction nor is it known how the usepa may revise the bact requirements if future modifications to our magnesia specialties or cement facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg permitting requirements may also be triggered which could require us to incur significant additional costs it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any future requirements at this time

us president biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making climate change central to us policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings president biden reentered the paris agreement in january 2021 and later announced the united states’ reduction commitments under the paris agreement including a 50 to 52 economywide reduction in net ghg emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 more recently president biden set out a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions known as the global methane pledge to reduce global methane emissions by 30 from 2020 levels by the end of the decade in november 2021 president signed into law the iij act which provides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended in part to address climate change including road bridge and other major infrastructure projects in addition the currentlyproposed build back better bill calls for significant us government investments in the commercialization and scaleup of energy and climate technologies as well as tax credits for businesses that invest in clean energy although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement these orders commitments and laws or the full scope timing or ramifications of such measures it is clear that the administration intends and has begun to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and like other signatories to the paris agreement intends to pursue a goal of a net zero ghg by 2050 these measures combined with democratic control of both chambers of the us congress also suggest that additional executive andor legislative action is likely although the timing and scope of such action is unclear additionally it seems probable that the usepa and other agencies will use their rulemaking authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change various states where we have operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well and we may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed for example california has had a capandtrade program for emissions rights since 2012 in light of the various regulatory uncertainties we cannot at this time reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be but we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties business or building materials business we continue to monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business financial condition and product demand

although our aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are not socalled “major” sources of ghg emissions subject to the usepa reporting rule any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact our magnesiabased chemicals operations in woodville ohio and manistee michigan as well as our two cement plants in texas and our two cement plants in california each of which currently file annual reports of ghg emissions as required by the usepa reporting rule however it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time in addition we may not be able to recover any increased operating costs taxes or capital investments other than with respect to any carbon reduction or capture technologies relating to ghg emission limitations at those plants from our customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

in addition to impacts from increased ghg and other climaterelated regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on our operations or financial condition given the nature of our operations physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials b usiness correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by our operations in particular our operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in addition our california operations are at risk for wildfires which is exacerbated by prolonged drought which may also result in water restrictions increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events have been linked to climate change and further global warming may increase the risk of adverse weather conditions climate and inclement weather can also reduce the useful life of an asset 

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather high precipitation or other changes in weather could impact our customers which could lead to reduced demand for our products we may not be able to pass on to our customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks

the overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources

our products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the fixing america’s surface transportation or fast act which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs further clarification was provided with the passage of the 1 trillion iij act in november 2021 which contains a fiveyear surface transportation reauthorization plus 110 billion in new funding for roads bridges and other hard infrastructure projects at the federal level we expect to see stable infrastructure spending in 2022 with more meaningful impact from the iij act beginning in 2023 further we continue to expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state and local levels in 2022 aided by 10 billion for state departments of transportation provided by the december 2020 federal stimulus package as well as 14 billion of approved ballot initiatives we cannot be assured however of the amount and timing of appropriations for spending on infrastructure projects

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates

our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore our business in these industries may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

notably demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregates products is affected by interest rates which are currently at historically low levels there can be no assurance however that interest rates will not increase in the future affecting our business in an adverse manner the residential construction market accounted for 25 of our organic aggregates shipments in 2021 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

increases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including





















any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

personnel risks

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses

labor unions represent approximately 14 of the hourly employees of our building materials business and all of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in and june 2022 and august 2027 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of and on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel and executive officers including qualified management technical marketing and sales and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution

investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions

financial accounting and cost management risk factors 

our business is a capitalintensive business

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read the critical accounting policies and estimates section included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the form 10k 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are periodically changed new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a  accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s pcaob inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits our costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results

goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated for impairment by management at least annually if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a noncash charge to earnings if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a noncash charge to earnings future events may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to lower than forecasted revenues actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions actions of key customers increases in discount rates continued economic uncertainty higher levels of unemployment weak consumer confidence lower levels of discretionary consumer spending a decrease in royalty rates and a decline in the trading price of our common stock we continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly we may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to our business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market have historically been negatively affected by federal and state budget challenges and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels further delays or cancellations to capital 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers as well as state lien rights nevertheless we may experience a delay in payment from some of our customers during a construction downturn which would negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate

the credit environment could impact our ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt it is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue new equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investmentgrade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on any variablerate debt including the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels also while we believe the company will continue to have adequate credit available to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas activities

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products outside the united states therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of planned maintenance failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2021 the cement and magnesia specialties operations incurred shutdown costs of 236 million and 55 million respectively any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time

our paving operations present additional risks to our business

our paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixedprice contracts we guarantee project completion by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our paving operations we also have fixedprice and fixedunitprice contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contracts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are projects that are short in duration 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement operations due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore if we expand these operations our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 105 for 2021 and 109 for 2020

suppliers raw materials and energy costs risk factors

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have historically been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy changes in energy costs also affect the prices that we pay for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we may enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk

our magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for approximately 64 of its 2022 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs the cement operations have fixedprice agreements for a portion of their 2022 coal and natural gas needs

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 23 of the 2021 direct production costs of our cement operations therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement operations 

similarly our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials 

cement is sensitive to supply and price volatility

cement competition is often based primarily on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally decline we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

cyber and information security risk factors 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the company’s computer systems and networks certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its thirdparty vendors cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct largescale complex automated attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises in particular the company is increasingly relying on its it infrastructure to support its operations as it manages the impact of covid19 including supporting remotework protocols in regions impacted by the spread of covid19 which can increase cyber risks the company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss in addition it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or thirdparty vendors

breaches of the company’s technology systems or those of the company’s vendors and customers whether from circumvention of security systems denialof service attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering vendor software supply chain compromises physical breaches or other actions have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ and customers’ websites applications data processing and certain products and services or disruption of other business operations furthermore any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about the company’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft breaches of the company’s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm measures that the company takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training organizational investments incident response plans table top exercises and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems products and services or those of the company’s third parties could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company the report rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results even if no breach has been attempted or occurred any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition

the company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws

the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa which came into effect in january 2020 provides among other things a new private right of action for data breaches requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and provides consumers with additional rights the california privacy rights and enforcement act which will become effective on january 1 2023 amends and expands the ccpa creating new industry requirements consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms similarly to conduct certain of its operations the company moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to the company is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches the companys reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the company fails or is perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time privacy laws that may be implemented in the future will continue to require changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs or may result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and may subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that the company modify or cease existing business practices

other risk factors

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or water we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs

the availability of railcars can also affect our ability to transport our products railcars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease railcars for use in other industries we may not have enough railcars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

some of our products are distributed by barges along rivers in ohio and west virginia we may experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following

the company uses various exploratory drilling methods depending on the type of aggregates to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies depending on the complexity of the mineral deposit and whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by reputable third parties subsequent to drilling selected drill samples are tested by an accredited laboratory for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable they are either leased or purchased once in operation routine quality control testing is performed to ensure the quality grade of aggregate continues to meet specifications

the company estimates proven and probable aggregates reserves based on the results of drilling and testing completed by or under the supervision of qualified persons proven reserves are the portion of mineral deposits for which quantity and quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geologic evidence and sampling using closely spaced drill data proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are estimated utilizing fewer drill holes but geologic evidence and sampling is considered adequate for determining quality and quantity the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in addition to reserves the company estimates resources for mineral deposits demonstrating reasonable prospects of being economically mineable in the future 

in determining the amount of reserves evaluations are completed by or under the supervision of qualified company personnel using industry best practices and internal controls defined by the company reserve estimates represent net tons after consideration of applicable losses incurred during mining and plant processing the company’s policy is to exclude from reserve estimates the portions of a mineral deposit that are not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement operations as it does for its aggregates operations for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates  property plant and equipment ” included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k while the mineral reserve and resource classification categories proven and probable identify relative confidence of reserve estimates there is inherent risk associated with such estimates the company bases estimates on the information known at the time of determination and regularly reevaluates reserves whenever new information indicates a material change in reserves at one of the company’s sites 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and specialuse permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners

business environment 

building materials business 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics 

the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore erratic weather patterns precipitation and other weatherrelated conditions including flooding hurricanes precipitation cold temperatures earthquakes droughts and wildfires can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters can be subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation the impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the building materials business’ key considerations section 

product lines

enduse trends





♦ total value of construction put in place increased 8 

♦ public construction spending decreased 4 

♦ private nonresidential construction market spending decreased 2 

♦ private residential construction market spending increased 23 

the principal enduse markets of the building materials business are public infrastructure ie highways streets roads bridges and schools nonresidential construction ie manufacturing and distribution facilities industrial complexes office buildings large retailers and wholesalers healthcare hospitality and energyrelated activity and residential construction ie subdivision development and single and multifamily housing aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast collectively comprising the chemrockrail market 

public infrastructure projects can require several years to complete while residential and nonresidential construction projects are usually completed within one year generally customer purchase orders do not contain firm quantity commitments regardless of enduse market therefore management does not utilize a company backlog in managing its business  

the public infrastructure market accounted for 34 of the company’s organic aggregates shipments in 2021 contractor capacity constraints project delays in several markets and weather were primary factors for the 2 shipment decline to this end use the company’s shipments to this enduse market remain below the most recent fiveyear average of 37 and tenyear average of 40 

while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles  the historic level of spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable due to the predictability of funding from

federal state and local governments  the infrastructure investments and jobs act  iij act  was signed into law on november 15 2021 and contains a fiveyear surface transportation reauthorization plus  110 billion in new funding for roads bridges and other hard infrastructure projects 

public construction projects once awarded are typically seen through to completion thus delays from weather or other factors can serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding in november 2021 245 state and local ballot initiatives or 89 of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote were approved the approved infrastructure initiatives are estimated to generate nearly 7 billion in onetime and recurring revenues with initiatives in texas the company’s largest revenuegenerating state accounting for over 5 billion of this total 

the nonresidential construction market accounted for 35 of the company’s organic aggregates shipments in 2021 which increased 8 over 2020 reflecting increased distribution centerwarehouse projects the dodge momentum index a twelvemonth leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgrawhill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 was 1664 in december 2021 an increase of 23 from december 2020 this represented the strongest annual gain since 2005 suggesting positive momentum in the nonresidential construction sector at the onset of 2022 

 

the residential construction market accounted for 25 of the company’s organic aggregates shipments in 2021 and increased 8 compared with 2020 this end use typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles the company’s exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions including streets sidewalks utilities and storm and sewage drainage singlefamily homes and multifamily units construction of both subdivisions and singlefamily homes is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than construction of multifamily units therefore the timing of new subdivision starts as well as new singlefamily housing permits are strong indicators of residential volumes for the year ended december 31 2021 not seasonally adjusted residential housing starts increased 16 to 16 million units compared with 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 not seasonally adjusted national housing permits increased 17 versus 2020 the company expects continued growth in the residential market driven by undersupply favorable demographics driven by millennials entry into the housing market job growth deurbanization land availability and efficient permitting 

the remaining 6 of the company’s 2021 organic aggregates shipm ents was to the chemrockrail market which includes ballast and agricultural limestone ballast is an aggregates product used to stabilize railroad track beds and increasingly concrete rail ties are being used as a substitute for wooden ties agricultural lime a highcalcium carbonate material is used as a supplement in animal feed a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer additionally chemrockrail includes rip rap which is used as a stabilizing material to control erosion caused by water runoff at embankments ocean beaches inlets rivers and streams and highcalcium limestone which is used as filler in glass plastic paint rubber adhesives grease and paper chemicalgrade highcalcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants

pricing trends 

materials pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreedupon price during a definitive period since infrastructure projects span multiple years announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the company sells products under existing price agreements pricing escalators included in multiyear infrastructure contracts serve to somewhat mitigate this effect however during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs multiyear infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth additionally the company may implement midyear price increases on a marketbymarket basis where appropriate pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market for further information on pricing see the discussion below in the “financial overview” section

 

cost structure 

direct production costs for the building materials business are components of cost of revenues incurred at the quarries mines cement plants ready mixed concrete plants asphalt plants and paving operations and distribution yards and facilities cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility and production overhead costs 

g enerally the significant components of direct production costs for the building materials business are 1 labor and related benefits 2 raw materials 3 depreciation depletion and amortization 4 repairs and maintenance 5 contract services 6 supplies and 7 energy in 2021 these categories represented 90 of the building materials business’ total direct production costs 

production is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours further components of energy supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume accordingly the company’s operating leverage can be substantial

generally when the company invests capital in facilities and equipment increased capacity and productivity along with reduced labor and repair costs can offset increased fixed depreciation costs however the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lowerdemand environment resulting in under absorption of fixed costs 

wage and benefit inflation and increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy further workforce reductions resulting from process automation and mobile fleet rightsizing primarily in the aggregates operations have mitigated rising labor costs during economic downturns the company reviews its operations and where practical temporarily idles certain sites the company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close proximity in certain markets management can create production “super crews” that work on a rotating basis at various locations for example within a market a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry this has allowed the company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand 

the production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt requires the use of cement and liquid asphalt raw materials respectively therefore fluctuations in availability and prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results 

cement production is a capitalintensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate continuously with the exception of maintenance shutdowns kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2021 and 2020 the cement operations incurred outage costs of 236 million and 197 million respectively the increase in outage costs in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily attributable to the timing of planned kiln outages the company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns 

typically diesel fuel represents the single largest component of energy costs for the building materials business the average cost per gallon was 236 and 149 in 2021 and 2020 respectively changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires further the company’s contracts of affreightment for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range 

historically the company has achieved pricing growth in periods of inflation based on its ability to increase its selling prices in a normal economic environment

northern and southern california

through the lehigh west region platform acquisition in 2021 the company established positions in both the northern and southern california megaregions 

the northern california megaregion encompasses san francisco sacramento san jose and oakland and represents one of the fastestgrowing economies in the united states since 2010 driven by silicon valley home to some of the world’s most valuable companies including apple alphabet and meta platforms formerly facebook this megaregion is home to approximately 13 million people

iowa 

iowa has been a top and steady martin marietta revenuegenerating state for decades and has historically experienced a stable and resilient economy iowa is the nation’s largest corn and porkproducing state and provides approximately 9 of america’s food supply the company’s agricultural lime shipments are dependent on among other things weather demand for agricultural commodities including corn and soybeans commodity prices and farm and land values the iowa economy has become consistently more diverse over the past several years in part due to both its low cost and ease of doing business the state is attractive for starting and expanding businesses due to enticing tax incentives meta platforms formerly facebook is in the process of expanding its data center estimated to be 41 million square feet when completed in 2023 during fall 2021 microsoft corporation began building one of two new data centers in west des moines additionally apple is set to begin construction of a 13 billion data center near des moines during 2022 iowa is the first state to produce more than 30 of its electricity with wind power enhancing its resilience and use of durable construction materials 

growth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a longhaul distribution network

the us department of the interior identified possible sources of indigenous rock and documents its limited supply in certain areas of the united states including the coastal areas from virginia to texas further certain interior united states markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning permitting andor environmental laws and regulations the company’s longhaul distribution network is used to supplement or in many cases wholly supply the local crushed stone needs of these areas 

the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of aggregates products this is particularly true where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location 

product shipments are moved by rail water and truck through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2021 the distribution network available to the company consisted of 84 aggregates yards and 16 cement terminals of which 11 cement terminals are classified as discontinued operations

the company’s increased rail shipments has made it more reliant on railroad performance issues including track congestion crew and availability the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts further changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the company’s rail network 

a portion of railcars and all ships of the company’s longhaul distribution network are under short and longterm leases some with purchase options and contracts of affreightment the limited availability of water and rail transportation providers coupled with limited distribution sites can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rates 

the company has longterm agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports these contracts of affreightment are takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements the minimum requirements were met in 2021 the company’s waterborne contracts of affreightment have

varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that such contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases 

the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and deepwater ships provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the southwest and southeast coastal markets 

public infrastructure historically the company’s largest enduse market is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs priorities of many of the government’s economic plans publicsector construction related to transportation infrastructure can be aggregates intensive and funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal highway bill currently the iij act provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are funded mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

since most states are required to balance their budgets reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states’ expenditures however the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources such as highway user fees or whether portions are paid for with general funds 

in addition to federal appropriations each state typically funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees over the past several years states have assumed a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes  management believes that financing at the state and local levels such as bond issuances toll roads vehicle miles traveled fees and tax initiatives will continue to grow and have a fundamental role in advancing infrastructure projects state infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company the level of state publicworks spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state the state economies of the building materials business’ ten largest revenuegenerating states may disproportionately affect the company’s financial performance 

governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than privatesector spending obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states before a state or local dot can solicit bids on an eligible construction project it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress

the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding a large number of roads highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 are now in need of major repair or reconstruction according to the road information program trip a national transportation research group vehicle travel on united states highways increased 26 from 2000 to 2019 while new lane road mileage increased only 9 over the same period trip also reports that 41 of the nation’s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition while 7 of the nation’s bridges are in poorstructurally deficient condition the 2021 trip report additionally stated an estimated backlog of 123 billion of improvements to the nation’s highway system exists and an increase of annual investment from 23 billion to 57 billion for the next 20 years is needed to address these improvements and meet mobility needs management believes infrastructure activity for 2022 and beyond should benefit from the iij act additional state and local infrastructure initiatives and the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act 

in addition to highways and bridges transportation infrastructure includes aviation mass transit and ports and waterways railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements

erratic weather can significantly impact operations 

production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather seasonal changes and other climaterelated conditions which can significantly affect the business typically due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity as such temperature plays a significant role in the months of march and november meaningfully affecting the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively where warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively 

excessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october though the hurricane season formally starts and ends on june 1 and november 1 respectively

goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment an interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment the impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 24 excluding goodwill allocated to assets held for sale of the company’s total assets at december 31 2021 the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions and an impairment charge could be material to the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company performs its impairment evaluation as of october 1 which represents the annual evaluation date

the company’s reporting units which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment are based on the operating segments of the building materials business the southwest division is the most significant reporting unit and includes 17 billion of the company’s goodwill there is no goodwill related to the magnesia specialties business 

certain of the aforementioned reporting units within the building materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting 

goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting units based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation if subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing

the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value which represents a step1 analysis however prior to step 1 the company may perform an optional qualitative assessment  or step 0  as part of the qualitative assessment the company considers among other things the following events and circumstances macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and other business or reporting unitspecific events if the company concludes it is morelikelythannot ie a likelihood of more than 50 that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value the company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit otherwise it proceeds to step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in step 1 when the company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further calculation is necessary a reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a step  1 failure and results in an impairment charge 

for the 2021 annual impairment evaluation the company performed a step0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is morelikelythannot that the reporting units’ fair values exceed their carrying values 

any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the company

pension benefit obligation and pension expense – selection of assumptions 

the company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a supplemental excess retirement plan serp for certain retirees see note k to the consolidated financial statements annually as of december 31 management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date reflecting expected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates a discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation 

annual pension expense referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements inclusive of serp expense consists of several components









these components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense 

management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions the key assumptions are as follows







 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 



management’s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations the company selected a hypothetical portfolio of moody’s aa bonds with maturities that match the benefit obligations to determine the discount rate at december 31 2021 the company selected a discount rate assumption of 323 a 7basispoint increase compared with the prioryear assumption of the four key assumptions the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate accordingly a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense and the projected benefit obligation 

management’s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases is generally based on the company’s historical increases in pensionable earnings while giving consideration to any future expectations a higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation the assumed longterm rate of increase is 45

management’s selection of the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a buildingblock approach whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses the company selected an expected return on assets of 675 the same as the prioryear rate the following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets



 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described

at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the society of actuaries’ pri2012 base mortality table the nocollar table was used for salaried participants and the bluecollar table was used for hourly participants both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the company’s participants the company selected the mp2020 scale for mortality improvement at december 31 2021 and 2020 

assumptions are selected on december 31 to calculate the succeeding year’s expense 

the assumptions selected at december 31 2021 were as follows



 

using these assumptions pension benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 was 114 billion and 2022 pension expense is expected to be approximately 107 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense 







the company made pension plan contributions of 828 million in 2021 and 4233 million during the fiveyear period ended december 31 2021 in total the company’s pension plans are overfunded fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation by 648 million at december 31 2021 the company’s projected benefit obligation was 114 billion at

december 31 20 2 1  a n in crease of  236 million  or 2 versus the prior year the company expects to make pension plan and serp contributions of  935 million in 202 2  of which  750 million are voluntary  

estimated effective income tax rate 

the company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes accordingly the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management’s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the result is management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate the etr 

income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the united states internal revenue code and the statutes of various foreign state and local tax jurisdictions in which the company conducts business changes in the statutory tax rates andor tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the etr the effect of these changes if material is recognized when the change is enacted 

as prescribed by these tax regulations as well as generally accepted accounting principles the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same therefore these differences between the company’s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent depending on their nature

temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period an example of a temporary difference is the use of the straightline method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities ie future tax deductions or future taxable income therefore when temporary differences occur they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account as such total income tax expense as reported in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences 

the company has deferred tax liabilities primarily for rightofuse assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangibles employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures the deferred tax liabilities attributable to property plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straightline and unitsofproduction methods used for financial reporting purposes these temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets the deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes this temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes either through divestitures or an impairment charge the timing of such events cannot be estimated the deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards the reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the company’s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes the temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture

the company has deferred tax assets primarily for inventories unvested stockbased compensation awards unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans lease liabilities valuation reserves net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards the deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes the reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stockbased compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes for financial reporting purposes the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period for income tax purposes no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture the company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period

business combinations – allocation of purchase price 

the company’s board of directors and management regularly review strategic longterm plans including potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesses which would increase the company’s market presence andor are related to the company’s existing markets when an acquisition is completed the company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date control is obtained the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition the company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions further the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are not amortized can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants considering the use of the asset that is physically possible legally permissible and financially feasible at the measurement date the company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options







level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded longterm debt

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables inventories machinery and equipment land buildings deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accruals for payables asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligations and contingencies additionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products and separatelyidentifiable intangible assets the fair values are determined using an excess earnings approach which requires significant judgment to estimate future cash flows net of capital investments in the specific operation and contributory asset charges the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain significant assumptions used to estimate future cash flows include changes in forecasted revenues based on sales price and shipment volumes as well as forecasted expenses inclusive of production costs and capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows

the company values separatelyidentifiable acquired intangible assets which may include but are not limited to permits customer relationships water rights and noncompetition agreements the fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or in the case of water rights a market approach 

the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings the selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the company subsequent to the business combination

the company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are based on the company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurementperiod adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction the measurement period ends once the company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings

property plant and equipment 

net property plant and equipment represented 44 excluding the amount allocated to assets held for sale of total assets at december 31 2021 accordingly accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors including production levels geographic location portability and maintenance practices additionally climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset historically the company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets

aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets the company evaluates aggregates reserves including those used in the cement manufacturing process in several ways depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite an acquisition or an existing operation greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section the depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site further the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable if the company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties for quality control calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves 

wellordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location this subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling the company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable locations underlain with hard rock deposits such as granite and limestone are drilled using the diamond core method which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use the number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the sitespecific geology some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults folds chemical irregularities clay pockets thickness of formations and weathering a typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous 

despite previous drilling and sampling once accessed the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary construction contracts for the infrastructure market in particular include specifications related to the aggregates material if a flaw in the deposit is discovered the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for nonspecification uses this can have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the company’s profitability in addition other issues can arise that limit the company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry including geological occurrences blasting practices and zoning issues

locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method whereby a sixinch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness additionally the quality and sandtogravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling 

the geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the company further the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit based on us geological maps also dictates the number of holes drilled

the generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows

proven reserves – these reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in us geologic maps the us department of agriculture soil maps aerial photographs andor electromagnetic seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms the proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps safety benches pillars underground and the fines small particles that will be generated during processing proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines the company typically assumes a loss factor of 25 however the assumed loss 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

factor at coastal operations is approximately 40 due to the nature of the material the assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35 primarily due to pillars 

probable reserves – these reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties 

the company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and also include reserves at the company’s inactive and undeveloped sites including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth the company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section

mineral reserves and mineral interests when acquired in connection with a business combination are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves

the company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its unitsofproduction calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests for 2021 depletion expense was 460 million

the company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements

new mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves when this occurs management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related preproduction development costs if the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves further a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred once a new mining area enters the production phase all postproduction stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs

further increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability if these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past construction spending could be reduced cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations 

the company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets this concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables however payment bonds normally posted on public projects together with lien rights on private projects mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables the level of demand in the company’s enduse markets production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the building materials business and therefore profitability production costs in the building materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices both directly and indirectly diesel fuel coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energyrelated input costs such as steel explosives tires and conveyor belts fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs primarily through fuel surcharges in the company’s longhaul distribution network the magnesia specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas

transportation in the company’s longhaul network particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains affects the company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets most notably texas colorado florida north carolina and the gulf coast in addition availability of railcars and locomotives affects the company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the company’s plant in manistee michigan and its customers the availability of trucks drivers and railcars to transport the company’s product particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand is also a risk and pressures the associated costs 

all of the company’s businesses are also subject to weatherrelated risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability the first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather hurricane activity in the atlantic ocean and gulf coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters 

risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the company’s control 

in addition to the foregoing other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements in this annual report include but are not limited to those listed above in item 1 “business – competition ” item 1a “risk factors” and “note a accounting policies” and “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

 item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as discussed earlier the company’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries consequently these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs see business environment section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k 

management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues further delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty

demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates during 2021 the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate and at december 31 2021 the rate was 007 the residential construction market accounted for approximately 25 of the company’s organic aggregates shipments in 2021 

aside from these inherent risks from within its operations the company’s earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates 

variablerate borrowing facilities

at december 31 2021 the company had an 8000 million revolving facility and a 4000 million trade receivable facility borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate as of december 31 2021 the company did not have any outstanding variablerate debt however any future borrowings under the credit facilities or outstanding variablerate debt are exposed to interest rate risk 

pension expense

the company’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and for the qualified defined benefit pension plan only the expected longterm rate of return on assets therefore the company has interest rate risk associated with these factors the impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the company’s annual pension expense is discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates – pension expense – selection of assumptions section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k

energy costs 

energy costs including diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and liquid asphalt represent significant production costs of the company the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products the cement product line and magnesia specialties business each have varying fixedprice agreements for a portion of their energy requirements a hypothetical 10 change in the company’s energy prices in 2022 as compared with 2021 assuming constant volumes would change 2022 energy expense by 333 million 

commodity risk

cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the company’s control increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand which can have a negative impact on product prices there can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations a hypothetical 10 change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by 494 million 

cement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products a hypothetical 10 change in cement costs in 2022 compared with 2021 assuming constant volumes would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by 315 million while increases in cement pricing may negatively impact the profitability of the ready mixed concrete operations the cement business would benefit although the positive impact may not reflect a direct correlation to the impact to the ready mix business

general

martin marietta materials inc the company or martin marietta is a natural resourcebased building materials company the company supplies aggregates crushed stone sand and gravel through its network of approximately 300 quarries mines and distribution yards in 27 states canada and the bahamas in 2020 the aggregates product gross profit accounted for 68 of the company’s consolidated total product gross profit in the western united states martin marietta also provides cement and downstream products namely ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving services in markets that are naturally vertically integrated and where the company has a leading aggregates position specifically the company has two cement plants in texas and ready mixed concrete and asphalt operations in texas colorado and wyoming asphalt operations and paving services are exclusively in colorado the company’s heavyside building materials are used in infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction projects aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast the aggregates cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are reported collectively as the “building materials business” the company also operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio the magnesia specialties business produces magnesiabased chemical products that are used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization magnesia specialties’ products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide 

for further information with respect to the development of the company’s business prior to 2020 see the information appearing under the heading “general” included in part i item 1 of the company’s form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which information is incorporated by reference 

business segment information

the company conducts its building materials business through two reportable segments organized by geography east group and west group the east group provides aggregates products only the west group provides aggregates cement and downstream products the top ten states accounted for 87 of the building materials business total revenues in 2020 texas colorado north carolina georgia iowa florida south carolina indiana maryland and nebraska the company’s magnesia specialties is reported as a separate segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses for more information on the organization and geographic area of the company’s business segments see “ note a accounting policiesorganization ” and “ note p segments ” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k this form 10k 

building materials business

the profitability of the building materials business which serves customers in the construction marketplace is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions including precipitation flooding hurricanes snowstorms extreme temperatures and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation 

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone sand and gravel which is manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the east group

cement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these plants produce portland and specialty cements have a combined 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

annual clinker capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 80 utilization in 20 20  the midlothian plant permit allows the company to expand production by up to 08 million additional tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates several cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily consisting of cement aggregates sand and water is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines such as dirt and clay the company operates 120 ready mix plants in texas colorado and wyoming asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt and paving operations are exclusively in colorado market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement 

the building materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with 36 of aggregates shipments in 2020 to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments primarily to contractors for nonresidential and residential construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments 

funding of public infrastructure the company’s largest enduse market is discussed in greater detail under “ building materials business’ key considerations—public infrastructure ” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ’’ of this form 10k 

the building materials business covers a wide geographic area the five largest revenuegenerating states texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa accounted for 71 of the building materials business’ total revenues by state of destination in 2020 the building materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time in 2020 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic impacted the global economy the company being considered an essential business continued to operate but experienced a modest volume decline in aggregates shipments due to a slowdown in overall construction activity however management believes this slowdown represents a delay rather than cancellations of projects 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule the distance covered by truck shipments from an individual quarry is limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a waterborne network where the permile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

the company’s distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via its longhaul rail and waterborne distribution network to markets where aggregates supply is limited the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s locations in the bahamas and nova scotia transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2020 the company’s distribution facilities consisted of 84 terminals the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of their aggregates products the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water associated internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margin this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability railcar availability locomotive availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including among other items meeting minimum tonnage 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

requirements of shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregates mines production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregates deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess marketplace transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the industry’s consolidation when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance pit development or other standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion or efficiency projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last several years as the economy recovered from the protracted recession opportunities include public and large private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balance sheets the company’s board of directors the board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s longterm strategic plans commonly referred to as soar strategic operating analysis and review which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets  

the company reports cement and downstream operations within the building materials business’ west group reportable segment their results are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to a greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves

management believes its aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in obtaining reserves used for production the company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years based on current production levels however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations  

the company generally sells its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of customer orders or requests the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

cement 

the cement operations of the building materials business produce portland and specialty cements similar to aggregates cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector  

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october approximately 70  75 of all cement shipments are sent to ready mixed concrete operators the rest are shipped to

manufacturers of concreterelated products contractors materials dealers and oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities 

energy accounted for approximately 21 of the cement production cost profile in 2020 therefore profitability of cement is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement operations is also subject to kiln maintenance which typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on companyowned property adjacent to each of the two cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

the cement operations generally deliver its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

magnesia specialties business

the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility and manufactures magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee michigan facility these magnesiabased chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2020 67 of magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products 32 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials

in 2020 79 of the lime produced in the magnesia specialties business was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 21 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 34 of the magnesia specialties’ total revenues in 2020 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization was negatively impacted by covid19 and averaged 65 in 2020 according to the federal reserve steel production in 2020 decreased 18 versus 2019 

in the magnesia specialties business a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for approximately 63 of its 2021 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs for 2020 the company’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas decreased 9 versus 2019 

given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing efficiency enhancements rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly these products are not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line however demand for chemicals products in 2020 was negatively impacted by covid19

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesiumrich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k

patents and trademarks 

as of january 31 2021 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and trademarks related to its business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole

customers

no material part of the business as a whole or of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof

competition

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its products due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build and maintain production facilities crushed stone production from quarries or mines and sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic cement producers are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some concrete markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large verticallyintegrated companies with facilities in many markets 

the company operates in a largelyfragmented industry with over 5000 domestic aggregates producers including large public companies and a large number of small privatelyheld companies other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following















due to the localized nature of the industry resulting from the high cost of transportation relative to the price of the product the building materials business primarily operates in smaller distinct areas that can vary from one another

capacity for cement plants is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity clinker is the initial product of cement production according to the us geological survey united states cement production is widely dispersed with the top five companies collectively producing approximately 61 of us clinker capacity an estimated 84 of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states the company’s cement operations also compete with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in texas

the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators large and small 

the company believes that its ability to transport materials by rail and waterborne vessels has enhanced its ability to compete in the building materials industry 

the magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products while the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2020 were predominantly domestic a portion was derived from customers located outside the united states

environmental and governmental regulations 

overview

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use mining air emissions including co 2 and other greenhouse gases water use allocation and discharges waste management noise and dust exposure control reclamation and other environmental health and safety and regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation

environmental compliance and accruals

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a fulltime team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 328 million in 2020 and 260 million in 2019 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 17 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately 15 million and 18 million in 2021 and 2022 respectively the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2020 and 2019 however the company’s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite the company’s compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the company’s businesses and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future

many of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may in the ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws moreover the company does not separate the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes as such an allocation would be arbitrary the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust ckd this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices since much of the ckd is unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and their attendant regulations are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts in addition new laws are also adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process typically takes years to finalize and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note o

mine safety and land reclamation

in general mining production and distribution facilities for aggregates cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality water quality and other environmental regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as the company locates and acquires new production and distribution facilities the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines production and distribution facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine production and distribution facilities can be situated with substantial distance from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations

as is the case with other similarly situated companies some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration msha and the occupational safety and health administration osha have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree interest rate the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “ note o commitments and contingencies ” of the “ notes to financial statements ” of the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k the company performs activities on an ongoing basis as an integral part of the normal quarrying process that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives  safety regulations required by msha for ongoing operations as well as final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are from time to time available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

greenhouse gases and climate change

amid concerns that greenhouse gas ghg emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reporting or reductions the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the united states the united states environmental protection agency usepa promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of ghgs report those emissions the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business release carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime magnesium oxide and hydroxide products the company’s two magnesiabased chemicals facilities as well as its two cement plants in texas file annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa reporting rule the primary operations of the company however including its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

emissions in fact most of the ghg emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment 

in 2010 the usepa also issued a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v operating permit programs the us supreme court ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the best available control technology bact requirements for ghgs emitted by sources already subject to psd or title v permitting requirements for other pollutants both of the company’s cement plants as well as its magnesia specialties plants hold title v permits and each other than the manistee michigan facility is also subject to psd requirements with the change of the us presidential administration it is too early to determine whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of the tailoring rule or proceed otherwise it is also unknown how the usepa may revise bact requirements in fact although several largescale projects for carbon capture are in the development phase no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency thus if future modifications to our facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg bact requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs however it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements

us president biden has made climate change a central focus of his administration in addition to reentering the paris agreement on january 27 2021 president biden issued a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making the climate change central to us policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal governmental will take to implement the orders or the full scope timing or ramifications of such measures it is clear that the administration intends to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and like other signatories to the paris agreement intends to pursue a goal of a net zero ghg by 2050 the orders combined with democratic control of both chambers of the 117 th us congress suggest that additional executive andor legislative action is likely although the timing and scope of such action is unclear it also seems probable that the usepa and other agencies will likely use their rulemaking authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change various states where the company has operations are considering climate change initiatives as well and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed

if and when the usepa issues new regulations andor congress passes additional legislation on ghgs the woodville ohio and manistee michigan magnesia specialties operations as well as the company’s two cement plants in texas which release co 2 in certain of their processes and use carbonbased fuels for power equipment kilns and the company’s mobile fleet will likely be subject to any new requirements the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement operations facilities would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation however compete against other products that due to the form andor structure of the source material require less energy in the calcination process resulting in the generation of fewer ghgs per ton of production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market in addition the cement produced by the company’s two plants in texas like other us operators is subject to strict limits set by the us department of transportation dot and other agencies including those relating to “clinker substitution” or the replacement of ground clinker in cement with alternate materials such as pozzolan slag and fly ash which has implications for the company’s fuel use and efforts to reduce ghg emissions from its operations for example various industry associations are engaged in an effort to ask the us dot and other agencies to revise their standards allowing for greater rates of clinker substitution similar to the rates currently permitted for european cement producers if higher rates of substitution and blending are in fact permitted in the future the result is likely to be both reduced clinker and power consumption in cement production which would in turn reduce ghgs emitted in connection with each ton of cement produced in the us

in light of the various regulatory uncertainties the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be nonetheless the company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties business or building materials business the company continues to monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on the company’s cement business financial condition and product demand

in addition to impacts from increased regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and t he bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states notably the carolinas florida and georgia where it impacted the company’s facilities 

the company’s businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels the company could incur increased costs or disruptions in its operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of electricity or fuels or other materials used in its operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact the company’s customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks

notwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change there may also be opportunities for the company to increase its business or revenues for example warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively which could have meaningful positive impacts on the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively in addition the company’s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries including both coal and gasfired electricity generation which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and ghg emissions by more ghgintense companies finally the desire for sustainable building solutions has led to greater recognition of the benefits of concrete construction in the effort to move to a circular economy thorough innovative products longevity and recyclability and increased demand for green construction projects would have a direct impact on the company’s cement and concrete business

in an effort to mitigate the risks to the company associated with ghg emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability the company has adopted a corporatewide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate ghg reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies including using alternative fuels such as biodiesel reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems rightsizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips replacing older railcars with more efficient highcapacity models that reduce the number of required trips adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements and installing emissions monitoring equipment and realtime fleet management software for example in 2015 the company’s midlothian cement plant was recognized by the usepa as a high performing energy efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels 

land management

the company owns approximately 140000 acres of land the vast majority of which is used in connection with active facilities the company regularly reviews its land holdings to determine their highest and best use based on its management expertise and sell or develop for sale surplus property land holdings that do not have economically recoverable reserves for current or future mining or are otherwise not in locations that complement the company’s operating facilities are considered as candidates for sale 

human capital resources 

as of january 31 2021 the company has approximately 8700 employees of which approximately 6600 are hourly employees and approximately 2100 are salaried employees included among these employees are nearly 900 hourly employees represented by labor unions 103 of the company’s employees of such amount 97  of the building materials business’ hourly employees are members of a labor union and 100  of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts for the magnesia specialties business cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the woodville and manistee collective bargaining agreements expire june 2022 and august 2023 respectively the company believes it has good relations with its employees including its unionized employees while the company’s management does not expect material difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations 

management believes the company’s success depends on its ability to attract develop and retain key personnel none of martin marietta’s accomplishments and nothing it has achieved would be possible without its employees the people who both drive the work and are most affected by it these individuals are the heart of martin marietta the company’s management oversees various employee initiatives to foster and improve its employees and the management development and compensation committee regularly reviews the compensation program to achieve those objectives

industry and covid19 risk factors

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects as a result of these issues several of our top revenuegenerating states from timetotime stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments

we sell most of our aggregates our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry therefore our results depend on that industry’s strength since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s the great recession was an example and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their selling price if economic conditions

and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in the building materials business’ top five revenue generating states of texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa  our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation during the great recession 

the great recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry subsequent to the great recession and until the impact from covid19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced slowbutsteady construction growth that coincided with the longest economic recovery in united states history 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation fast act 

our building materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather which can significantly impact operations

since the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production production and shipment levels of the building materials business’ products follow activity in the construction industry which typically are strongest in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s building materials business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather and thus are generally the least profitable the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october 

our businesses could be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic or any other outbreak of disease epidemic or pandemic or similar public health threat or fear of such an event and its related economic and societal response

our businesses could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions in or around december 2019 covid19 was initially reported four months later in march 2020 the world health organization declared it a global pandemic the proliferation of covid19 cases in the united states and the extent that geography of outbreaks primarily matches the regions in which the company’s building materials business principally operates in combination with the related governmental orders limiting individuals’ movements and social gatherings as well as requiring many businesses to close for an undetermined period of time are negatively impacting economic activity consumer confidence and discretionary spending and overall market conditions further covid19 could continue to negatively affect the health of our employees employee productivity customer purchasing patterns and fulfillment of purchase orders availability of supplies pricing for raw materials and the ability to transport materials via the company’s distribution network while our operations have been designated as “essential” under applicable government orders otherwise restricting business activities to prevent further outbreak of covid19 and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate during the pendency of these orders it is possible that they may not continue to be so treated under future government orders or even if so treated sitespecific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of the company’s operations to be halted for some period of time we are monitoring the impact of covid19 on our operations and on our product demand due to economic uncertainty related to covid19 contractors and customers may delay advancing or ultimately cancel building projects in addition reduced travel due to remote working and stayathome practices including as a result of governmental orders restricting activity may continue to negatively impact fuel tax revenues that fund highway projects while we do not currently expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity we are unable to accurately and fully predict the impact that covid19 will have on the results of operations due to various uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and

competition and growth risk factors

our building materials business depends on the availability of quality aggregates reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically

our challenge is to find quality aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve applicable markets as communities have grown they have settled in and around attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods including rail and water while our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical we can give no assurances that we will be successful at this strategy

our businesses face many competitors

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement operations may compete with international competitors who are importing products into the united states from jurisdictions with lower production and regulatory costs

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and we may acquire businesses by paying all or in part with shares of our common stock

we expect to continue to grow in part by acquiring other businesses in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing longterm shareholder return

our integration of the acquisition or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations however in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to undertake may require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations based on our history we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 















our acquisitions could harm our results of operations

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that















our cement and magnesia specialties businesses may become capacityconstrained

if our cement or magnesia specialties businesses becomes capacityconstrained we may be unable to timely satisfy the demand for some of our products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity further particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacityconstrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize while we are permitted to expand production by up to 08 million additional tons at our midlothian cement plant it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition 

our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws

in the past the cement industry has obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement product line 

economic political and legal risk factors

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment health and safety and other areas of the law as well as litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including carbon dioxide and other ghgs water use allocation and discharges waste management noise and dust control mining reclamation and other environmental health and safety matters govern our operations some of our operations require permits which may impose additional operating standards and are subject to modification renewal and revocation certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations the risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses these potential liabilities could result in material costs including for fines or personal injury or damages claims which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 

future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs we could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials explosives products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition  an unexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our company 

climate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business including potential physical and financial impacts

amid concerns that ghg emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the us the usepa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering ghg emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the usepa has also promulgated a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the tailoring rule which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act although the us supreme court subsequently ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the bact requirements for ghgs emitted by sources that already require title v operating permits or are subject to psd requirements for other pollutants with the change of the us presidential administration it is too early to tell whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of the tailoring rule or proceed in a different direction nor is it known how the usepa may revise the bact requirements if future modifications to our magnesia specialties or cement facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg permitting requirements may also be triggered which could require us to incur significant additional costs it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any future requirements at this time

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

us president biden has made climate change a central focus of his administration in addition to reentering the paris agreement on january 27 2021 president biden issued a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making the climate change central to u  s  policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal governmental will take to implement the orders or the full scope timing or ramifications of such measures it is clear that the administration intends to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and like other signatories to the paris agreement intends to pursue a goal of a net zero ghg by 2050 the orders combined with democratic control of both chambers of the us congress suggest that additional executive andor legislative action is likely although the timing and scope of such action is unclear additionally i t seems probable that the usepa and other agencies will likely use their rulemaking authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change various states where we have operations are considering climate change initiatives as well  and we may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed in light of the various regulatory uncertainties we cannot at this time reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be but we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties business or building materials b usiness we continue to monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business financial condition and product demand 

although our aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are not major sources of ghg emissions any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact our magnesiabased chemicals operations in woodville ohio and manistee michigan as well as our two cement plants in texas each of which file annual reports of ghg emissions as required by the usepa reporting rule however it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time in addition we may not be able to recover any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at those plants from our customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets

in addition to impacts from increased ghg and other climaterelated regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on our operations or financial condition given the nature of our operations physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by our operations in particular our operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact our customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for our products we may not be able to pass on to our customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks

the overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources

our products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the current federal highway bill the fast act which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs the fast act was extended for one year and now is set to expire september 30 2021 if a reauthorization bill is not finalized prior to the fast act expiration the company anticipates some level of funding would be continued with continuing resolutions uncertainty of federal funding has led to an increase in state and alternative methods of infrastructure funding we expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state and local levels in 2021 aided by 10 billion for state departments of transportation provided by the december 2020 federal stimulus package as well as 14 billion of approved ballot initiatives at the federal level we expect to see stable infrastructure 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

spending in 202 1 resulting from the fast act extension  but beyond that will be dependent on a successor bill to the fast act or continuing resolutions in the future for any greater federal impact on funding any enhanced federal infrastructure bill will require congressional approval we cannot be assured however of such approval or of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates

our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore our business in these industries may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

notably demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregates products is affected by interest rates which are currently at historically low levels there can be no assurance however that interest rates will not increase in the future affecting our business in an adverse manner the residential construction market accounted for 24 of our aggregates shipments in 2020 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below

increases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including





















any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

personnel risks

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses

labor unions represent approximately 10 of the hourly employees of our building materials business and all of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2022 and august 2023 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of and on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel and executive officers including qualified management technical marketing and sales and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

financial accounting and cost management risk factors

our business is a capitalintensive business

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read the critical accounting policies and estimates section included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the form 10k 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are periodically changed new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s pcaob inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits our costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to our business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market have been negatively affected by federal and state budget challenges and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers as well as state lien rights nevertheless we may experience a delay in payment from some of our customers during a construction downturn which would negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate

the credit environment could impact our ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt it is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue new equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investmentgrade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on any variablerate debt including the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels also while we believe the company will continue to have adequate credit available to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas activities

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products outside the united states therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of planned maintenance failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2020 the cement operations incurred shutdown costs of 197 million during the year in 2020 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 51 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time

our paving operations present additional risks to our business

our paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixedprice contracts we guarantee project completion by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our paving operations we also have fixedprice and fixedunitprice contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contracts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are projects that are short in duration 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement operations due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore if we expand these operations our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 109 for 2020 and 104 for 2019

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

suppliers raw materials and energy costs risk factors

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have historically been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy changes in energy costs also affect the prices that we pay for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we may enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk

our magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for 63 of its 2021 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs the cement operations have fixedprice agreements for a portion of their 2021 coal and natural gas needs

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 21 of the 2020 direct production costs of our cement operations therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement operations 

similarly our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials 

cement is sensitive to supply and price volatility

cement competition is often based primarily on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally decline we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

cyber and information security risk factors

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure including reliance on thirdparty vendors and thirdparty software any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the

security of our information systems network we cannot ensure that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

other risk factors

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or water we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs

the availability of railcars can also affect our ability to transport our products railcars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease railcars for use in other industries we may not have enough railcars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

some of our products are distributed by barges along rivers in ohio and west virginia we may experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following

as of december 31 2020 the company processed or shipped aggregates from approximately 300 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 27 states canada and the bahamas of which 130 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 61 are on land owned in part and leased in part 91 are on leased land and 14 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on average represent approximately 90 years at current production levels however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2020 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete and asphalt products from 128 properties in three states of which 100 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances two are on land owned in part and leased in part two are at facilities neither owned nor leased and 24 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregates to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to exclude calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement operations as it does for its aggregates operations for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates  property plant and equipment ” included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k

the company operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio the magnesia specialties business produces magnesiabased chemicals products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization magnesia specialties’ products are shipped to customers worldwide 

consolidated strategic objectives

the company’s strategic planning process or s trategic o perating a nalysis and r eview soar provides the framework for execution of martin marietta’s longterm strategic plan guided by this framework and considering the cyclicality of the building materials business the company determines capital allocation priorities to maximize longterm shareholder value creation the company’s strategy includes ongoing evaluation of aggregatesled opportunities of scale in new domestic markets ie platform acquisitions expansion through acquisitions that complement existing operations ie bolton acquisitions and divestitures of assets that are not consistent with stated strategic goals the company finances such opportunities with the goal of preserving its financial flexibility by having a leverage ratio consolidated debttoconsolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda within a range of 20 times to 25 times within a reasonable time following the completion of a debtfinanced transaction

the company by purposeful design will continue to be an aggregatesled business aggregates product gross profit represented 68 of 2020 total consolidated gross profit that focuses on markets with strong underlying growth fundamentals where it can sustain or achieve a leading market position driven by this intentional approach the company has leading positions defined as either 1 or 2 in approximately 90 of its markets as part of its longterm strategic plan the company may also pursue strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities for martin marietta strategic cement and targeted downstream operations are located in verticallyintegrated markets where the company has or envisions a clear path toward a leading aggregates position 

generally the company’s building materials products are both sourced and sold locally as a result geography is critically important when assessing market attractiveness and growth opportunities attractive geographies exhibit a population growth andor population density both of which are drivers of heavyside building materials consumption b business and employment diversity drivers of greater economic stability and c a superior state financial position a driver of public infrastructure growth and support

in order to assess population growth and density the company focuses on the megaregions of the united states megaregions are large networks of metropolitan population centers covering thousands of square miles according to america 2050  a planning and policy program of the regional plan association a majority of the nation’s population and economic growth through 2050 will occur in 11 megaregions the company has a presence in most of the megaregions as evidence of the successful execution of soar the company’s leading positions in the texas triangle and colorado’s front range megaregions its growth platform in the southern portion of the northeast megaregion and its enhanced position in the piedmont atlantic megaregion primarily in the atlanta area are the results of acquisitions since 2011 the company has a legacy presence in the southeastern portion of the great lakes megaregion encompassing operations in indiana and ohio the megaregions and the company’s key states are more fully discussed in the building materials business’ key considerations section

business environment 

building materials business 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics 

the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore erratic weather patterns precipitation and other weatherrelated conditions including flooding hurricanes snowstorms cold temperatures and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

winter weather while the second and third quarters can be subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation the impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the building materials business’ key considerations section 

product lines

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone and sand and gravel manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is also the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the east group the company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years at the 2020 annual production level 

cement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in the state of texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these two facilities produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual capacity of approximately 45 million tons and collectively operated at approximately 80 utilization in 2020 the midlothian plant has a permit that allows for annual capacity expansion of 08 million tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates several cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily of cement sand aggregates and water is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete are a washed material with limited amounts of fines ie dirt and clay the company operates 120 ready mix plants in texas colorado and wyoming asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt operations and paving services are located in colorado market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with the company’s upstream product lines of aggregates and cement 

enduse trends





♦ total value of construction put in place increased 5 

♦ public construction spending increased 5 

♦ private nonresidential construction market spending decreased 3 

♦ private residential construction market spending increased 12 

the principal enduse markets of the building materials business are public infrastructure ie highways streets roads bridges and schools nonresidential construction ie manufacturing and distribution facilities industrial complexes office buildings large retailers and wholesalers healthcare hospitality and energyrelated activity and residential construction ie subdivision development and single and multifamily housing aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast collectively comprising the chemrockrail market 

public infrastructure projects can require several years to complete while residential and nonresidential construction projects are usually completed within one year generally customer purchase orders do not contain firm quantity commitments regardless of enduse market therefore management does not utilize a company backlog in managing its business  

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the public infrastructure market accounted for 3 6  of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2020  a nticipated lower shipments in portions of north carolina  reduced energysector activity and covid19driven project delays were primary factors for the 1  shipment decline to this end use  the company’s shipments to this enduse market remain below the most recent fiveyear average of 3 8  and tenyear average of 4 3  

while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles  the historic level of spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable due to the predictability of funding from federal state and local governments with approximately half of the funding from federal government and half from state and local governments the fixing america’s surface transportation act fast act signed into law on december 4 2015 authorized 305 billion over fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and was subsequently extended for one year providing an additional 136 billion to the highway trust fund 

public construction projects once awarded are typically seen through to completion thus delays from weather or other factors can serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding in november 2020 303 state and local ballot initiatives or 94 of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote were approved that set a 20year approval rating record the approved infrastructure initiatives are estimated to generate nearly 14 billion in onetime and recurring revenues with initiatives in texas accounting for over 11 billion of this total 

the nonresidential construction market accounted for 34 of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2020 following strong activity in 2019 aggregates shipments to this end use decreased 9 reflecting reduced energysector activity from low oil prices and the completion of certain windfarm and a pause in some liquefied natural gas projects the dodge momentum index a twelvemonth leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgrawhill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 was 1346 in december 2020 while down 5 compared with december 2019 the index increased 9 from november 2020 to december 2020 suggesting positive momentum in the nonresidential construction sector at the onset of 2021

 

the residential construction market accounted for 24 of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2020 and increased 6 compared with 2019 this end use is interest rate sensitive and typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles the company’s exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions including roads sidewalks utilities and storm and sewage drainage aggregates used in new singlefamily home construction and aggregates used in construction of multifamily units construction of both subdivisions and singlefamily homes is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than construction of multifamily units through an economic cycle multifamily construction generally begins early in the cycle and then transitions to singlefamily construction therefore the timing of new subdivision starts as well as new singlefamily housing permits are strong indicators of residential volumes residential housing starts of 14 million units for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 7 compared with 2019 but remain below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units for the year ended december 31 2020 national housing permits increased 5 versus 2019 the company expects continued growth in the residential market driven by undersupply low interest rates favorable demographics job growth deurbanization land availability and efficient permitting

the remaining 6  of the company’s 2020 aggregates shipments was to the chemrockrail market which includes ballast and agricultural limestone ballast is an aggregates product used to stabilize railroad track beds and increasingly concrete rail ties are being used as a substitute for wooden ties agricultural lime a highcalcium carbonate material is used as a supplement in animal feed a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer additionally chemrockrail includes rip rap which is used as a stabilizing material to control erosion caused by water runoff at embankments ocean beaches inlets rivers and streams and highcalcium limestone which is used as filler in glass plastic paint rubber adhesives grease and paper chemicalgrade highcalcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants 

pricing trends 

materials pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreedupon price during a definitive period since infrastructure projects span multiple years announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the company sells products under existing price agreements pricing escalators included in multiyear infrastructure contracts serve to somewhat mitigate this effect however during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs multiyear infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth additionally the company may implement midyear price increases on a marketbymarket basis where appropriate pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market 

 

on a mixadjusted basis which is discussed further in the results of operations section 2020 aggregates pricing improved by 40 and 2020 cement pricing increased 32 

cost structure 

direct production costs for the building materials business are components of cost of revenues incurred at the quarries mines cement plants ready mixed concrete plants asphalt plants and paving operations and distribution yards and facilities cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility and production overhead costs 

generally the significant components of direct production costs for the building materials business are 1 labor and related benefits 2 raw materials 3 depreciation depletion and amortization dda 4 repairs and maintenance 5 contract

services  6 supplies  and 7 energy  in 2020  these categories represented 9 0  of the building materials business’ total direct production costs 

production is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours further components of energy supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume accordingly the company’s operating leverage can be substantial 

generally when the company invests capital in facilities and equipment increased capacity and productivity along with reduced labor and repair costs can offset increased fixed depreciation costs however the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lowerdemand environment resulting in under absorption of fixed costs

wage and benefit inflation and increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy further workforce reductions resulting from process automation and mobile fleet rightsizing primarily in the aggregates operations have mitigated rising labor costs during economic downturns the company reviews its operations and where practical temporarily idles certain sites the company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close proximity in certain markets management can create production “super crews” that work on a rotating basis at various locations within a district for example within a market a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry this has allowed the company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand 

the production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt requires the use of cement and liquid asphalt raw materials respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results 

cement production is a capitalintensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate continuously with the exception of maintenance shutdowns kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2020 and 2019 the cement operations incurred outage costs of 197 million and 263 million respectively the decrease in outage costs in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily attributable to improved kiln reliability resulting from priorperiod investments and the timing of planned kiln outages the company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns 

typically diesel fuel represents the single largest component of energy costs for the building materials business the average cost per gallon was 149 and 208 in 2020 and 2019 respectively changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires further the company’s contracts of affreightment for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range 

the impact of inflation on the company’s businesses has not been significant further historically the company has achieved pricing growth in periods of inflation based on its ability to increase its selling prices in a normal economic environment

growth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a longhaul distribution network

the us department of the interior’s geological map of the united states depicts the possible sources of indigenous rock and illustrates its limited supply in certain areas of the united states including the coastal areas from virginia to texas further certain interior united states markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning permitting andor environmental laws and regulations the company’s longhaul distribution network is used to supplement or in many cases wholly supply the local crushed stone needs of these areas 

the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of aggregates products this is particularly true where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location

product shipments are moved by rail water and truck through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2020  the distribution network available to the company consisted of 84 terminals 

the company’s increased rail shipments has made it more reliant on railroad performance issues including track congestion crew and availability the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts further changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the company’s rail network 

a portion of railcars and all ships of the company’s longhaul distribution network are under short and longterm leases some with purchase options and contracts of affreightment the limited availability of water and rail transportation providers coupled with limited distribution sites can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rates 

the company has longterm agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports these contracts of affreightment are takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements the minimum requirements were met in 2020 the company’s waterborne contracts of affreightment have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that such contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases 

the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and deepwater ships provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the southwest and southeast coastal markets 

public infrastructure the company’s largest enduse market is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs priorities of many of the government’s economic plans publicsector construction related to transportation infrastructure can be aggregates intensive and is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal highway bill currently the fast act provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are funded mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

since most states are required to balance their budgets reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states’ expenditures however the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources such as highway user fees or whether portions are paid for with general funds 

in addition to federal appropriations each state funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees over the past several years states have assumed a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes  management believes that financing at the state and local levels such as bond issuances toll roads and tax initiatives will continue to grow and have a fundamental role in advancing infrastructure projects state infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company the level of state publicworks spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state the state economies of the building materials business’ ten largest revenuegenerating states may disproportionately affect the company’s financial performance

governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than privatesector spending obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states before a state or local dot can solicit bids on an eligible construction project it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress

the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding a large number of roads highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 are now in need of major repair or reconstruction according to the road information program trip a national transportation research group vehicle travel on united states highways increased 25  from 2000 to 201 8  while new lane road mileage increased only 9  over the same period trip also reports that pavement on 11  of the nation’s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 27  of the nation’s interstate bridges are in need of repair or replacement with 3 of bridges rated poor or structurally deficient  the 2020 trip report additionally state d an estimated backlog of 123 billion of improvements to the nation’s highway system exists and an increase of annual investment from 23 billion to 57 billion for the next 20 years is needed to address these improvements and meet mobility needs management believes infrastructure activity for 202 1 and beyond should benefit from the fast act extension and its eventual successor bill  additional state and local infrastructure initiatives and the 2017 tax act 

in addition to highways and bridges transportation infrastructure includes aviation mass transit and ports and waterways railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements 

erratic weather can significantly impact operations

production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather seasonal changes and other climaterelated conditions which can significantly affect the business typically due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity as such temperature plays a significant role in the months of march and november meaningfully affecting the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively where warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively 

excessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october though the hurricane season formally starts and ends on june 1 and november 1 respectively the 2020 atlantic hurricane season set a record with 30 named storms of which 13 were hurricanes to put this in perspective the average hurricane season has 12 named storms of which six are hurricanes the gulf coast eastern seaboard the bahamas and nova scotia were all impacted by storms in 2020 

capital investment decisions driven by capital intensity of the building materials business and focus on land

the company’s organic capital program is designed to leverage construction market growth through investment in both permanent and portable facilities at the company’s operations over an economic cycle the company typically invests organic capital at an annual level that approximates depreciation expense at midcycle and through cyclical peaks organic capital investment typically exceeds depreciation expense as the company supports current capacity needs and future growth conversely at a cyclical trough the company may reduce levels of capital investment regardless of cycle the company sets a priority of investing capital to ensure safe environmentallysound and efficient operations as well as to provide the highest quality of customer service and establish a foundation for future growth

the company is diligent in its focus on land opportunities including potential new sites greensites and expanding locations land purchases are usually opportunistic and can include contiguous property around existing quarry locations such property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry typically allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and an extension of quarry life

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business manufactures magnesiabased chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee michigan facility the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility of 2020 total revenues 67 were attributable to chemicals products 32 were attributable to lime and 1 was attributable to stone 

in 2020 79 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 21 was used internally as a raw material for the business’ manufacturing of chemicals products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are primarily used by the steel industry and overall 34 of magnesia specialties’ 2020 total revenues related to products used in the steel industry accordingly a portion of the segment’s revenues and profits is affected by production and inventory trends within the steel industry which are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors steel production was adversely affected by covid19 notably when domestic auto manufacturers shutdown due to the pandemic steel capacity utilization decreased dramatically from a high of nearly 81 in january 2020 to just below 50 in april 2020 steel capacity utilization as of december 2020 was 74 the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 65 in 2020 the chemical products business focuses on highermargin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volumes that support efficient operations 

total revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2020 were predominantly derived from domestic customers and no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the total revenues for the business financial results can be affected by foreign currency exchange rates increasing transportation costs or weak economic conditions in foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effect of currency exchange rates foreign transactions are denominated in united states dollars 

a significant portion of the magnesia specialties business’ costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the company has fixed price agreements for approximately 63 of its 2021 energy needs for coal natural gas petroleum coke and electricity for 2020 the segment’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet of natural gas decreased 9 versus 2019 given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results of operations management expects future organic profitability growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the risks mentioned in the longhaul distribution discussion in the building materials business’ key considerations section

environmental regulation and litigation 

the expansion and growth of the aggregates industry is subject to increasing challenges from environmental and political advocates aiming to control the pace and direction of future development certain environmental groups have published lists of targeted municipal areas including areas within the company’s marketplace for environmental and suburban growth control the effect of these initiatives on the company’s growth is typically localized further challenges are expected as the momentum of these initiatives ebb and flow across the united states rail and other transportation alternatives are being heralded by these specialinterest groups as solutions to mitigate road traffic congestion and overcrowding 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may occasionally use substances classified as toxic or hazardous the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation new permits are generally required for opening new sites or for expansion at existing operations and can take several years to obtain in the area of land use rezoning and special or conditional use permits are increasingly difficult to obtain once a permit is issued the location is required to generally operate in accordance with the approved site plan 

the clean air act originally passed in 1963 and periodically updated by amendments is the united states’ national air pollution control program that granted the environmental protection agency epa authority to set limits on the level of various air pollutants to be in compliance with national ambient air quality standards a defined geographic area must be below established limits for six pollutants environmental groups have been successful in lawsuits against the federal and certain state departments of transportation delaying highway construction in municipal areas not in compliance with the clean air act the epa designates geographic areas as nonattainment areas when the level of air pollutants exceeds the national standard nonattainment areas receive deadlines to reduce air pollutants by instituting various control strategies or otherwise face fines or control by the epa included as nonattainment areas are several major metropolitan areas in the company’s markets such as houstonbrazoriagalveston texas dallasfort worth texas bexar county in san antonionew braunfels texas denver colorado boulder colorado fort collinsgreeleyloveland colorado atlanta georgia and baltimore maryland federal transportation funding has been directly tied to compliance with the clean air act

income tax expense 

variances in the estimated effective income tax rates when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves the effect of state income taxes stock compensation deductions and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized additionally certain acquisitionrelated expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes

the permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate the statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations due to these limitations changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate however the impact of the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings

other financial information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates require management’s subjective and complex judgments amounts reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates resulting in actual results differing from those estimates methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates as well as the related disclosures have been reviewed by and discussed with the company’s audit committee management’s determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict 

impairment review of goodwill 

goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment an interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment the impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 23 of the company’s total assets at december 31 2020 the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions and an impairment charge could be material to the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company performs its impairment evaluation as of october 1 which represents the annual evaluation date

the company’s reporting units which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment are based on the operating segments of the building materials business the southwest division is the most significant reporting unit and includes 17 billion of the company’s goodwill there is no goodwill related to the magnesia specialties business 

certain of the aforementioned reporting units within the building materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting 

goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting units based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation if subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value which represents a step1 analysis however prior to step 1 the company may perform an optional qualitative assessment or step 0 as part of the qualitative assessment the company considers among other things the following events and circumstances macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and other business or reporting unitspecific events if the company concludes it is 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

morelikelythannot ie a likelihood of more than 50 that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value the company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit otherwise it proceeds to step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in step 1 when the company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further calculation is necessary a reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a step  1 failure and results in an impairment charge 

for the 2020 annual impairment evaluation the company performed a step0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is morelikelythannot that the reporting units’ fair values exceed their carrying values 

any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the company

pension benefit obligation and pension expense – selection of assumptions 

the company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a supplemental excess retirement plan serp for certain retirees see note k to the consolidated financial statements annually as of december 31 management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date reflecting expected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates a discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation 

annual pension expense referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements inclusive of serp expense consists of several components









these components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense 

management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions the key assumptions are as follows









management’s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations the company selected a hypothetical portfolio of moody’s aa bonds with maturities that match the benefit 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

obligations to determine the discount rate at december 31 20 20  the company selected a discount rate assumption of 3 1 6  a 53 basispoint de crease compared with the prioryear assumption of the four key assumptions the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate accordingly a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense and the projected benefit obligation  

management’s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases is generally based on the company’s historical increases in pensionable earnings while giving consideration to any future expectations a higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation the assumed longterm rate of increase is 45

management’s selection of the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a buildingblock approach whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses the company selected an expected return on assets of 675 the same as the prioryear rate the following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets



 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the society of actuaries’ pri2012 base mortality table the nocollar table was used for salaried participants and the bluecollar table was used for hourly participants both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the company’s participants the company selected the mp2020 and the mp2018 scales for mortality improvement at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

assumptions are selected on december 31 to calculate the succeeding year’s expense for the 2020 pension expense assumptions selected at december 31 2019 were as follows



 

using these assumptions the pension benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 was 9778 million and 2020 pension expense was 368 million a change in the assumptions would have had the following impact on the december 31 2019 pension benefit obligation and the 2020 expense 







 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 

the assumptions selected at december 31 2020 were as follows



 

using these assumptions pension benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 was 111 billion and 2021 pension expense is expected to be approximately 259 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense 







the company made pension plan contributions of 884 million in 2020 and 3853 million during the fiveyear period ended december 31 2020 despite these contributions the company’s pension plans are underfunded projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets by 740 million at december 31 2020 the company’s projected benefit obligation was 111 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 1341 million versus the prior year driven by the lower discount rate the company expects to make pension plan and serp contributions of 826 million in 2021 of which 750 million are voluntary

estimated effective income tax rate 

the company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes accordingly the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management’s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the result is management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate the etr 

income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the united states internal revenue code and the statutes of various foreign state and local tax jurisdictions in which the company conducts business changes in the statutory tax rates andor tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the etr the effect of these changes if material is recognized when the change is enacted 

as prescribed by these tax regulations as well as generally accepted accounting principles the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same therefore these differences between the company’s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent depending on their nature

temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period an example of a temporary difference is the use of the straightline method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities ie future tax deductions or future taxable income therefore when temporary differences occur they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account as such total income tax expense as reported in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences 

the company has deferred tax liabilities primarily for rightofuse assets property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangibles employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures the deferred tax liabilities attributable to property plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straightline and unitsofproduction methods used for financial reporting purposes these temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets the deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes this temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes either through divestitures or an impairment 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

charge the timing of such events cannot be estimated the deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards the reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the company’s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes the temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture 

the company has deferred tax assets primarily for inventories unvested stockbased compensation awards unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans lease liabilities valuation reserves net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards the deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes the reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stockbased compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes for financial reporting purposes the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period for income tax purposes no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture the company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period 

business combinations – allocation of purchase price 

the company’s board of directors and management regularly review strategic longterm plans including potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesses which would increase the company’s market presence andor are related to the company’s existing markets when an acquisition is completed the company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date control is obtained the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition the company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions further the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are not amortized can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants considering the use of the asset that is physically possible legally permissible and financially feasible at the measurement date the company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options

specific operation and contributory asset charges the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include changes in sales price shipment volumes and production costs as well as capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows 

the company values separatelyidentifiable acquired intangible assets which may include but are not limited to permits customer relationships water rights and noncompetition agreements the fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or in the case of water rights a market approach 

the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings the selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the company subsequent to the business combination

the company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are based on the company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurementperiod adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction the measurement period ends once the company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings

property plant and equipment 

net property plant and equipment represented 50 of total assets at december 31 2020 accordingly accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors including production levels geographic location portability and maintenance practices additionally climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset historically the company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets

aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets the company evaluates aggregates reserves including those used in the cement manufacturing process in several ways depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite an acquisition or an existing operation greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section the depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site further the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable if the company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties for quality control calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves 

wellordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location this subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling the company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable locations underlain with hard rock deposits such as granite and limestone are drilled using the diamond core method which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use the number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the sitespecific geology some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults folds chemical irregularities clay pockets thickness of formations and weathering a typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous 

despite previous drilling and sampling once accessed the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary construction contracts for the infrastructure market in particular include specifications related to the aggregates material if a flaw in the deposit is discovered the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications although it is possible that the 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

aggregates material can still be used for nonspecification uses this can have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the company’s profitability in addition other issues can arise that limit the company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry including geological occurrences blasting practices and zoning issues 

locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method whereby a sixinch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness additionally the quality and sandtogravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling 

the geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the company further the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit based on us geological maps also dictates the number of holes drilled

the generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows

proven reserves – these reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in us geologic maps the us department of agriculture soil maps aerial photographs andor electromagnetic seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms the proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps safety benches pillars underground and the fines small particles that will be generated during processing proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines the company typically assumes a loss factor of 25 however the assumed loss factor at coastal operations is approximately 40 due to the nature of the material the assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35 primarily due to pillars 

probable reserves – these reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties 

the company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and also include reserves at the company’s inactive and undeveloped sites including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth the company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section

mineral reserves and mineral interests when acquired in connection with a business combination are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves

the company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its unitsofproduction calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests for 2020 depletion expense was 359 million

the company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements

new mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves when this occurs management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related preproduction development costs if the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves further a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred once a new mining area enters the production phase all postproduction stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs

further increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability if these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past construction spending could be reduced cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations 

the company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets this concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables however payment bonds normally posted on public projects together with lien rights on private projects mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables the level of demand in the company’s enduse markets production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the building materials business and therefore profitability production costs in the building materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices both directly and indirectly diesel fuel coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energyrelated input costs such as steel explosives tires and conveyor belts fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs primarily through fuel surcharges in the company’s longhaul distribution network the magnesia specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas

transportation in the company’s longhaul network particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains affects the company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets most notably texas colorado florida north carolina and the gulf coast in addition availability of railcars and locomotives affects the company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the company’s plant in manistee michigan and its customers the availability of trucks drivers and railcars to transport the company’s product particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand is also a risk and pressures the associated costs 

all of the company’s businesses are also subject to weatherrelated risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability the first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather hurricane activity in the atlantic ocean and gulf coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters 

risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the company’s control 

in addition to the foregoing other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements in this annual report include but are not limited to those listed above in item 1 “business – competition ” item 1a “risk factors” and “note a accounting policies” and “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

you should consider these forwardlooking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 and other filings made with the sec all of the company’s forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of these factors in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forwardlooking statements or adversely affect or be material to the company all forwardlooking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements

 item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as discussed earlier the company’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries consequently these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs see business environment section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k 

management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues further delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty

demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates during 2020 the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate and at december 31 2020 the rate was 009 the residential construction market accounted for approximately 24 of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2020 

aside from these inherent risks from within its operations the company’s earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates 

variablerate borrowing facilities

at december 31 2020 the company had a 700 million revolving facility and a 400 million trade receivable facility borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate as of december 31 2020 the company did not have any outstanding variablerate debt however any future borrowings under the credit facilities or outstanding variablerate debt are exposed to interest rate risk 

pension expense

the company’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and for the defined benefit pension plans only the expected longterm rate of return on assets therefore the company has interest rate risk associated with these factors the impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the company’s annual pension expense is discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates – pension expense – selection of assumptions section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k

energy costs 

energy costs including diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and liquid asphalt represent significant production costs of the company the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products the cement product line and magnesia specialties business each have varying fixedprice agreements for a portion of their energy requirements a hypothetical 10 change in the company’s energy prices in 2021 as compared with 2020 assuming constant volumes would change 2021 energy expense by 231 million 

commodity risk

cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the company’s control increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand which can have a negative impact on product prices there can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations a hypothetical 10 change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by 453 million 

cement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products a hypothetical 10 change in cement costs in 2021 compared with 2020 assuming constant volumes would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by 255 million while increases in cement pricing may negatively impact the profitability of the ready mixed concrete operations the cement business would benefit although the positive impact may not reflect a direct correlation to the impact to the ready mix business

general

martin marietta materials inc the “company” or “martin marietta” is a natural resourcebased building materials company the company supplies aggregates crushed stone sand and gravel through its network of more than 300 quarries mines and distribution yards in 27 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands in the western united states martin marietta also provides cement and downstream products namely ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving services in markets where the company has a leading aggregates position specifically the company has two cement plants in texas and ready mixed concrete and asphalt operations in texas colorado louisiana arkansas and wyoming paving services are exclusively in colorado the company’s heavyside building materials are used in infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction projects aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast the aggregates cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the “building materials” business the company also operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio the magnesia specialties business produces magnesiabased chemical products that are used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel and mining industries magnesia specialties’ products are shipped to customers worldwide 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded

the company completed over 90 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its aggregatesled presence in the building materials marketplace this included an exchange of certain assets in 2011 with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregates quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado and the i25 corridor in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river called the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment 

the business has developed further through the following transactions over the past few years 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi was a major supplier of natural aggregates in texas in northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma and arkansas txi was the then largest supplier of cement and ready mixed concrete products in texas txi enhanced the company’s position as an aggregatesled lowcost operator in large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states adding 800 million tons of aggregates to the company’s reserves and provided highquality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in connection with the txi acquisition the company acquired nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired two cement plants in midlothian texas south of dallas and hunter texas north of san antonio and approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas as part of an agreement in conjunction with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

txi was also a cement producer in california in 2015 the company divested its california cement operations acquired from txi these operations were not in close proximity to aggregates and other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production the divestiture primarily included a cement plant two distribution terminals mobile equipment intangible assets and inventory the company also completed the integration of the txi operations in 2015 and completed three smaller acquisitions the same year which included three aggregates operations and related assets

in 2016 the company acquired aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations in southern colorado that provided more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expanded the company’s presence along the front range 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

of the rocky mountains home to 85 of colorado’s population the company also acquired the remaining and controlling interest in a ready mixed concrete company that serves the i35 corridor in central texas between dallas and austin which enhanced the company’s position and provided additional vertical integration benefits with the company’s cement product line 

in 2018 the company completed the acquisition of bluegrass materials company “bluegrass” the then largest privately held pureplay aggregates business in the united states with a portfolio of 22 active sites acquired by the company the operations provided more than 22 billion tons or approximately 125 years of strategicallylocated highquality reserves in georgia south carolina tennessee maryland kentucky and pennsylvania these operations complemented the company’s existing southeastern footprint in its midamerica and southeast groups and provided a new growth platform within maryland and kentucky 

between 2001 and 2019 the company disposed of a number of underperforming operations including aggregates ready mixed concrete trucking and asphalt and road paving operations of its building materials business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2015 the company disposed of certain noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas and divested its california cement operations divestitures in 2018 also included those required as part of the governmental approval associated with the acquisition of bluegrass consisting of one site owned by bluegrass and one site operated by the company the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming or nonstrategic assets if appropriate during 2020 consistent with its strategic plan and in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities

business segment information

the company conducts its building materials business through three reportable segments organized by geography midamerica group southeast group and west group the midamerica and southeast groups provide aggregates products only the west group provides aggregates cement and downstream products our top ten states accounted for 86 of the building materials business total revenues in 2019 texas colorado north carolina georgia iowa florida south carolina indiana maryland and nebraska the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses for more information on the organization and geographic area of the company’s business segments see “note a accounting policiesorganization” and “note p segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” 

building materials business

this section describes the product lines of the building materials business undertaken by the company within its midamerica group southeast group and west group the company operates its aggregates product line of business in all of these geographic segments within its building materials business in 2019 the aggregates product line represented 62 of the company’s consolidated total products and services revenues the company’s cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are conducted within the company’s west group with its two cement plants in texas and the remaining ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines in texas colorado louisiana arkansas and wyoming paving services are offered exclusively in colorado the company’s cement product line is described below and in greater detail in the next section 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions including precipitation flooding hurricanes snowstorms extreme temperatures and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone and sand and gravel manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group the company’s aggregates reserves are 89 years on average at current production levels 

cement is the basic binding agent used to bind water aggregates and sand in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these plants produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 80 to 85 utilization in 2019 the midlothian plant permit allows the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates several cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily of cement water aggregates and sand is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines such as dirt and clay the company operates 141 ready mix plants in texas colorado louisiana arkansas and wyoming asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt operations are located primarily in colorado additionally paving services are offered in colorado market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement 

the building materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with 35 of the aggregates product line shipments in 2019 made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states therefore these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments 

as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles the historic level of spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable due to predictability of funding from federal state and local governments with approximately half of the funding from federal government and half from state and local governments in certain states the fixing america’s surface transportation act the “fast act” signed into law on december 4 2015 is the first longterm transportation funding bill in nearly a decade and authorizes 305 billion over fiscal years 2016 through 2020 included with fast act funding is 300 million available for loans issued under transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act “tifia” if a successor bill is not passed prior to the september 2020 expiration of the fast act management expects continuing resolutions to be passed to continue federal highway funding at current levels public construction projects once awarded are seen through to completion thus delays from weather or other factors typically serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding in november 2019 270 state and local ballot initiatives 89 of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote were approved and are estimated to generate over 96 billion in onetime and recurring revenues namely texas colorado georgia and north carolina approved measures that will contribute a total of 81 billion to infrastructure funding the majority of which are in texas since 2010 81 of transportation ballot initiatives have been approved by voters funding from the fast act coupled with state and local transportation initiatives has resulted in an acceleration in lettings making contracts available for bidding and contract awards in key states including texas colorado north carolina georgia and florida the pace of construction should accelerate and shipments to the public infrastructure market should return to historical levels as monies from both the federal government and state and local governments become awarded

publicsector construction related to transportation infrastructure can be aggregates intensive and is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal highway bill currently the fast act provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

since most states are required to balance their budgets reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states’ expenditures however the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources such as highway user fees or whether portions are funded with general funds 

states continue to play an expanding role in infrastructure investment in addition to federal appropriations each state funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees over the past several years states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes  management believes that financing at the state level such as bond issuances toll roads and tax initiatives will grow at a faster rate in the near term than federal funding state infrastructure spending generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company the level of state publicworks spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state the state economies of the building materials business’ ten largest revenuegenerating states may disproportionately affect the company’s financial performance

governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than privatesector spending obligations of federal funds is a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states before a state or local department of transportation can solicit bids on an eligible construction project it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress

the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding a large number of roads highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 are now in need of major repair or reconstruction according to the road information program “trip” a national transportation research group vehicle travel on united states highways increased 17 from 2000 to 2017 while new lane road mileage increased only 5 over the same period trip also reports that 44 of the nation’s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 9 of the nation’s bridges are structurally deficient according to the 2015 american association of state highway and transportation officials’ transportation bottom line report annual investment in the nation’s roads highways and bridges needs to increase from 88 billion to 120 billion to improve conditions and meet the nation’s mobility needs while state dots and contractors are addressing their funding and labor constraints the company believes that with an enhanced infrastructure bill those efforts would be more rapidly addressed however even in the absence of an enhanced infrastructure bill strong customer confidence and improving sentiment leads management to believe that infrastructure activity for 2020 and beyond should benefit from the fast act and its eventual successor bill the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “2017 tax act” and additional state and local infrastructure initiatives 

funding of public infrastructure the company’s largest enduse market is discussed in greater detail under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—building materials business’ key considerations—public infrastructure the company’s largest enduse market is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations’’ of this form 10k 

the company’s building materials business covers a wide geographic area the five largest salesgenerating states texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa for the building materials business accounted for 72 of total revenues by state of destination in 2019 the company’s building materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s building materials business

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and an ocean vessel network where the permile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

product shipments are moved by rail water and truck through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2019 the distribution network available to the company consisted of 86 terminals the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of their aggregates products particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location 

the company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregates mines the company operates 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to move material by rail the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water associated internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margin this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability railcar availability and locomotive availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including among other items meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports

the company’s longterm shipping contracts for shipment by water are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that these contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it is still obligated to pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2019 the company did not incur these freight costs however a charge is possible in 2020 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns historically in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and generally required customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing demands for rail service 

more recently railroads have increasingly begun emphasizing precision scheduled railroading “psr” which is focused on minimizing railcar dwell time and utilizing general purpose trains by blending existing train services the company does not expect the railroads’ use of psr to materially impact its operations in 2020 however if the railroads do not efficiently execute on this change it could disrupt shipment volumes for the company 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southwest and southeast coastal markets

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the industry’s consolidation when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance pit development or other standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion or efficiency projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy recovered from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors the “board of directors” and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company’s west group became more vertically integrated through various acquisitions including the 2014 txi acquisition in which the company acquired not only aggregates locations but also complementary cement ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving construction operations the company reports verticallyintegrated operations within the building materials business segment and their results are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results prices for liquid asphalt were higher in 2019 than in 2018 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products we expect the company’s gross margin to continue to improve for the legacy txi aggregatesrelated downstream operations similar to the pattern experienced at the colorado aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

while aggregatesled the company continues to review its operational portfolio to determine if there are opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent building materials operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own independent operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates product line’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates product line the company’s aggregates reserves are 89 years on average based on current production levels however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

cement product line

the cement product line of the building materials business produces portland and specialty cements cement is the basic binding agent for concrete a primary construction material the principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in texas similar to aggregates cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector 

the company has a strategic cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and in hunter texas north of san antonio these plants have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons as well as a current permit that would allow the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons at the midlothian plant in addition to these production facilities the company also operates directly or through third parties several cement distribution terminals in texas 

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october approximately 75 of all cement shipments are sent to ready mix concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concreterelated products contractors materials dealers and oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities

energy accounted for approximately 22 of the cement production cost profile in 2019 therefore profitability of the cement product line is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance and this process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the two cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

the cement product line generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

magnesia specialties business

the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility the magnesia specialties business manufactures magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee michigan facility these magnesiabased chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2019 69 of magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products 30 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

in 2019 81 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 19 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 35 of the magnesia specialties’ total revenues in 2019 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 80 in 2019 according to the american iron and steel institute average steel production in 2019 increased 18 versus 2018 

in the magnesia specialties business a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for approximately 62 of its 2020 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs for 2019 the company’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas decreased 47 versus 2018 

given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that product line is not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesiumrich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

after the raw materials are combined to make magnesium hydroxide the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in 2010 occidental chemical corporation “occidental” acquired interests in and became the counterparty to a longterm processed brine supply agreement previously entered into by magnesia specialties pursuant to which occidental purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in occidental’s production of calcium chloride products occidental also succeeded as magnesia specialties’ partner in a joint venture to own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and occidental’s facility in ludington michigan 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia “risk factors” of this form 10k 

patents and trademarks

as of february 7 2020 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 23 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 94 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole

customers

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates product line tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in 90 of the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors

there are over 5000 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 4547 of the total market the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with approximately 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are approximately 4000 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company with its building materials business including its ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the building materials industry 

the largest us aggregates producers including global companies other than the company include

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products while the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2019 were predominantly from north america a portion was derived from customers located outside the united states 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 98 cement plants in 34 states cement companies in the united states have annual sales valued at approximately 107 billion the top five companies collectively operate 625 of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 188 of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 86 of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states in reporting these figures for cement plants capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity “clinker” is the initial product of cement production cement producers mine materials such as limestone shale or other materials crush and screen the materials and place them in a cement kiln after being heated to extremely high temperatures these materials form marblesized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement 

the company’s strategic cement product line competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement product line also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in texas certain of the company’s competitors in the cement product line have greater financial resources than the company 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from quarries or mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are often large verticallyintegrated companies with international operations ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large verticallyintegrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including co 2 and other greenhouse gases and water discharges waste management noise and dust exposure control reclamation and environmental health and safety regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a fulltime team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 260 million in 2019 and 253 million in 2018 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 11 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately 15 million in 2020 and 2021 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2019 and 2018 however the company’s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite the company’s compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future

many of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may in the ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws moreover the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes as such an allocation would be arbitrary the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances at this time the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition

the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k the company performs activities on an ongoing basis as an integral part of the normal quarrying process that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives  safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration “msha” for ongoing operations as

well as final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are from time to time available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s consolidated financial statements included under item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k and the “environmental regulation and litigation” section included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company

in general mining and production facilities for aggregates cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality water quality and other environmental regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites and production facilities are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines and production facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer msha and the occupational safety and health administration “osha” have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices since much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act

amid concerns that greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reporting or reductions the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the us the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of ghgs report those emissions the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business release carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime magnesium oxide and hydroxide products the company’s two magnesiabased chemicals facilities as well as its two cement plants in texas file annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa reporting rule the primary operations of the company however including its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg emissions in fact most of the ghg emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment

in 2010 the usepa also issued a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v operating permit programs the us supreme court ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the best available control technology “bact” requirements for ghgs emitted by sources already subject to psd or title v permitting requirements for other pollutants both of our cement plants as well as our magnesia specialties plants hold title v permits and each other than the manistee michigan facility is also subject to psd requirements it is not known whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of its rules in response to the court’s decision or what the usepa would require as bact in fact no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency thus if future modifications to our facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg bact requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time 

the company believes that comprehensive federal climate change legislation is not a nearterm priority item in a divided congress and that the primary method that ghgs will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed

if and when congress passes additional legislation on ghgs the woodville ohio and manistee michigan magnesia specialties operations as well as the company’s two cement plants in texas which release co 2 in certain of their processes and use carbonbased fuels for power equipment kilns and the company’s mobile fleet will likely be subject to any new requirements the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement operations facilities would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation however compete against other products that due to the form andor structure of the source material require less energy in the calcination process resulting in the generation of fewer ghgs per ton of production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market in light of the various regulatory uncertainties the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or building materials businesses the company continues to monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business financial condition and product demand

in addition to impacts from increased regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business and cement product line correlate with general construction activity which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states notably the carolinas florida and georgia where they impacted the company’s facilities in 2019 more cold and wet weather than is typical adversely impacted our rocky mountain concrete asphalt and paving businesses 

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact our customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for our products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks

notwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change there may also be opportunities for the company to increase its business or revenues for example warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively which could have meaningful positive impacts on the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively in addition the company’s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries including both coal and gasfired electricity generation which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and ghg emissions by more ghgintense companies

 



 

part i ♦ item 1 – business

in an effort to mitigate the risks to the company associated with ghg emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability the company has adopted a corporatewide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate ghg reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies including using alternative fuels such as biodiesel reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems rightsizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips and by replacing older rail cars with more efficient highcapacity models that reduce the number of required trips adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements and installing emissions monitoring equipment and realtime fleet management software for example in 2015 the company’s midlothian cement plant was recognized by the usepa as a high performing energy efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels

general risk factors

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects as a result of these issues several of our top sales generating states from timetotime stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments

we sell most of our aggregates products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on that industry’s strength since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the great recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s the “great recession” was an example and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our building materials business of texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the great recession 

the great recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry recent years however have shown a slow but steady turnaround in this trend the current economic expansion in the united states which began in 2009 has now become the longest economic recovery in united states history 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the federal highway bill in 2014 contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of a new federal highway bill 

our building materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather which can significantly impact operations  

since the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the building materials product lines’ production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically are strongest in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s building materials business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather and thus are generally the least profitable weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated over the last few years by record precipitation in many of our key markets notably the eastern seaboard and texas importantly inclement weather was most significant during the second and third quarters which represents the height of the construction season these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in the last few years so our results for those years or in comparison to other years may not be indicative of our future operating results the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in 2019 hurricane dorian and tropical storm imelda temporarily disrupted the company’s business

competition and growth risk factors

our building materials business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically

our challenge is to find aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods including rail and water while our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical we can give no assurances that we will be successful

our businesses face many competitors

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

products as other examples our aggregates ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving product lines may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement product line may compete with international competitors who are importing products to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our acquisition of txi in 2014 and our acquisition of bluegrass in 2018 in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing longterm shareholder return

our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations our largest business acquisition was txi which closed in july 2014 in 2015 we completed the integration of txi’s operations into our own operations ahead of schedule which allowed us to achieve and exceed the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we had forecasted at the time of the acquisition in 2018 we completed the integration of the operations of bluegrass into our own operations in a manner that surpassed the publicly stated synergy estimates provided at the closing of the transaction however in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to do similar to the acquisition of txi or bluegrass would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations based on our history we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include















 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that















our cement product line and magnesia specialties business may become capacityconstrained

if our cement product line or magnesia specialties business becomes capacityconstrained they may be unable to timely satisfy the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacityconstrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize while we are permitted to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons at our midlothian plant it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition 

our cement product line could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement product line

economic political and legal risk factors

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment health and safety and other areas of the law as well as litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including ghgs and water discharges waste management noise and dust control reclamation and other environmental health and safety matters govern our operations some of our operations require permits which may impose additional operating standards and are subject to modification renewal and revocation despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations the risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses these potential liabilities could result in material costs including for fines or personal injury or damages claims which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs we could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition an unexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our company

climate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business including potential physical and financial impacts

amid concerns that ghg emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a cap and trade system and a carbon tax for example in the us the usepa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering ghg emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the usepa has also promulgated a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act although the us supreme court subsequently ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule the court upheld the socalled “best available control technology” requirements for ghgs emitted by sources that already require title v operating permits or are subject to psd requirements for other pollutants thus if future modifications to our magnesia specialties or cement facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg permitting requirements may also be triggered which could require us to incur significant additional costs

although the operations of the company’s aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg emissions any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact the company’s magnesiabased chemicals operations in woodville ohio and manistee michigan as well as its two cement plants in texas each of which file annual reports of ghg emissions as required by the usepa reporting rule it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time in addition the company may not be able to recover any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at those plants from its customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets

in addition to impacts from increased ghg and other climaterelated regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition given the nature of our operations physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business and cement operations correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact our customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for our products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks 

the overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources

our products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the current federal highway bill the fast act which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs the fast act however only reauthorized federal infrastructure funding through 2020 so must be reauthorized this year if not reauthorized this year the company anticipates some level of funding would be continued with continuing resolutions the uncertainty of federal funding has led to the increase in state and alternative methods of infrastructure funding we expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state level in 2020 at the federal level we expect to see some increased infrastructure spending in 2020 resulting from the fast act funding but will be dependent on a successor fast act bill or continuing resolutions in the future for any greater federal impact on funding any enhanced federal infrastructure bill will require congressional approval we cannot be assured however of such approval or of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas “apportionments” or other procedures “allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states after the great recession experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues or other inability to finance approved projects for example north carolina was among the states that experienced these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina’s improved in 2014 and later years as increased tax revenues helped resolve budget constraints north carolina infrastructure spending recently has been restrained by spending required elsewhere for storm relief and litigation settlements despite these restraints the north carolina general assembly has provided interim financial relief for north carolina to continue to fund its infrastructure spending 

during the past several years many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates 

as discussed previously our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

for example demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates in 2019 the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 15 to 175 cutting the rate three times during the year at its december 2019 meeting the federal reserve held the federal funds rate steady and signaled its desire to maintain the rate at that level during 2020 this course of action continued at its january 2020 meeting when the federal reserve again held rates steady and changed little in its economic outlook as the united states economy continued to extend its longest expansion on record there can be no assurance however that interest rates will not increase in the future affecting our business in an adverse manner the residential construction market accounted for 22 of our aggregates product line shipments in 2019 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below

increases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including





















any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

personnel risks

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses

labor unions represent approximately 10 of the hourly employees of our building materials business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2023 and june 2022 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

financial accounting and cost management risk factors 

our business is a capitalintensive business

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read the critical accounting policies and estimates section included under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the form 10k

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market had been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

 



 

part i ♦ item 1a – risk factors

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt it is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding variablerate debt and the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products outside the united states therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar in 2019 the strength of the us dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the magnesia specialties business when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2019 the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 263 million during the year in 2019 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 44 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time

our paving operations present additional risks to our business

our paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixedprice contracts we guarantee project completion by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our paving operations we also have fixedprice and fixedunitprice contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement product lines due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore if we expand these operations our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 104 for 2019 and 103 for 2018 the overall gross margin of our building materials business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines

suppliers raw materials and energy costs risk factors 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we may enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk our last fixedprice commitment for a portion of our diesel fuel requirements expired at the end of 2016 

the average cost per gallon of diesel fuel was 208 229 and 181 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively for 2019 the average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas decreased 47 versus 2018 which had decreased approximately 4 from 2017 levels 

the company’s magnesia specialties business has fixedprice agreements for 62 of its 2020 coal natural gas and petroleum coke needs the cement operations have fixedprice agreements for a portion of their 2020 coal and natural gas needs

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 22 of the 2019 direct production costs of our cement product line therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement product line profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 263 million and 173 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively 

similarly our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials liquid asphalt prices were higher in 2019 than in 2018 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is sensitive to supply and price volatility

cement competition is often based primarily on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally decline we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages

cyber and information security risk factors 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure including reliance on thirdparty vendors and thirdparty software any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network we cannot assure you that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

other risk factors

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or water we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

some of our product is distributed by barge along rivers in ohio and west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following

building materials business 

as of december 31 2019 the company processed or shipped aggregates from more than 300 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 27 states canada and the bahamas of which 124 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 59 are on land owned in part and leased in part 109 are on leased land and 10 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average represent 89 years at current production levels however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2019 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 148 properties in five states of which 124 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances one is on land owned in part and leased in part and 23 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site “greensite” an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement product line as it does for its aggregates product line for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates  property plant and equipment” included under article 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

 



 

part i ♦ item 2 – properties

during 2019 the principal properties of the aggregates product line were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 75 to 80 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand the company adjusts its production schedules to meet volume demand for its products for example during the great recession the company reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities when business improved the company was able to gradually resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increased 

during 2019 the texas cement plants operated on average at 80 to 85 utilization the portland cement association “pca” has projected that cement consumption will slow modestly in 2020 from 2019 with the rate of change decreasing in 2020 to 17 from 24 in 2019 the cement product line’s leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency due to the “247365” nature of cement operations significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

the company expects future organic earnings growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current assets and portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70 and the strength of the united states dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment the dolomitic lime business of the magnesia specialties segment operated at 80 utilization in 2019

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the building materials business is a mature cyclical business dependent on activity within the construction marketplace as of december 31 2019  the nation’s current economic expansion which started in june 2009 has lasted 126 months and is the longest economic recovery in history  by comparison the average troughtopeak expansionary cycle since 1938 was 60 months during the current economic expansion however governmental uncertainty labor shortages and logistical challenges have tempered the recovery pace of growth of heavy construction activity resulting in a slow steady extended construction cycle that is expected to continue over the next several years the level of economic recovery varies within the company’s geographic footprint 

magnesia specialties

the company operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio the magnesia specialties business produces magnesiabased chemicals products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel and mining industries magnesia specialties’ products are shipped to customers worldwide 

consolidated strategic objectives

the company’s strategic planning process or s trategic o perating a nalysis and r eview soar provides the framework for execution of martin marietta’s longterm strategic plan guided by this framework and considering the cyclicality of the building materials business the company determines capital allocation priorities to maximize longterm shareholder value the company’s strategy includes ongoing evaluation of aggregatesled opportunities of scale in new domestic markets ie platform acquisitions expansion through acquisitions that complement existing operations ie bolton acquisitions divestitures of assets that are not consistent with stated strategic goals and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar or complementary businesses the company finances such opportunities with the goal of preserving its financial flexibility by having a leverage ratio consolidated debttoconsolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda within a target range of 20 times to 25 times within a reasonable time following the completion of a debtfinanced transaction

the company by purposeful design will continue to be an aggregatesled business aggregates product revenues represented 62 of 2019 total consolidated products and services revenues that focuses on markets with strong underlying growth fundamentals where it can sustain or achieve a leading market position driven by this intentional approach the company has leading positions in 90 of its markets as part of its longterm strategic plan the company may pursue strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities for martin marietta strategic cement and targeted downstream operations are located in verticallyintegrated markets where the company has or envisions a clear path toward a leading aggregates position additionally strategic cement operations are attractive where market supply cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water

generally the company’s building materials products are both sourced and sold locally as a result geography is critically important when assessing market attractiveness and growth opportunities attractive geographies exhibit a population growth andor population density both of which are drivers of heavyside building materials consumption b business and employment diversity drivers of greater economic stability and c a superior state financial position a driver of public infrastructure growth and support

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

in order to assess population growth and density the company focuses on the megaregions of the united states megaregions are large networks of metropolitan population centers covering thousands of square miles according to america 2050  a planning and policy program of the regional plan association a majority of the nation’s population and economic growth through 2050 will occur in 11 megaregions the company has a presence in most of the megaregions as evidence of the successful execution of soar the company’s leading positions in the texas triangle and colorado’s front range megaregions and its enhanced position in the piedmont atlantic primarily in the atlanta area are the results of acquisitions since 2011 additionally the 2018 acquisition of bluegrass materials company bluegrass provided the company with a new growth platform within the southern portion of the northeast megaregion the company has a legacy presence in the southeastern portion of the great lakes megaregion encompassing operations in indiana and ohio the megaregions and the company’s key states are more fully discussed in the building materials business’ key considerations section 

 

in considering business and employment diversity the company focuses its geographic footprint along significant transportation corridors particularly where land is readily available for the construction of fulfillment andor data centers the retail sector values transportation corridors as logistics and distribution are critical considerations for construction supporting that industry in addition technology companies view these areas as attractive locations for data centers

additionally the company considers a state’s financial position in determining the opportunities and attractiveness of areas for expansion or development in this assessment a state’s financial health rating issued by sp global ratings and where aaa is the highest score is reviewed the company’s top ten revenuegenerating states have been assigned a financial health rating of aa or aaa the company also reviews the state’s ingenuity to securing additional infrastructure sourcing

business environment 

building materials business 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics 

the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore erratic weather patterns precipitation and other weatherrelated conditions including flooding hurricanes snowstorms cold temperatures and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation the impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the building materials business’ key considerations section 

product lines

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone and sand and gravel manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is also the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group the company’s aggregates reserves represent 89 years on average at the current production level 

cement is the basic binding agent used to bind water aggregates and sand in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in the texas market with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these two facilities produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 80 to 85 utilization in 2019 the midlothian plant has a permit that allows for annual capacity expansion of 08 million tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates several cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily of cement water aggregates and sand is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines ie dirt and clay the company operates 141 ready mix plants in texas colorado louisiana arkansas and wyoming asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt operations and paving services are located in colorado market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement

enduse trends 





♦ total value of construction put in place decreased less than 1 

♦ public construction spending increased 7 

♦ private nonresidential construction market spending was flat 

♦ private residential construction market spending decreased 5 

the principal enduse markets of the building materials business are public infrastructure ie highways streets roads bridges and schools nonresidential construction ie manufacturing and distribution facilities industrial complexes office buildings large retailers and wholesalers and energyrelated activity and residential construction ie subdivision development and single and multifamily housing aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast collectively comprising the chemrockrail market 

public infrastructure jobs can require several years to complete while residential and nonresidential construction jobs are usually completed within one year generally the purchase orders the company receives from its customers do not contain firm quantity commitments regardless of enduse market therefore management does not utilize a company backlog in managing its business

the public infrastructure market accounted for 35 of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2019 modestly improved weather compared with 2018 allowed transportation projects to advance however company’s shipments to this enduse market remain below the most recent fiveyear average of 39 and tenyear average of 45 

while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles  the historic level of spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable due to predictability of funding from federal state and local governments with approximately half of the funding from federal government and half from state and local governments in certain states the fixing america’s surface transportation act fast act signed into law on december 4 2015 is the first longterm transportation funding bill in nearly a decade and authorizes 305 billion over fiscal years 2016 through 2020 included with fast act funding is 300 million available for loans issued under transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act tifia if a successor bill is not passed prior to the september 2020 expiration of the fast act management expects congressional continuing resolutions to be passed to continue federal highway funding at current levels public construction projects once awarded are seen through to completion thus delays from weather or other factors typically serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding in november 2019 270 state and local ballot initiatives 89 of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote were approved and are estimated to generate over 96 billion in onetime and recurring revenues namely texas colorado georgia and north carolina approved measures that will contribute a total of 81 billion to infrastructure funding the majority of which are in texas since 2010 81 of transportation ballot initiatives have been approved by voters funding from the fast act coupled with state and local transportation initiatives has resulted in an acceleration of lettings making contracts available for bidding and contract awards in key states including texas colorado north carolina georgia and florida the pace of construction should accelerate and shipments to the public infrastructure market should return to historical levels as monies from both the federal government and state and local governments become awarded

the nonresidential construction market accounted for 3 6  of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2019  while national nonresidential construction spending was relatively flat  the company’s shipments to this end use increased 22  compared with 2018 reflecting growth in the construction of distribution centers warehouses data centers wind turbines and energysector projects in key states  the dodge momentum index a twelvemonth leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgrawhill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 was 1562 in december 2019 compared with 1519 in december 2018 this suggests nonresidential construction activity will remain healthy over the next several years 

 

 

the residential construction market accounted for 22 of the company’s aggregates shipments in 2019 although private residential construction spending decreased 5 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 compared with 2018 according to the us census bureau the company’s shipments increased 14 to this end use reaffirming location matters the residential construction market like the nonresidential construction market is interest rate sensitive and typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles the company’s exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions including roads sidewalks utilities and storm and sewage drainage aggregates used in new singlefamily home construction and aggregates used in construction of multifamily units construction of both subdivisions and singlefamily homes is more aggregates intensive than construction of multifamily units through an economic cycle multifamily construction generally begins early in the cycle and then transitions to singlefamily construction therefore the timing of new subdivision starts as well as new singlefamily housing permits are strong indicators of residential volumes residential housing starts of 13 million units for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 were flat compared with the comparable 2018 period and remain below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 national housing permits decreased 27 over the comparable period the company expects continued growth in the residential market driven by low interest rates favorable demographics job growth land availability and efficient permitting 

 

the remaining 7 of the company’s 2019 aggregates shipments was to the chemrockrail market which includes ballast and agricultural limestone ballast is an aggregates product used to stabilize railroad track beds and increasingly concrete rail ties are being used as a substitute for wooden ties agricultural lime a highcalcium carbonate material is used as a supplement in animal feed a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer additionally chemrockrail includes rip rap which is used as a stabilizing material to control erosion caused by water runoff at embankments ocean beaches inlets rivers and streams and highcalcium limestone which is used as filler in glass plastic paint rubber adhesives grease and paper chemicalgrade highcalcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants 

pricing trends 

pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreedupon price during a definitive period since infrastructure projects span multiple years announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the company sells products under existing price agreements pricing escalators included in multiyear infrastructure contracts somewhat mitigate this effect however during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs multiyear infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth additionally the company may implement midyear price increases on a marketbymarket basis where appropriate pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market

in 2019  the average selling price for the aggregates product line increased 42  in line with management’s expectations 

 

 

 

cost structure 

direct production costs for the building materials business are components of cost of revenues incurred at the quarries mines distribution yards and facilities cement plants ready mixed concrete plants and asphalt plants cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility and production overhead costs 

generally the significant components of direct production costs for the building materials business are 1 labor and related benefits 2 raw materials 3 depreciation depletion and amortization dda 4 repairs and maintenance 5 energy 6 contract services and 7 supplies in 2019 these categories represented 91 of the building materials business’ total direct production costs 

variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume accordingly the company’s operating leverage can be substantial production is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours further components of energy supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes 

generally when the company invests capital in facilities and equipment increased capacity and productivity along with reduced labor and repair costs can offset increased fixed depreciation costs however the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lowerdemand environment resulting in under absorption of fixed costs

wage and benefit inflation and increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy further workforce reductions resulting from process automation and mobile fleet right sizing primarily in the aggregates operations have mitigated rising labor costs during economic downturns the company reviews its operations and where practical temporarily idles certain sites the company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close

proximity i n certain markets management can create production “super crews” that work on a rotating basis at various locations within a district for example within a market a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry this has allowed the company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand 

the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines require the use of raw materials in the production of their products cement and liquid asphalt are key raw materials in the production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results liquid asphalt prices were 14 higher in 2019 versus 2018 but may not always proportionately follow changes in the prices of other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process when converting a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement production is a capitalintensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate all day every day with the exception of maintenance shutdowns kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2019 and 2018 the cement operations incurred outage costs of 263 million and 173 million respectively the increase in outage costs in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily attributable to timing of scheduled maintenance shutdowns the company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns 

diesel fuel represents the single largest component of energy costs for the building materials business the average cost per gallon was 208 and 229 in 2019 and 2018 respectively changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires further the company’s contracts of affreightment for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range 

the impact of inflation on the company’s businesses has not been significant historically the company has achieved pricing growth in periods of inflation based on its ability to increase its selling prices in a normal economic environment

growth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a longhaul distribution network

the us department of the interior’s geological map of the united states depicts the possible sources of indigenous surface rock and illustrates its limited supply in certain areas of the united states including the coastal areas from virginia to texas further certain interior united states markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning permitting andor environmental laws and regulations the company’s longhaul distribution network is used to supplement or in many cases wholly supply the local crushed stone needs in these areas 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of aggregates products particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location 

product shipments are moved by rail water and truck through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2019 the distribution network available to the company consisted of 86 terminals 

the company’s increased dependence on rail shipments has made it more reliant on railroad performance issues including track congestion  crew and availability the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts further changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the company’s rail network 

a portion of railcars and all ships of the company’s longhaul distribution network are under short and longterm leases some with purchase options and contracts of affreightment the limited availability of water and rail transportation providers coupled with limited distribution sites can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rate the company has not purchased ships

the company has longterm agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports these contracts of affreightment are takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements the minimum requirements were met in 2019 the company’s waterborne contracts of affreightment have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that such contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases 

the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and deepwater ships provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the southwest and southeast coastal markets 

public infrastructure the company’s largest enduse market is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans publicsector construction related to transportation infrastructure can be aggregates intensive and is funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal highway bill currently the fast act provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

since most states are required to balance their budgets reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states’ expenditures however the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources such as highway user fees or whether portions are funded with general funds 

states continue to play an expanding role in infrastructure investment in addition to federal appropriations each state funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees over the past several years states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes  management believes that financing at the state level such as bond issuances toll roads and tax initiatives will grow at a faster rate in the near term than federal funding state infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company the level of state publicworks spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state the state economies of the building materials business’ ten largest revenuegenerating states may disproportionately affect the company’s financial performance

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than privatesector spending obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states before a state or local department of transportation can solicit bids on an eligible construction project it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress 

the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding a large number of roads highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 are now in need of major repair or reconstruction according to the road information program trip a national transportation research group vehicle travel on united states highways increased 17 from 2000 to 2017 while new lane road mileage increased only 5 over the same period trip also reports that 44 of the nation’s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 9 of the nation’s bridges are structurally deficient according to the 2015 american association of state highway and transportation officials’ transportation bottom line report annual investment in the nation’s roads highways and bridges needs to increase from 88 billion to 120 billion to improve conditions and meet the nation’s mobility needs while state dots and contractors are addressing their funding and labor constraints the company believes that with an enhanced infrastructure bill those efforts would be more rapidly addressed however even in the absence of an enhanced infrastructure bill strong customer confidence and improving sentiment leads management to believe that infrastructure activity for 2020 and beyond should benefit from the fast act and its eventual successor bill the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 2017 tax act and additional state and local infrastructure initiatives 

in addition to highways and bridges transportation infrastructure includes aviation mass transit and ports and waterways railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements according to the american road  transportation builders association subway and light rail work is expected to benefit slightly from the fast act 

erratic weather can significantly impact operations

production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather seasonal changes and other climaterelated conditions which can significantly affect the business typically due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity as such temperature plays a significant role in the months of march and november meaningfully affecting the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively where warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively 

excessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in 2019 hurricane dorian and tropical storm imelda temporarily disrupted the company’s operations 

capital investment decisions driven by capital intensity of the building materials business and focus on land

the company’s organic capital program is designed to leverage construction market growth through investment in both permanent and portable facilities at the company’s operations over an economic cycle the company typically invests organic capital at an annual level that approximates depreciation expense at midcycle and through cyclical peaks organic capital investment typically exceeds depreciation expense as the company supports current capacity needs and invests for future capacity growth conversely at a cyclical trough the company may reduce levels of capital investment regardless of

cycle the company sets a priority of investing capital to ensure safe environmentallysound and efficient operations  as well as to provide the highest quality of customer service and establish a foundation for future growth 

the company is diligent in its focus on land opportunities including potential new sites greensites and expanding locations land purchases are usually opportunistic and require the company to be flexible in its ability to secure land land purchases can include contiguous property around existing quarry locations such property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and an extension of quarry life

magnesia specialties business

the magnesia specialties business manufactures magnesia based chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee michigan facility the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility of 2019 total revenues 69 were attributable to chemicals products 30 were attributable to lime and 1 was attributable to stone 

in 2019 81 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 19 was used internally as a raw material for the business’ manufacturing of chemicals products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are primarily used by the steel industry and overall 35 of magnesia specialties’ 2019 total revenues related to products used in the steel industry accordingly a portion of the segment’s revenues and profits is affected by production and inventory trends within the steel industry which are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors steel production in 2019 increased 18 compared with 2018 the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 80 in 2019 the chemical products business focuses on highermargin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volumes that support efficient operations 

total revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2019 were predominantly derived from domestic customers and no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the total revenues for the company financial results can be affected by foreign currency exchange rates increasing transportation costs or weak economic conditions in foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effect of currency exchange rates foreign transactions are denominated in united states dollars however the current strength of the united states dollar in foreign markets is affecting the overall price of magnesia specialties’ products when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

a significant portion of the magnesia specialties business’ costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the company has fixed price agreements for approximately 62 of its 2020 energy needs for coal natural gas and petroleum coke for 2019 the segment’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet of natural gas decreased 47 versus 2018 given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results of operations 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

management expects future organic profitability growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the risks mentioned in the longhaul distribution discussion in the building materials business’ key considerations section

environmental regulation and litigation 

the expansion and growth of the aggregates industry is subject to increasing challenges from environmental and political advocates aiming to control the pace and direction of future development certain environmental groups have published lists of targeted municipal areas including areas within the company’s marketplace for environmental and suburban growth control the effect of these initiatives on the company’s growth is typically localized further challenges are expected as the momentum of these initiatives ebb and flow across the united states rail and other transportation alternatives are being heralded by these specialinterest groups as solutions to mitigate road traffic congestion and overcrowding 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may occasionally use substances classified as toxic or hazardous the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation new permits are generally required for opening new sites or for expansion at existing operations and can take several years to obtain in the area of land use rezoning and special or conditional use permits are increasingly difficult to obtain once a permit is issued the location is required to generally operate in accordance with the approved site plan 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s two cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust ckd this byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts are often treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act

the clean air act originally passed in 1963 and periodically updated by amendments is the united states’ national air pollution control program that granted the environmental protection agency epa authority to set limits on the level of various air pollutants to be in compliance with national ambient air quality standards a defined geographic area must be below established limits for six pollutants environmental groups have been successful in lawsuits against the federal and certain state departments of transportation delaying highway construction in municipal areas not in compliance with the clean air act the epa designates geographic areas as nonattainment areas when the level of air pollutants exceeds the national standard nonattainment areas receive deadlines to reduce air pollutants by instituting various control strategies or otherwise face fines or control by the epa included as nonattainment areas are several major metropolitan areas in the company’s markets such as houstonbrazoriagalveston texas dallasfort worth texas denver colorado boulder colorado fort collinsgreeleyloveland colorado council bluffs iowa atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana and baltimore maryland federal transportation funding has been directly tied to compliance with the clean air act

noncash adjustment is recorded in other nonoperating expenses net consistent with the recurring classification of equity earnings from the affiliate 

income tax expense 

variances in the estimated effective income tax rates when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves the effect of state income taxes stock compensation deductions and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized additionally certain acquisitionrelated expenses net have limited deductibility for income tax purposes

the permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate the statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations due to these limitations changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate however the impact of the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings 

the company’s estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 182 and 183 respectively

other financial information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates require management’s subjective and complex judgments amounts reported in the company’s consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates resulting in actual results differing from those estimates methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates as well as the related disclosures have been reviewed by and discussed with the company’s audit committee management’s determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict 

impairment review of goodwill 

goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment an interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment the impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represents 24 of the company’s total assets at december 31 2019 the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions and an impairment charge could be material to the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company performs its impairment evaluation as of october 1 which represents the annual evaluation date

the company’s reporting units which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment are based on the operating segments of the building materials business there is no goodwill related to the magnesia specialties business 

certain of the aforementioned reporting units within the building materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting 

goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting units based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation if subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value which represents a step1 analysis however prior to step 1 the company may perform an optional qualitative assessment as part of the qualitative assessment the company considers among other things the following events and circumstances macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and other business or reporting unitspecific events if the company concludes it is morelikelythannot ie a likelihood of more than 50 that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value the company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit otherwise it proceeds to step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in step 1 when the company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further calculation is necessary a reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a step1 failure and results in an impairment charge

for the 2019 annual impairment evaluation the company performed a step1 analysis for all reporting units the fair values were calculated using a discounted cash flow model key assumptions included management’s estimates of changes in sales price shipment volumes and production costs as well as assumptions of future profitability capital requirements discount rates ranging from 85 to 925 and a terminal growth rate of 25 with the exception of the cement and southwest ready mix division the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 150 the cement and southwest ready mix division reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 35 or 7015 million for sensitivity purposes a 100basispoint increase in the discount rate holding all other assumptions constant would result in the cement and southwest ready mix division reporting unit passing the step1 analysis by 3435 million or 17 the cement and southwest ready mix division reporting unit had 9347 million of goodwill at december 31 2019 

future profitability and capital requirements are by their nature estimates price cost and volume assumptions were based on various factors including historical averages and current forecasts external sources and market conditions while also considering any production capacity constraints capital requirements included maintenancelevel needs and known efficiency and capacityincreasing investments

a discount rate is calculated for each reporting unit that requires a step1 analysis and represents its weighted average cost of capital the calculation of the discount rate includes the following components which are primarily based on published 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

sources equity risk premium historical beta riskfree interest rate smallstock premium companyspecific premium and borrowing rate 

the terminal growth rate was based on average gdp increases

management believes that all assumptions used were reasonable based on historical operating results and expected future trends however if future operating results are unfavorable as compared with forecasts the results of future goodwill impairment evaluations could be negatively affected further mineral reserves which represent underlying assets producing the reporting units’ cash flows for the aggregates product line are depleting assets by their nature any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the company

pension expenseselection of assumptions 

the company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a supplemental excess retirement plan serp for certain retirees see note k to the audited consolidated financial statements annual pension expense inclusive of serp expense consists of several components









these components are calculated annually to determine the pension expense reflected in the company’s results of operations 

management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense dependent on selected assumptions the key assumptions are as follows









management’s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for highquality fixedincome investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations the company selected a hypothetical portfolio of moody’s aa bonds with maturities that match the benefit obligations to determine the discount rate at december 31 2019 the company selected a discount rate assumption of 369 a 69basispoint decrease compared with the prioryear assumption of the four key assumptions the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate accordingly a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

management’s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels is generally based on the company’s historical salary increases including cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases considering any known future trends a higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense the assumed longterm rate of increase is 45 

management’s selection of the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a buildingblock approach whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets given that these returns are long term there are generally not significant fluctuations in the expected rate of return from year to year based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses the company selected an expected return on assets of 675 the same as the prioryear rate the following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets

 



 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is not immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings rather pension accounting rules require the difference to be included in actuarial gains and losses which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described

at december 31 2019 the company estimates the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the society of actuaries’ pri2012 base mortality table the nocollar table was used for salaried participants and the bluecollar table was used for hourly participants both reflecting the experience of the company’s participants the company selected the mp2018 scale for mortality improvement

assumptions are selected on december 31 to calculate the succeeding year’s expense for the 2019 pension expense assumptions selected at december 31 2018 were as follows

 



 

using these assumptions 2019 pension expense was 365 million a change in the assumptions would have had the following impact on 2019 expense 





for 2020 pension expense assumptions selected at december 31 2019 were as follows



 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

using these assumptions 2020 pension expense is expected to be approximately  312 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the 2020 expected expense 





the company made pension plan contributions of 589 million in 2019 and 3508 million during the fiveyear period ended december 31 2019 despite these contributions the company’s pension plans are underfunded projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets by 1098 million at december 31 2019 the company’s projected benefit obligation was 9778 million at december 31 2019 an increase of 1299 million versus the prior year driven by the lower discount rate the company expects to make pension plan and serp contributions of 602 million in 2020 of which 500 million are voluntary

the company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes accordingly the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management’s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the result is management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate the “etr” 

income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the united states internal revenue code and the statutes of various foreign state and local tax jurisdictions in which the company conducts business changes in the statutory tax rates andor tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the etr the effect of these changes if material is recognized when the change is enacted 

as prescribed by these tax regulations as well as generally accepted accounting principles the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same therefore these differences between the company’s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent depending on their nature

temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period an example of a temporary difference is the use of the straightline method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities ie future tax deductions or future taxable income therefore when temporary differences occur they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account as such total income tax expense as reported in the company’s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences 

the company has deferred tax liabilities primarily for property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangibles employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures the deferred tax liabilities attributable to property plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straightline and unitsofproduction methods used for financial reporting purposes these temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets the deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes this temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes either through divestitures or an impairment charge the timing of such events cannot be estimated the deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards the reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the company’s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes the temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture

the company has deferred tax assets primarily for inventories unvested stockbased compensation awards unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans valuation reserves net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards the deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes the reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes the deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stockbased compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes for financial reporting purposes the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period for income tax purposes no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture the company records all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period 

business combinations – allocation of purchase price 

the company’s board of directors and management regularly review strategic longterm plans including potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesses which would increase the company’s market share andor are related to the company’s existing markets when an acquisition is completed the company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date control is obtained the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition additionally conversion of the seller’s equity awards into equity awards of the company can affect the purchase price the company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions further the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are not amortized can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price a fairvalue measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants considering the use of the asset that is physically possible legally permissible and financially feasible at the measurement date the company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options







level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publiclytraded entities and assumed obligations for publiclytraded longterm debt

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables inventories machinery and equipment land buildings deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accruals for payables asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligations and contingencies additionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products and separatelyidentifiable intangible assets the fair values of mineral reserves and mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach which requires management to estimate future cash flows net of capital investments in the specific operation and contributory asset charges the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include changes in sales price shipment volumes and production costs as well as capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the company values separatelyidentifiable acquired intangible assets which may include but are not limited to permits customer relationships water rights and noncompetition agreements the fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or in the case of water rights a market approach 

the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings the selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the company subsequent to the business combination

the company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are based on the company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurementperiod adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction the measurement period ends once the company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings

property plant and equipment 

net property plant and equipment represent 51 of total assets at december 31 2019 accordingly accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors including production levels geographic location portability and maintenance practices additionally climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset historically the company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets

aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets the company evaluates aggregates reserves including those used in the cement manufacturing process in several ways depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite an acquisition or an existing operation greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section the depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site further the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable if the company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties for quality control calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves 

wellordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location this subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling the company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable locations underlain with hard rock deposits such as granite and limestone are drilled using the diamond core method which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use the number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the sitespecific geology some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults folds chemical irregularities clay pockets thickness of formations and weathering a typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous 

despite previous drilling and sampling once accessed the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary construction contracts for the infrastructure market in particular include specifications related to the aggregates material if a flaw in the deposit is discovered the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for nonspecification uses this can have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the company’s profitability in addition other issues can arise that limit the company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry including geological occurrences blasting practices and zoning issues

locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method whereby a sixinch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

additionally the quality and sandtogravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling 

the geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the company further the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit based on us geological maps also dictates the number of holes drilled

the generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows

proven reserves – these reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in us geologic maps the us department of agriculture soil maps aerial photographs andor electromagnetic seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms the proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps safety benches pillars underground and the fines small particles that will be generated during processing proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines the company typically assumes a loss factor of 25 however the assumed loss factor at coastal operations is approximately 40 due to the nature of the material the assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35 primarily due to pillars 

probable reserves – these reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties 

the company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and also include reserves at the company’s inactive and undeveloped sites including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth the company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting see environmental regulation and litigation section

mineral reserves and mineral interests when acquired in connection with a business combination are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves

the company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its unitsofproduction calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests for 2019 depletion expense was 375 million

the company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements

new mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves when this occurs management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related preproduction development costs if the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves further a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred once a new mining area enters the production phase all postproduction stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs

realized within the expected time period including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the company’s leverage ratio debt covenant changes in tax laws the interpretation of such laws andor administrative practices that would increase the company’s tax rate violation of the company’s debt covenant if price andor volumes return to previous levels of instability downward pressure on the company’s common stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations the possibility of a reduction of the company’s credit rating to noninvestment grade shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the company’s control the history of both cement and ready mixed concrete being subject to significant changes in supply demand and price fluctuations and other risk factors listed from time to time found in the company’s filings with the sec  further increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability if these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past construction spending could be reduced cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations the magnesia specialties business essentially runs at capacity therefore any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment 

the company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets this concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables however payment bonds normally posted on public projects together with lien rights on private projects mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables the level of demand in the company’s enduse markets production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the building materials business and therefore profitability production costs in the building materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices both directly and indirectly diesel fuel coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energyrelated input costs such as steel explosives tires and conveyor belts fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs primarily through fuel surcharges in the company’s longhaul distribution network the magnesia specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas

transportation in the company’s longhaul network particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains affects the company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets most notably texas colorado florida north carolina and the gulf coast in addition availability of rail cars and locomotives affects the company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the company’s plant in manistee michigan and its customers the availability of trucks drivers and railcars to transport the company’s product particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand is also a risk and pressures the associated costs 

all of the company’s businesses are also subject to weatherrelated risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability the first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather hurricane activity in the atlantic ocean and gulf coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters in fact in september and october 2018 respectively hurricanes florence and michael generated winds rainfall and flooding which disrupted operations in the carolinas florida and georgia in 2019 hurricane dorian and tropical storm imelda temporarily disrupted the company’s operations in the bahamas and texas respectively however after flood waters recede management typically expects an increase in construction activity as roads homes and businesses are repaired 

risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the company’s control 

in addition to the foregoing other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements in this annual report include but are not limited to those listed above in item 1 “business – competition ” item 1a “risk factors” and “note a accounting policies” and “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

 

 

 

 



 

part ii ♦ item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk




 item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as discussed earlier the company’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries consequently these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs see business environment section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k 

management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues further delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty

demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates during 2019 the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate several times throughout the year the rate at december 31 2019 was 155 the residential construction market accounted for approximately 22 of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2019 

aside from these inherent risks from within its operations the company’s earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates 

variablerate borrowing facilities

at december 31 2019 the company had a 700 million revolving facility and a 400 million trade receivable facility the company also has 300 million of variablerate senior notes outstanding borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate a hypothetical 100basispoint increase in interest rates on borrowings of 640 million which was the collective outstanding balance at december 31 2019 would increase interest expense by 64 million on an annual basis 

pension expense

the company’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and for the defined benefit pension plans only the expected longterm rate of return on assets therefore the company has interest rate risk associated with these factors the impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the company’s annual pension expense is discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates – pension expense – selection of assumptions section included under item 7 – mda of this form 10k

energy costs 

energy costs including diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and liquid asphalt represent significant production costs of the company the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products the cement product line and magnesia specialties business each have varying fixedprice agreements for a portion of their energy requirements a hypothetical 10 change in the company’s energy prices in 2020 as compared with 2019 assuming constant volumes would change 2020 energy expense by 279 million 

commodity risk

cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the company’s control increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand which can have a negative impact on product prices there can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations a hypothetical 10 change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by 439 million excluding the net impact of internal sales 

cement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete the company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the company’s products a hypothetical 10 change in cement costs in 2020 compared with 2019 assuming constant volumes would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by 245 million

limitations on the effectiveness of controls

the companys management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the company completed over 90 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its aggregatesled presence in the building materials marketplace this included an exchange of certain assets in 2011 with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregates quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado and the i25 corridor in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river called the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment 

the business has developed further through the following transactions over the past five years 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi as a standalone entity was a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states and a major supplier of natural aggregates and ready mixed concrete in texas northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma and arkansas txi was the largest supplier of cement ready mixed concrete and concrete products in texas txi enhanced the company’s position as an aggregatesled lowcost operator in large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states and provided highquality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in addition to the cement operations the company acquired as part of the txi acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas as part of an agreement in conjunction with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

txi was also a cement producer in california in 2015 the company divested its california cement operations acquired from txi these operations were not in close proximity to aggregates and other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production the divestiture primarily included a cement plant two distribution terminals mobile equipment intangible assets and inventory the company also completed the integration of the txi operations in 2015 and completed three smaller acquisitions which included three aggregates operations and related assets 

in 2016 the company acquired aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations in southern colorado that provided more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expanded the company’s presence along the front range of the rocky mountains home to 80 of colorado’s population the company also acquired the remaining interest it had not previously owned in a ready mixed concrete company that serves the i35 corridor in central texas between dallas and austin which enhanced the company’s position and provided additional vertical integration benefits with the company’s cement product line

in 2018 the company completed the acquisition of bluegrass materials company “bluegrass” the largest privately held pureplay aggregates business in the united states with a portfolio of 22 active sites acquired by the company the operations provided more than 22 billion tons or 125 years of strategicallylocated highquality reserves in georgia south carolina tennessee maryland kentucky and pennsylvania these operations complement the company’s existing southeastern footprint in its midamerica and southeast groups and provide a new growth platform within maryland and kentucky the company has surpassed its 15 million run rate synergy target 

between 2001 and 2018 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates ready mixed concrete trucking and asphalt and road paving operations of its building materials business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2015 the company disposed of certain noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas and divested its california cement operations divestitures in 2018 also included those required as part of the governmental approval associated with the acquisition of bluegrass consisting of one site owned by bluegrass and one site operated by the company the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets if appropriate during 2019 consistent with its strategic plan and in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company conducts its building materials business through three reportable segments organized by geography midamerica group southeast group and west group the midamerica and southeast groups provide aggregates products only the west group provides aggregates cement and downstream products our top 10 states accounted for 85 of the building materials business total revenues in 2018 texas colorado north carolina georgia iowa florida south carolina indiana maryland and nebraska the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses 

building materials business 

this section describes the product lines of the building materials business undertaken by the company within its midamerica group southeast group and west group the company operates its aggregates product line of business in all of these geographic segments within its building materials business in 2018 the aggregates product line represented 61 of the company’s consolidated total revenues the company’s cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are conducted within the company’s west group with its two cement plants in texas and the remaining ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines in texas colorado louisiana and arkansas paving services are exclusively in colorado the company’s cement product line is described below and in greater detail in the next section 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of publicsector infrastructure funding interest rates access to capital markets and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics the heavyside construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore precipitation and other weatherrelated conditions including flooding hurricanes snowstorms and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation 

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone sand and gravel of varying mineralogies manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group on average the company’s aggregates reserves exceed 75 years based on normalized production levels and approximate 100 years at current production rates 

cement is the basic binding agent used to bind water aggregates and sand in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these plants produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 75 to 80 utilization in 2018 the midlothian plant permit allows the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates four cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily of cement water aggregates and sand is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready

mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines such as dirt and clay the company operates 140 ready mix plants in texas colorado louisiana and arkansas asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt or bitumen the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt operations are located primarily in colorado additionally paving services are offered in colorado market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement 

the building materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with 39 of the aggregates product line shipments in 2018 made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states therefore these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments 

as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions since the expiration of the prior federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century “map21” the fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america’s surface transportation act the “fast act” or the “act” was signed into law on december 4 2015 the fast act reauthorizes federal highway and public transportation programs and stabilizes the highway trust fund the fast act retains the programs supported under the predecessor bill map21 but with some changes specifically transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” a us department of transportation “dot” alternative funding mechanism which under map21 provided three types of federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects now allows more diversification of projects tifia is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private coinvestment by providing projects with supplemental or subordinate debt that is not subject to national debt ceiling challenges or sequestration since inception tifia has provided more than 25 billion of credit assistance to over 50 projects representing over 90 billion in infrastructure investment under the fast act tifia annual funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state dots consequently states can advance construction projects immediately with potentially zero upfront outlay of local state dot dollars tifia requires projects to have a revenue source to pay back the credit assistance within a 30 to 40 year period the tifia program has the ability to significantly leverage construction dollars private investment in transportation projects funded through the tifia program is particularly attractive in part due to the subordination of public investment to private management believes tifia could provide a substantial boost for state dot construction programs well above what is currently budgeted as of january 2019 tifia financed projects for the company’s top five salesgenerating states texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa exceeded 30 billion since the inception of the program with tifia assistance for such projects exceeding 8 billion according to tifia 

public infrastructure activity has not yet experienced the anticipated benefits from funding provided by the fast act and the tifia program state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding management believes that funding at the state level will grow at a faster rate than federal funding state spending on infrastructure generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company the pace of construction should accelerate and shipments to the public infrastructure market should return to historical levels as monies from both the federal government and state and local governments become available a return to historical shipment volumes should be facilitated by state dots and contractors as they address their respective labor constraints the level of state publicworks spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state the state economies of the building materials business’ five largest salesgenerating states may disproportionately affect the company’s financial performance 

the federal highway bill provides spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas

tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans according to the federal highway administration every 1 billion in federal highway investment creates approximately 28000 jobs the number of jobs created is often dependent on the nature and aggregates intensity of the projects approximately half of the building materials business’ total revenues from the infrastructure enduse market come from federal funding authorizations including matching funds from the states for each dollar spent on road highway and bridge improvements the federal highway administration estimates an average benefit of 520 is recognized in the form of reduced vehicle maintenance costs reduced delays reduced fuel consumption improved safety reduced road and bridge maintenance costs and reduced emissions as a result of improved traffic flow 

the company’s building materials business covers a wide geographic area the five largest salesgenerating states texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa for the building materials business accounted for 72 of total revenues by state of destination in 2018 the company’s building materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s building materials business 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the permile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

product shipments are moved by rail water and truck through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida colorado and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2018 the distribution network available to the company consisted of 98 distribution facilities the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of their aggregates products particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail water andor truck to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location 

the company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregates mines the company operates 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries 

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to move material by rail the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margin this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the

customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability railcar availability and locomotive availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including among other items meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts for shipment by water are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that these contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it is still obligated to pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2018 the company did not incur these freight costs however a charge is possible in 2019 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns historically in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and generally required customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing demands for rail service 

more recently some railroads have begun emphasizing precision scheduled railroading“psr” which is focused on minimizing railcar dwell time and utilizing general purpose trains by blending existing train services the company does not expect the railroads’ shift to psr to materially impact its operations in 2019 however if the railroads do not efficiently execute on this change it could disrupt shipment volumes for the company 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southwest and southeast coastal markets 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy recovered from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated through various acquisitions including the 2014 txi acquisition in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired cement ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving construction operations trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations the company reports verticallyintegrated operations within the building materials business segment and their results are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these 

 

 part i ◆   item 1  business 

 

raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2018 prices for liquid asphalt were higher than 2017 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products we expect the company’s gross margin to continue to improve for the legacy txi aggregatesrelated downstream operations similar to the pattern experienced at the colorado aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

while aggregatesled the company continues to review its operational portfolio to determine if there are opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent building materials operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own independent operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the 2014 business combination with txi further expanded the company’s downstream operations with the addition of txi’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations the txi combination also added the cement operations included in the west group as the cement product line of the company the 2016 transactions described under general above further added ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations along the front range in colorado and ready mixed concrete operations in central texas the 2018 acquisition of bluegrass provided the company an attractive opportunity to acquire the largest privatelyheld pureplay aggregates business in the united states 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates product line’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates product line the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 75 years based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

cement product line 

the cement product line of the building materials business produces portland and specialty cements cement is the basic binding agent for concrete a primary construction material the principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in texas similar to aggregates cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector 

the company has a strategic cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and in hunter texas north of san antonio these plants have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons as well as a current permit that would allow the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons at the midlothian plant in addition to these production facilities the company also operates directly or through third parties four cement distribution terminals in texas 

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october approximately 75 of all cement shipments are sent to readymix concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concrete related products contractors materials dealers oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities 

energy including electricity and fossil fuels accounted for approximately 23 of the cement production cost profile in 2018 therefore profitability of the cement product line is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance this process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future

the cement product line generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility additionally at its manistee michigan facility magnesia specialties manufactures magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2018 70 of magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products 29 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials 

in 2018 81 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 19 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 33 of the magnesia specialties’ total revenues in 2018 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 78 in 2018 according to the american iron and steel institute average steel production in 2018 increased 62 versus 2017 

in the magnesia specialties business a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the magnesia specialties business has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2019 coal needs approximately 50 of its 2019 natural gas needs and 100 of its 2019 petroleum coke needs for 2018 the company’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas decreased 4 versus 2017 

given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that product line is not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line 

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesiumrich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the raw materials are combined to make magnesium hydroxide the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a joint venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of its facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with magnesia specialties 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln completed in 2012 at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia risk factors of this form 10k 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 8 2019 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 23 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 96 trademarks related to business the company believes that its 

 

 part i ◆   item 1  business 

 

rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates product line tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in 90 of the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5000 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with approximately 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are approximately 4000 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company with its building materials business including its ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the building materials industry 

the largest us aggregates producers including global companies other than the company include

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products while the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2018 were predominantly from north america a small but growing amount was derived from customers located outside the united states 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 97 cement plants in 34 states the top five companies collectively operate 595 of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 187 of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 86 of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states in reviewing these figures for cement plants capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity “clinker” is the initial product of cement production cement producers mine materials such as limestone shale or other materials crush and screen the materials and place them in a cement kiln after being heated to extremely high temperatures these materials form marblesized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement 

the company’s cement product line competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement product line also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets certain of the company’s competitors in the cement product line have greater financial resources than the company 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from stone quarries or mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is

moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are typically large verticallyintegrated companies with international operations ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large verticallyintegrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including greenhouse gases and water discharges waste management noise and dust exposure control reclamation and other environmental health and safety regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 253 million in 2018 and 234 million in 2017 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 14 million in 2018 and are expected to be approximately 15 million in 2019 and 2020 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2018 and 2017 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may in the ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2018 consolidated financial statements the “2018 financial statements” which are included in the company’s 2018 annual report to shareholders “2018 annual report” filed as exhibit 1301 to this form 10k the company performs activities on an ongoing basis as an integral part of the normal quarrying process that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives – safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are from time to time available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2018 financial statements included in the 2018 annual report filed as exhibit 1301 to this form 10k and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental regulation and litigation” included in the 2018 annual report filed as exhibit 1301 to this form 10k however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry mining and production facilities for cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites and production facilities are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines and production facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 

amid concerns that greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reporting or reductions the use of

alternative fuels carbon credits such as a “cap and trade” system and a carbon tax for example in the us the united states environmental protection agency the “usepa” promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of ghgs report those emissions the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business release carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime magnesium oxide and hydroxide products the company’s two magnesiabased chemicals facilities as well as its two cement plants in texas file annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa reporting rule the primary operations of the company however including its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg emissions in fact most of the ghg emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment 

in 2010 the usepa also issued a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v operating permit programs the us supreme court ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule but upheld the best available control technology “bact” requirements for ghgs emitted by sources already subject to psd or title v permitting requirements for other pollutants both of our cement plants as well as our magnesia specialties plants hold title v permits and each other than the manistee michigan facility is also subject to psd requirements it is not known whether the usepa will proceed with revisions of its rules in response to the court’s decision or what the usepa would require as bact in fact no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency thus if future modifications to our facilities require psd review for other pollutants ghg bact requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time 

the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in a divided congress in the near future and that the primary method that ghgs will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

if and when congress passes additional legislation on ghgs the woodville ohio and manistee michigan magnesia specialties operations as well as the company’s two cement plants in texas which use carbonbased fuels for power equipment kilns and the company’s mobile fleet will likely be subject to any new requirements the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement operations facilities would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation however compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production these other products include natural magnesites produced around the world by calcining magnesium carbonate and also naturally occurring and mined magnesium hydroxide powder brucite products production of magnesium products from these other sources requires less energy resulting in the generation of fewer ghgs per ton of production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market in light of the various regulatory uncertainties the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or building materials businesses the company continues to monitor ghg regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business financial condition and product demand 

in addition to impacts from increased regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts which could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business and cement product line correlate with general construction activity which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states notably the carolinas florida and georgia where they impacted the company’s facilities for example according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration “noaa” hurricane florence in the third quarter of 2018 caused catastrophic flooding in portions of north carolina and south carolina noaa also reported that 2018 marked the wettest year for nine states including north carolina maryland virginia west virginia and tennessee these events along with significant precipitation in texas adversely impacted our aggregates production and shipments as well as our other businesses in those areas during the year 

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels

or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact our customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for our products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks 

notwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change there may also be opportunities for the company to increase its business or revenues for example warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allows the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively which could have meaningful positive impacts on the company’s first and fourthquarter results respectively in fact 2018 marked the 22nd consecutive warmerthanaverage year for the contiguous united states and five states including north carolina and south carolina had a record warmest year the extended warmer periods helped the company deliver record revenues and profitability for the full year in addition the company’s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries including both coal and gasfired electricity generation which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and ghg emissions by more ghgintense companies 

in an effort to mitigate the risks to the company associated with ghg emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability the company has adopted a corporatewide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate ghg reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies including using alternative fuels such as biodiesel reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems rightsizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips and by replacing older rail cars with more efficient highcapacity models that reduce the number of required trips adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements and installing emissions monitoring equipment and realtime fleet management software for example in 2015 the company’s midlothian cement plant was recognized by the usepa as a highperforming energyefficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels

 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “will” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the company and may be material to the company the company has listed the known material risks it considers relevant in evaluating the company and its operations the forwardlooking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the exchange act these forwardlooking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current expectations and the company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

for a discussion identifying some important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements see the factors listed below along with the discussion of “competition” under item 1 of this form 10k “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2018 annual report and “note a accounting policies” and “note o commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2018 financial statements included in the 2018 annual report filed as exhibit 1301 to this form 10k 

general risk factors 

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects as a result of these issues several of our top sales generating states from timetotime stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregates products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the great recession was an example and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

 

 part i ◆   item 1a  risk factors 

 

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our building materials business of texas colorado north carolina georgia and iowa our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the great recession 

the great recession of 2008 resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry recent years however have shown a slow but steady turnaround in this trend the united states is currently experiencing the secondlongest economic recovery since the great depression 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the federal highway bill in 2014 contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of a new federal highway bill 

our building materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather which can significantly impact operations 

since the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the building materials product lines’ production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically are strongest in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s building materials business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather and thus are generally the least profitable weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated over the last few years by record precipitation in many of our key markets notably the eastern seaboard and texas importantly inclement weather was most significant during the second and third quarters which represents the height of the construction season these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in the last few years so our results for those years or in comparison to other years may not be indicative of our future operating results 

the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in september 2018 hurricane florence the secondwettest storm in 70 years and ranking only behind hurricane harvey made landfall in the carolinas as a category 4 storm bringing with it 13 trillion gallons of rain in texas hurricane harvey a category 4 storm that made landfall in houston in august 2017 brought nearly 20 trillion gallons of precipitation in the southeast hurricane irma also a category 4 storm made landfall in florida in september 2017 and brought excessive rainfall to the southeastern united states notably florida and georgia in october 2016 rainfall along the eastern seaboard of the united states from hurricane matthew a category 5 hurricane approximated 14 trillion gallons hurricane matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the bahamas where the company has a facility these hurricanes generated winds rainfall and flooding which disrupted operations in texas louisiana florida georgia the carolinas and the bahamas 

competition and growth risk factors 

our building materials business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods including rail and water while our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

 

 item 1a  risk factors   ◆ part i 

 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving product lines may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement product line may compete with international competitors who are importing products to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our acquisition of txi in 2014 and our acquisition of bluegrass in 2018 in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock for example we used our common stock for our acquisition of txi we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing longterm shareholder return 

our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected 

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations our largest business acquisition was txi which closed in july 2014 in 2015 we completed the integration of txi’s operations into our own operations ahead of schedule which allowed us to achieve and exceed the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we had forecasted at the time of the acquisition in 2018 we completed the integration of the operations of bluegrass into our own operations in a manner that surpassed the publicly stated synergy estimates provided at the closing of the transaction however in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to do similar to the acquisition of txi or bluegrass would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations based on our history we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our cement product line and magnesia specialties business may become capacity constrained 

if our cement product line or magnesia specialties business becomes capacity constrained they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity constrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize while we are permitted to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons at our midlothian plant it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition 

our cement product line could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws 

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement product line 

economic political and legal risk factors 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use air emissions including greenhouse gases and water discharges waste management noise and dust control reclamation and other environmental health safety regulatory matters govern our operations some of our operations require permits which may impose additional operating standards and are subject to modification renewal and revocation despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations the risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses these potential liabilities could result in material costs including for fines or damages claims which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 

future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs we could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals 

 

 item 1a  risk factors   ◆ part i 

 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition an unexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our company 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business including potential physical and financial impacts 

amid concerns that ghg emissions are contributing to climate change a number of governmental bodies including the us congress and various us states have proposed enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change including provisions for emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels carbon credits such as a “cap and trade” system and a carbon tax for example in the us the usepa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering ghg emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the usepa has also promulgated a ghg emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for ghg emissions under the us clean air act although the us supreme court subsequently ruled in june 2014 that the usepa exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the tailoring rule the court upheld the socalled “best available control technology” requirements for ghgs emitted by sources that already require title v operating permits or are subject to psd requirements for other pollutants thus if future modifications to our magnesia specialties or cement facilities require review of the applicability of permitting requirements due to other pollutants ghg permitting requirements may also be triggered which could require us to incur significant additional costs 

although the operations of the company’s aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg emissions any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact the company’s magnesiabased chemicals operations in woodville ohio and manistee michigan as well as its two cement plants in texas each of which file annual reports of ghg emissions as required by the usepa reporting rule it is not possible however to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time in addition the company may not be able to recover any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at those plants from its customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets 

in addition to impacts from increased weatherrelated regulation climate change may result in physical and financial impacts which could have adverse effects on the company’s operations or financial condition given the nature of our operations physical impacts may include disruptions in production andor regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities as well as flooding from sea level changes in addition production and shipment levels for the building materials business and cement operations correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect that business excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas and the southeastern united states in addition climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset 

our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels we could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations these and other climaterelated risks also could impact our customers such as a downturn in the construction sector which could lead to reduced demand for our products the company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to mitigating these risks 

 

 part i ◆   item 1a  risk factors 

 

the overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified near the end of 2015 with the passage of the current federal highway bill the fast act which reauthorizes federal highway and transportation funding programs the fast act also changes the transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects under the fast act tifia funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state dots while the total value of united states overall publicworks spending increased in 2018 federal funding through the fast act did not impact highway spending in any meaningful way lettings accelerated during the year but weather contractor capacity and logistics dampened construction activity during the year the increase in overall public works spending in 2018 demonstrates the commitment of states to address the underlying demand for infrastructure investment we expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state level in 2019 at the federal level we expect to see some increased infrastructure spending in 2019 resulting from the fast act funding but greater impact from the fast act funding or an enhanced federal infrastructure bill is not expected until 2020 or later any enhanced federal infrastructure bill will require congressional approval we cannot be assured however of such approval or of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states after the great recession experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects for example north carolina was among the states that experienced these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina improved in 2014 and later years as increased tax revenues helped resolve budget constraints 

during the past several years many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates 

as discussed previously our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

 

 item 1a  risk factors   ◆ part i 

 

for example demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates in 2018 the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate to 25 percent the residential construction market accounted for 22 of our aggregates product line shipments in 2018 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results historically our profitability has increased during periods of rising interest rates in essence our underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below 

increases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

personnel risks 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent approximately 10 of the hourly employees of our building materials business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2019 and june 2022 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

financial accounting and cost management risk factors 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

 

 part i ◆   item 1a  risk factors 

 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2018 financial statements 

reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market had been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding variablerate debt and the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies located outside the united states therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar in 2018 the strength of the us dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the magnesia specialties business when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

 

 item 1a  risk factors   ◆   part i 

 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2018 the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 173 million during the year in 2018 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 58 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time 

our paving operations present additional risks to our business 

our paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixedprice contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our paving operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement product lines due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore if we expand these operations our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 103 for 2018 and 127 for 2017 the overall gross margin of our building materials business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines 

suppliers raw materials and energy costs risk factors 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we may enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk our last fixedprice commitment for a portion of our diesel fuel requirements expired at the end of 2016 

the average cost per gallon of diesel fuel was 229 181 and 196 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively pricing in 2016 reflects an unfavorable fixedprice agreement which expired on december 31 2016 for 2018 the average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas decreased 4 versus 2017 which had increased approximately 33 from 2016 levels 

the company has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2019 coal needs approximately 50 of its 2019 natural gas needs and 100 of its 2019 petroleum coke needs 

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 23 of the 2018 direct production costs of our cement product line therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement product line profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 173 million and 140 million during 2018 and 2017 respectively 

 

 part i ◆   item 1a  risk factors 

 

similarly our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials liquid asphalt prices were higher in 2018 than in 2017 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility 

cement is a commodity and competition is often based mainly on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally decline we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

cyber and information security risk factors 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network we cannot assure you that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

other risk factors 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi 

 

 item 1a  risk factors   ◆   part i 

 

river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations

our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

 additionally the occurrence of certain changeofcontrol events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments

building materials business 

as of december 31 2018 the company processed or shipped aggregates from more than 300 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 26 states canada and the bahamas of which 124 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 61 are on land owned in part and leased in part 110 are on leased land and 10 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 75 years based on normalized levels of production and approximate 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2018 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 149 properties in five states of which 126 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances one is on land owned in part and leased in part and 22 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement product line as

 cement product line 

as of december 31 2018 the company through its subsidiaries processed or shipped cement from six properties in one state of which four are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and two are on leased land the company’s cement product line has production facilities located at two sites in texas midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth hunter texas north of san antonio the following table summarizes certain information about the company’s cement manufacturing facilities at december 31 2018 

 

 reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2844 acres of land owned by the company as of december 31 2018 the company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 692 million tons 

the company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns crushers preheaterscalciners coolers finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries these cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck 

as of december 31 2018 the company through its subsidiaries also operated directly or through third parties four cement distribution terminals and owned the real estate at the california cement grinding and packaging facility it sold on september 30 2015 which it expects to sell for noncement use 

magnesia specialties business

condition and utilization 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

during 2018 the principal properties of the aggregates product line were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand the company adjusts its production schedules to meet volume demand for its products for example the company reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of 

 

 item 2  properties   ◆ part i 

 

its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2018 the company’s aggregates product line operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 445 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idling could continue the company expects however it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 

during 2018 the texas cement plants operated on average at 75 to 80 utilization the portland cement association “pca” has projected that cement consumption will slow modestly in 2019 from 2018 with the rate of change decreasing in 2019 to 26 from 29 in 2018 the cement product line’s leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency due to the 247365 nature of cement operations significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

the company expects future organic earnings growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current assets and portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70 and the strength of the united states dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment the dolomitic lime business of the magnesia specialties segment operated at 74 utilization in 2018

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2018 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included in the annual report filed as exhibit 1301 to this form 10k under the heading “statement of financial responsibility and management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting” and is incorporated by reference the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2018 

management has excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of bluegrass materials company bluegrass from its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 because it was acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2018 subsequent to the acquisition certain elements of bluegrass’ internal control over financial reporting and related processes were integrated into the company’s existing systems and internal control over financial reporting those controls that were not integrated have been excluded from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 the excluded elements represent controls over accounts of less than 1 of consolidated assets and 4 of consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended december 31 2018 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource 

 

 item 9a  controls and procedures   ◆ part ii 

 

constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

ceo and cfo certifications 

included among the exhibits to this form 10k are forms of “certifications” of the company’s ceo and cfo as required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certification” the section 302 certifications refer to this evaluation of the company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

 item 1 business tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” or “martin marietta” is a naturalresourcebased building materials company the company supplies aggregates crushed stone sand and gravel through its network of 282 quarries and distribution yards to customers in 30 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands in the western united states martin marietta also provides cement and downstream products namely ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving services in markets where the company has a leading aggregates position specifically the company has two cement plants in texas and ready mixed concrete and asphalt operations in texas colorado louisiana and arkansas paving services are exclusively in colorado the company’s heavyside building materials are used in infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction projects aggregates are also used in agricultural utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast the aggregates cement ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the “building materials” business the company also operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio the magnesia specialties business produces magnesiabased chemicals products which are used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel and mining industries magnesia specialties’ products are shipped to customers worldwide 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

the company completed over 85 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace this included an exchange of certain assets in 2011 with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregates quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado and the i25 corridor in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river called the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment 

the business has developed further through the following transactions over the past five years 

in 2013 the company acquired three aggregates quarries in the greater atlanta georgia area the transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregates reserves and enhanced the company’s existing longterm position in this market 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi as a standalone entity was a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states and a major supplier of natural aggregates and ready mixed concrete in texas northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma 

 

and arkansas txi was the largest supplier of cement ready mixed concrete and concrete products in texas txi enhanced the company’s position as an aggregatesled lowcost operator in large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states and provided highquality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in addition to the cement operations the company acquired as part of the txi acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas as part of an agreement in conjunction with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

txi was also a cement producer in california in 2015 the company divested its california cement operations acquired from txi these operations were not in close proximity to aggregates and other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production the divestiture primarily included a cement plant two distribution terminals mobile equipment intangible assets and inventory the company also completed the integration of the txi operations in 2015 and completed three smaller acquisitions which included three aggregates operations and related assets 

in 2016 the company acquired aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations in southern colorado that provided more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expanded the company’s presence along the front range of the rocky mountains home to 80 of colorado’s population the company also acquired the remaining interest it had not previously owned in a ready mixed concrete company that serves the i35 corridor in central texas between dallas and austin which enhanced the company’s position and provided additional vertical integration benefits with the company’s cement product line 

between 2001 and 2017 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates ready mixed concrete trucking and asphalt and road paving operations of its building materials business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2015 the company disposed of certain noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas and divested its california cement operations the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets if appropriate during 2018 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

on june 26 2017 the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire bluegrass materials company “bluegrass materials” for 1625 billion in cash the company will not acquire any of bluegrass materials’ cash and cash equivalents nor will it assume any of bluegrass materials’ outstanding debt bluegrass materials is the largest privately held pureplay aggregates business in the united states and has a portfolio of 23 active sites with more than 125 years of strategicallylocated highquality reserves in maryland georgia south carolina kentucky tennessee and pennsylvania these operations complement the company’s existing southeastern footprint and provide a new growth platform within the southern portion of the northeast megaregion the company and bluegrass materials are continuing to work closely and cooperatively with the department of justice in its review of the proposed transaction the parties currently anticipate that the proposed acquisition will be completed in the first half of 2018 

 

business segment information 

the company conducts its building materials business through three reportable segments organized by geography midamerica group southeast group and west group the midamerica and southeast groups provide aggregates products only the west group provides aggregates cement and downstream products the following states accounted for 74 of the building materials business net sales in 2017 texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2017 consolidated financial statements the “2017 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2017 annual report to shareholders the “2017 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

building materials business 

this section describes the product lines of the building materials business undertaken by the company within its midamerica group southeast group and west group the company undertakes its aggregates product line of business in all of these geographic segments within its building materials business in 2017 the aggregates product line represented 59 of the company’s consolidated total revenues the company’s cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are conducted within the company’s west group with its two cement plants in texas and the remaining ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines in texas colorado louisiana and arkansas paving services are exclusively in colorado the company’s cement product line is described below and in greater detail in the next section collectively in 2017 the building materials business generated total revenues and earnings from operations of 37 billion and 707 million respectively 

the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace the business’ profitability is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending which are in turn affected by fluctuations in interest rates access to capital markets levels of publicsector infrastructure funding and demographic geographic employment and population dynamics the heavy side construction business inclusive of much of the company’s operations is conducted outdoors therefore precipitation and other weatherrelated conditions including flooding hurricanes snowstorms and droughts can significantly affect production schedules shipments costs efficiencies and profitability generally the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are significantly lower than the second and third quarters due to winter weather 

aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone sand and gravel of varying mineralogies manufactured to specific sizes grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications the company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries however the company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states with14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group on average the company’s aggregates reserves exceed 60 years based on normalized production levels and approximate 100 years at current production rates 

cement is the basic binding agent used to bind water aggregates and sand in the production of ready mixed concrete the company has a strategic and leading cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and hunter texas north of san antonio these plants 

 

produce portland and specialty cements have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons and operated at 75 to 80 utilization in 2017 the midlothian plant permit would allow the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons in addition to the two production facilities the company operates several cement distribution terminals calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants 

ready mixed concrete a mixture primarily of cement water aggregates and sand is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site the aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines such as dirt and clay the company owns 143 ready mix operations in texas colorado louisiana and arkansas asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt the binding medium and aggregates similar to ready mixed concrete each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications the company’s asphalt operations are located primarily in colorado additionally paving services are offered in colorado market dynamics for these product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement 

the building materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 40 of the aggregates product line shipments in 2017 made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states therefore these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments however after uncertainty regarding the status of the highway bill in 2014 the company experienced a slight retraction in aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure enduse market consistent with this trend the infrastructure market accounted for a lower percentage of the company’s aggregates product line shipments for the past three years compared with the most recent fiveyear average of 43 

as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates product line shipments increased in each of the three years prior to 2017 including a 14 increase in 2016 reflecting degrees of stability and modest growth this trend reversed however in 2017 as the company’s aggregates product line shipments declined 06 reflecting continuing uncertainty about federal infrastructure spending labor constraints and project delays despite some volume growth in recent years aggregates volumes are still below historically normal levels prior to 2011 the economic recession resulted in united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates product line shipments had also suffered as states continued to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues however most state budgets began to improve starting in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve or begin to resolve budget deficits 

 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions since the expiration of the prior federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century “map21” the fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america’s surface transportation act the “fast act” or the “act” was signed into law on december 4 2015 the fast act reauthorizes federal highway and public transportation programs and stabilizes the highway trust fund the fast act retains the programs supported under the predecessor bill map21 but with some changes specifically transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” a us department of transportation “dot” alternative funding mechanism which under map21 provided three types of federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects now allows more diversification of projects tifia is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private coinvestment by providing projects with supplemental or subordinate debt that is not subject to national debt ceiling challenges or sequestration since inception tifia has provided more than 25 billion of credit assistance to over 50 projects representing over 90 billion in infrastructure investment under the fast act tifia annual funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state dots consequently states can advance construction projects immediately with potentially zero upfront outlay of local state dot dollars tifia requires projects to have a revenue source to pay back the credit assistance within a 30 to 40 year period moreover tifia funds may represent up to 49 of total eligible project costs for a tifiasecured loan and 33 for a tifia standby line of credit therefore the tifia program has the ability to significantly leverage construction dollars each dollar of federal funds can provide up to 10 in tifia credit assistance and support up to 30 in transportation infrastructure investment private investment in transportation projects funded through the tifia program is particularly attractive in part due to the subordination of public investment to private management believes tifia could provide a substantial boost for state dot construction programs well above what is currently budgeted as of january 2018 tifia funded projects for the company’s top five salesgenerating states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia exceeded 25 billion 

public infrastructure activity has not yet experienced the anticipated benefits from funding provided by the fast act and the tifia program state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding specifically in the november 2017 election 37 billion of transportation funding initiatives were approved in texas colorado georgia south carolina and kansas the pace of construction should accelerate and shipments to the public infrastructure market should return to historical levels as monies from both the federal government and state and local governments become available a return to historical levels is also predicated on state dots and contractors addressing their labor constraints 

the federal highway bill provides spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans according to the federal highway administration every 1 billion in federal highway investment creates approximately 28000 jobs the number of jobs created is dependent on the nature and aggregates intensity of the projects approximately half of the building materials business’ net sales to the infrastructure market come from federal funding 

 

authorizations including matching funds from the states for each dollar spent on road highway and bridge improvements the federal highway administration estimates an average benefit of 520 is recognized in the form of reduced vehicle maintenance costs reduced delays reduced fuel consumption improved safety reduced road and bridge maintenance costs and reduced emissions as a result of improved traffic flow 

the company’s building materials business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest salesgenerating states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia accounted for 74 of total 2017 net sales by state of destination the company’s building materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s building materials business 

climate change is defined as a change in global or regional climate patterns changes to the climate have been occurring for centuries due to minor shifts in the earth’s orbit ultimately changing the amount of solar energy received more recently however this rate of change has accelerated and climate change is considered a leading cause of erratic weather production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity most of which occurs outdoors and as a result is affected by erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weatherrelated conditions which can significantly affect the business 

excessive rainfall jeopardizes production shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company in particular the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october nationally 2017 marked the 20th wettest year on record and the fifth consecutive year with aboveaverage precipitation the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas in fact 2015 set a new rainfall record for texas the 24month period ending september 2016 set a new twoyear record for the state with an average annual rainfall of 75 inches hurricane harvey a category 4 storm that made landfall in houston in august 2017 brought nearly 20 trillion gallons of precipitation in the southeast hurricane irma also a category 4 storm made landfall in florida in september 2017 and brought excessive rainfall to the southeastern united states notably florida and georgia additionally in 2017 colorado experienced its fifteenth wettest ninemonths for the period january through september in october 2016 rainfall along the eastern seaboard of the united states from hurricane matthew a category 5 hurricane approximated 136 trillion gallons hurricane matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the bahamas 

noaa reports that since 1895 the contiguous united states has experienced an average temperature increase of 15°f per century with 2017 averaging 26°f above the 20th century average and marking it the third warmest year on record behind 2012 and 2016 in fact 2017 marked the 21st consecutive warmerthanaverage year for the contiguous united states and five states including north carolina and south carolina had a record warmest year temperature plays a significant role in the months of march and november meaningfully affecting the first and fourthquarter results respectively warm andor moderate temperatures in march and november allows the construction season to start earlier and end later respectively in 2017 the nation experienced the ninth warmest march on record while colorado and texas reported its warmest and its second warmest march respectively the weather was also favorable in november 2017 as colorado set another record and texas reported its fifth warmest november 

 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the permile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

product shipments are moved by rail and water through the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s rail network primarily serves its texas florida and gulf coast markets while the company’s bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships the company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material at december 31 2017 the company had 81 distribution yards in 2017 241 million tons of aggregates were sold from distribution yards the longhaul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in longhaul transportation of their aggregates products particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail andor water to be sold in other markets the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location 

the company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregates mines the company operates 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries 

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to move material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margin this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance 

 

including track congestion crew availability railcar availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including among other items meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts for shipment by water are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options however there can be no assurance that these contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it is still obligated to pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2017 the company did not incur these freight costs however a charge is possible in 2018 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing demands for rail service 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southwest and southeast coastal markets 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy recovered from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

 

the company became more vertically integrated through various acquisitions including the 2014 txi acquisition in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired cement ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving construction operations trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations the company reports verticallyintegrated operations within the building materials business segment and their results are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2017 prices for liquid asphalt were slightly higher than 2016 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products we expect the company’s gross margin to continue to improve for the legacy txi aggregatesrelated downstream operations similar to the pattern experienced at the colorado aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

while aggregatesled the company continues to review its operational portfolio to determine if there are opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent building materials operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own independent operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the 2014 business combination with txi described under general above further expanded the company’s downstream operations with the addition of txi’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations the txi combination also added the cement operations included in the west group as the cement product line of the company the 2016 transactions described under general above further added ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations along the front range in colorado and ready mixed concrete operations in central texas 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates product line’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates product line the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells its aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

 

less than 1 of the total revenues from the building materials business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with total revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 107 million 122 million and 130 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

cement product line 

the cement product line of the building materials business produces portland and specialty cements cement is the basic binding agent for concrete a primary construction material the principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in texas similar to aggregates cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector 

the company has a strategic cement position in texas with production facilities in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and in hunter texas north of san antonio these plants have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons as well as a current permit that would allow the company to expand production by up to 800000 additional tons at the midlothian plant in addition to these production facilities the company also operates directly or through third parties five cement distribution terminals in texas 

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october approximately 70 of all cement shipments are sent to readymix concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concrete related products contractors materials dealers oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities 

energy including electricity and fossil fuels accounted for approximately 22 of the cement production cost profile in 2017 therefore profitability of the cement product line is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance this process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2017 and 2016 the cement product line incurred ordinary kiln maintenance shutdown costs of 126 million and 209 million respectively 

the cement product line is benefitting from continued strength in the texas markets where current demand exceeds local supply a trend that is expected to continue for the near future the company shipped a total of 35 million tons of cement in 2017 with 23 million tons shipped to external customers in five states and 12 million tons consumed by the company internally in the company’s ready mixed concrete product line cement shipments in the last two years were negatively affected by significant amounts of rain in texas for 2017 the cement product line generated total revenues and earnings from operations of 384 million and 123 million respectively 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

 

the cement product line generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

from time to time a small percentage of the company’s cement sales may be to customers located outside the united states the company however had no such sales during the last three years 

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville ohio facility additionally at its manistee michigan facility magnesia specialties manufactures magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2017 71 of magnesia specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products 28 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials for 2017 the magnesia specialties business generated record total revenues and earnings from operations of 270 million and 79 million respectively 

in 2017 82 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 18 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 37 of the magnesia specialties’ total revenues in 2017 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 74 in 2017 according to the american iron and steel institute average steel production in 2017 increased 43 versus 2016 

in the magnesia specialties business a significant portion of costs related to the production of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemical products is of a fixed or semifixed nature the production process requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke therefore fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results to help mitigate this risk the magnesia specialties business has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2018 coal needs approximately 33 of its 2018 natural gas needs and 100 of its 2018 petroleum coke needs for 2017 the company’s average cost per mcf thousand cubic feet for natural gas increased 33 over 2016 

given high fixed costs low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations management expects future organic growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that product line is not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line 

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with magnesia specialties 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln completed in 2012 at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia risk factors of this form 10k 

the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2017 were predominantly from north america but a small amount was derived from overseas no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the total revenues of the company total revenues from customers in foreign countries were 535 million 449 million and 327 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business’ sales are predominately denominated in the united states dollar however the current strength of the united states dollar in foreign markets is negatively affecting the overall price of magnesia specialties’ products when compared with foreigndomiciled competitors 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 9 2018 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 22 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 98 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates product line tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5500 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with approximately 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are approximately 3700 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company with its building materials business including its ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the building materials industry 

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products while the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2017 were predominantly from north america a small amount was derived from customers located outside the united states 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 107 cement plants in 36 states the top five companies collectively operate 496 of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 142 of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 767 of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states in reviewing these figures for cement plants capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity “clinker” is the initial product of cement production cement producers mine materials such as limestone shale or other materials crush and screen the materials and place them in a cement kiln after being heated to extremely high temperatures these materials form marblesized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement 

the company’s cement product line competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement product line also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets certain of the company’s competitors in the cement product line have greater financial resources than the company 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from stone quarries or mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are typically large verticallyintegrated companies with international operations ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some 

 

markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large verticallyintegrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 234 million in 2017 and approximately 215 million in 2016 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 20 million in 2017 and are expected to be approximately 20 million in 2018 and 2019 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2017 and 2016 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar 

 

that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2017 financial statements and the 2017 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2017 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2017 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2017 annual report however 

 

future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry mining and production facilities for cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites and production facilities are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines and production facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with others in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the magnesia specialties dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program it anticipates that it will reach a settlement of this matter with the usepa the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and that those costs and any related penalties will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

 

in october 2014 the company received a caa section 114 request for information regarding the manistee michigan operations from the usepa similar to the one initially received at the woodville ohio plant the letter seeks information regarding the company’s compliance with the nsr program at the magnesia specialties manufacturing plant in manistee michigan no notices of violation have been received by the company relating to alleged noncompliance at the manistee plant the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program and has submitted information to the usepa for review and is awaiting a response or additional questions the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the costs if any that may be incurred relating to this matter 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases “ghg” or “ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule in may 2010 the usepa issued a final rule known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule that would have required the company to incorporate best available ghg control technology in any new plant that it might propose to build and in its existing plants if it modified them in a manner that would increase ghg emissions in the company’s case principally carbon dioxide emissions by more than 75000 tons per year this rule was challenged in court by various public and private parties and was upheld in part and invalidated in part by the united states supreme court in an opinion issued in june 2014 the court concluded that the usepa may in fact require best available control technology for ghg but only if the plant is otherwise subject to prevention of significant deterioration or title v air permitting under the usepa’s rules it is not known whether the usepa will revise its rules in response to the court’s decision and if so what the impact will be on the company’s operations no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs such as carbon dioxide have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency and it is not known what the usepa will require as best available control technology for plants or conditions it will require for operating permits in the event of modifications to plants or construction of new plants 

in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach capandtrade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority it is not known whether this will be a priority of the usepa during president trump’s administration various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregates operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the magnesia specialties operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 

 

cement production worldwide is estimated to comprise approximately 5 to 10 of co 2 or ghg emissions and the usepa has indicated that co 2 emitted from cement production is the second largest source of co 2 emissions in the united states the company has two cement plants during 2016 the company through its txi subsidiary filed annual reports of the ghg emissions relating to its two cement operations in texas 

if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations as well as the company’s two cement operations will likely be subject to the new program in addition any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact the company’s woodville manistee and cement operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement operations would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also continuing to review the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or building materials businesses 

in 2010 the usepa issued rules that dramatically reduced the permitted emissions of mercury total hydrocarbons particulate matter and hydrochloric acid from cement plants the compliance date for these new standards was september 2015 but the usepa granted various extensions to verify monitoring systems are effective for mercury and hydrogen chloride emissions the company has conducted tests to analyze the current level of compliance of its cement plants with the new standards all plants required the installation of continuous emissions monitoring “cems” the company through its subsidiary txi identified and installed new control and monitoring equipment for these purposes and believes that the cement plants meet the emission requirements in these rules the company does not believe that the costs relating to these controls and equipment will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the company or the cement product line 

employees 

as of january 31 2018 the company has approximately 8406 employees of which 6344 are hourly employees and 2062 are salaried employees included among these employees are 912 hourly employees represented by labor unions 109 of the company’s employees of such amount 105 of our building materials business’ hourly employees are members of a labor union and 100 of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts for the magnesia specialties business cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in may 2018 the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2019 the company believes it has good relations with all of its employees including its unionized employees while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales generating states from timetotime stop or slow bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregates products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the great recession was an example and our business suffered construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

 

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our building materials business based on net sales by state of destination of texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the great recession 

the great recession of 2008 resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry recent years however have shown a slow turnaround in this trend the united states is currently experiencing the thirdlongest economic recovery since the great depression as of december 31 2017 the current expansion which started in june 2009 the approximate end of the great recession has lasted 102 months by comparison the average troughtopeak expansionary cycle since 1938 was 60 months and in may 2018 the current cycle will become the secondlongest economic recovery since the great depression during this current economic expansion however governmental uncertainty labor shortages and record levels of precipitation have slowed the pace of heavy construction activity resulting in what we believe to be a slow steady extended construction cycle the company’s overall aggregates product line shipments remain approximately 10 below midcycle demand importantly the level of recovery varies within the company’s geographic footprint specifically north carolina and georgia key states in the midamerica and southeast groups respectively are approximately 20 below midcycle demand while texas a key state in the west group is modestly above midcycle demand during 2017 our aggregates product line shipments showed a 06 decline compared with 2016 levels after a 14 increase in 2016 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the solvency of the federal highway bill in 2014 contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of a new federal highway bill which has had insignificant impact at the federal level to date this time lag with commencement of federal infrastructure funding was accompanied by a reduction in some states’ investment in highway maintenance 

the public infrastructure market accounted for approximately 40 of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2017 consistent with 2016 and 2015 government uncertainty attendant project delays and tight labor markets have exerted disproportionate downward pressure on public construction activity and for the past three years as these headwinds have worsened the company’s shipments to this end use market have remained below the most recent fiveyear average of 43 and tenyear average of 48 our aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market increased 2 in 2017 compared with 2016 

the nonresidential construction market accounted for approximately 31 of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2017 our aggregates shipments to the nonresidential construction market decreased 3 in 2017 compared with 2016 according to the us census bureau spending for the private nonresidential construction market increased in 2017 compared with 2016 the dodge momentum index dmi a twelvemonth leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgrawhill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 remained strong at a nineyear high of 1539 in december 2017 a 21 increase over prior year historically half of the company’s nonresidential construction shipments have been used for office and retail projects while the remainder has been used for heavy industrial and capacityrelated projects including energyrelated projects since the latter part of 2015 low oil prices have suppressed shipments directly into shale exploration activities in 2017 the company shipped approximately 18 million tons for shale exploration compared with approximately 15 million tons in 2016 and 36 million tons in 2015 

 

the residential construction market accounted for approximately 21 of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2017 our aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 1 in 2017 compared with 2016 private residential construction spending increased 12 in 2017 compared with 2016 according to the us census bureau the residential construction market like the nonresidential construction market is interest ratesensitive and typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles the company’s exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions including roads sidewalks and storm and sewage drainage aggregates used in new singlefamily home construction and aggregates used in construction of multifamily units construction of both subdivisions and singlefamily homes is more aggregates intensive than construction of multifamily units through an economic cycle multifamily construction generally begins early in the cycle and then transitions to singlefamily construction therefore the timing of new subdivision starts as well as new singlefamily housing permits are strong indicators of residential volumes while residential housing starts were approximately 13 million units in 2017 they still remain below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units 

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates and cement products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified near the end of 2015 with the passage of the current federal highway bill the fast act which reauthorizes federal highway and transportation funding programs the fast act also changes the transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects under the fast act tifia funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state dots while the total value of united states overall publicworks spending increased in 2017 federal funding through the fast act did not impact highway spending in any meaningful way this increase in overall public works spending in 2017 demonstrates the commitment of states to address the underlying demand for infrastructure investment we expect to see some increased infrastructure spending at the state level in 2018 but no meaningful impact from the fast act funding or an enhanced federal infrastructure bill until 2019 or later any enhanced federal infrastructure bill will require congressional approval we cannot be assured however of such approval or of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states after the great recession experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects for example north carolina was among the states that experienced these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina improved in 2014 and later years as increased tax revenues helped resolve budget deficits 

during the past 36 months many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes in the november 2017 election 37 billion of transportation funding initiatives were approved in texas colorado georgia south carolina and kansas we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

with most states in recovery or expansion the sustained decline in energy costs may be the catalyst in some markets to boost construction and help our business but those markets that are heavily dependent on the energy sector namely oklahoma and west virginia may with the decrease in oil production experience recessions or continued recessions which would adversely impact our business 

our building materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather which can significantly impact operations 

since the heavyside construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the building materials product lines’ production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s building materials business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated over the last two years by record precipitation in many of our key markets nationally 2017 marked the 20th wettest year on record and the fifth consecutive year with aboveaverage precipitation the last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the united states and particularly to texas importantly inclement weather was most significant during the second and third quarters which represents the zenith of the construction season for the sixmonth period from april through september for the 123 years the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa has been tracking data most areas experienced aboveaverage rainfall these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in 2017 and 2016 so our results for those years or in comparison to other years may not be indicative of our future operating results 

 

the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in texas hurricane harvey a category 4 storm that made landfall in houston in august 2017 brought nearly 20 trillion gallons of precipitation in the southeast hurricane irma also a category 4 storm made landfall in florida in september 2017 and brought excessive rainfall to the southeastern united states notably florida and georgia in october 2016 rainfall along the eastern seaboard of the united states from hurricane matthew a category5 hurricane approximated 136 trillion gallons hurricane matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the bahamas where the company has a facility these hurricanes generated winds rainfall and flooding which disrupted operations in texas louisiana florida georgia the carolinas and the bahamas 

our building materials business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving product lines may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement product line may compete with international competitors who are importing product to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

 

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates 

as discussed previously our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

for example demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates in 2017 the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate to over one percent for the first time in nearly a decade the residential construction market accounted for 21 of our aggregates product line shipments in 2017 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results historically our profitability increased during period of rising interest rates in essence our underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our acquisition of txi in 2014 and our pending acquisition of bluegrass materials in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition excluding bluegrass materials with shares of our common stock for example we used our common stock in our acquisition of txi we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing longterm shareholder return 

we cannot be assured our proposed acquisition of bluegrass materials will be completed or will be completed in the timeframe or on the terms or in the manner we currently anticipate 

there are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to our proposed acquisition of bluegrass materials for example the acquisition may not be completed or may not be completed in the timeframe on the terms or in the manner we currently anticipate as a result of a number of factors including the failure of one or more of the conditions to closing the proposed acquisition we cannot be assured the conditions to closing the proposed acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the acquisition the acquisition agreement may be terminated by the parties under certain circumstances any delay in closing or a failure to close could have a negative impact on our business and the trading prices of our securities 

 

we and bluegrass materials will be subject to business uncertainties while the proposed acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our and their business 

uncertainty about the effect of the proposed acquisition of bluegrass materials on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us and bluegrass materials although we and bluegrass materials intend to take actions to reduce any adverse effects these uncertainties may impair our and their ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the proposed acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter these uncertainties could cause customers suppliers and others that transact business with us andor bluegrass materials to seek to change existing business relationships in addition employee retention could be reduced during the pendency of the proposed acquisition as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles if despite our and bluegrass materials’ retention efforts key employees depart because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process or a desire not to remain with us our business could be harmed 

before the proposed acquisition may be completed the applicable waiting period must expire or terminate under federal law and we may be required to divest certain assets in order to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in addition to this regulatory approval the proposed acquisition is subject to certain other conditions that may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the transaction we cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied the requirements for satisfying such conditions could delay completion of the proposed acquisition of bluegrass materials for a period of time reducing or eliminating some anticipated benefits of the transaction or prevent completion of the acquisition from occurring at all 

our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected 

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations our largest business acquisition has been our business combination with txi which closed in july 2014 in 2015 we completed the integration of txi’s operations into our own operations ahead of schedule which allowed us to achieve and exceed the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we had forecasted from the txi acquisition however in connection with the integration of any business that we may acquire including our proposed acquisition of bluegrass materials it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we have forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to do similar to the acquisition of txi or bluegrass materials would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we might choose to pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving businesses typically provide lower profit margins than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore as we expand these operations our overall gross margin is likely to be adversely affected our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 127 for 2017 and 131 for 2016 the overall gross margin of our building materials business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies including explosives conveyor belting and tires while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk our last fixedprice commitment for a portion of our diesel fuel requirements expired at the end of 2016 

to illustrate how diesel fuel price fluctuations and other energy costs have impacted our business consider the recent years in 2013 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4 lower than we paid in 2012 but the average cost of natural gas was 18 higher than 2012 similarly in 2014 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 8 lower compared to 2013 but the average cost of natural gas increased 24 from 2013 diesel fuel which averaged 282 per gallon in 2014 and 298 per gallon in 2013 represents the single largest component of energy costs for our aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines diesel fuel prices declined rapidly during december 2014 ending the year at a per 

 

gallon price that was 26 below the 2014 average this trend continued in 2015 as the company’s average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2015 was 205 compared with 302 in 2014 natural gas costs also declined in 2015 down 28 from the 2014 average cost these trends continued in 2016 and 2017 for diesel fuel prices average diesel fuel prices per gallon fell to 181 in 2017 compared to 196 in 2016 which compared with 205 in 2015 our average diesel fuel prices for 2015 and 2016 were higher than spot market prices by 030 per gallon since we purchased approximately 40 of our diesel fuel under a fixed price fuel agreement which has expired that had locked in a higher price at an earlier time natural gas costs increased in 2017 approximately 33 from 2016 levels which had declined in 2016 down 25 from the 2015 average cost 

the company has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2018 coal needs approximately 33 of its 2018 natural gas needs and 100 of its 2018 petroleum coke needs 

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 22 of the 2017 direct production costs of our cement product line therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement product line profitability of the cement product line is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 126 and 209 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively 

similarly our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we can produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials for 2014 we saw higher prices for these raw materials than 2013 this trend reversed in 2015 when we saw lower prices for these raw materials than 2014 liquid asphalt prices in 2016 were again lower than in 2015 the trend reversed itself again in 2017 when liquid asphalt prices were slightly higher than in 2016 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility 

cement is a commodity and competition is often based mainly on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally fall we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line 

 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2017 the cement product line incurred shutdown costs of 126 million during the year in 2017 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 51 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time 

our cement product line and magnesia specialties business may become capacity constrained 

if our cement product line or magnesia specialties business becomes capacity constrained they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity constrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize

our cement product line could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws 

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement product line 

our paving operations present additional risks to our business 

our paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our paving operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 105 of the hourly employees of our building materials business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2019 and may 2018 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2017 financial statements 

reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels until the recent enactment of a new federal highway bill further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities like we did with the acquisition of txi in order to maintain our investment grade 

 

credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies located outside the united states therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar in 2017 the strength of the us dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the magnesia specialties business when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

 additionally the occurrence of certain changeofcontrol events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

increases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

 

the 2017 tax act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 included a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21 in accordance with us generally accepted accounting practices we performed a provisional remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate as of december 31 2017 which resulted in a onetime noncash income tax benefit to us of 2581 million we recorded this income tax benefit on a provisional basis subject to adjustment as described below 

in december 2017 the sec issued guidance to address the application of authoritative tax accounting guidance in situations where companies do not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act for the reporting period in which the 2017 tax act was enacted in these instances the sec’s guidance allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we have recorded the provisional tax benefit in our 2017 consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of the 2017 tax act as we have yet to complete our analysis of the impact any adjustment to this provisional amount as we complete our analysis could have a material impact on our 2018 results of operations 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

 item 2 properties tableend building materials business 

as of december 31 2017 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 282 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 26 states canada and the bahamas of which 108 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 59 are on land owned in part and leased in part 107 are on leased land and eight are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and approximate 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2017 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 152 properties in five states of which 127 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances one is on land owned in part and leased in part and 24 are on leased land 

 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement product line as it does for its aggregates product line for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2017 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last three years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last two years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful the company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the company’s cement product line and magnesia specialties business 

 

  

     

  

 cement product line 

as of december 31 2017 the company through its subsidiaries processed or shipped cement from six properties in one state of which four are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and two are on leased land the company’s cement product line has production facilities located at two sites in texas midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth hunter texas north of san antonio the following table summarizes certain information about the company’s cement manufacturing facilities at december 31 2017 

 

 reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2844 acres of land owned by the company as of december 31 2017 the company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 692 million tons 

the company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns crushers preheaterscalciners coolers finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries these cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck 

as of december 31 2017 the company through its subsidiaries also operated directly or through third parties five cement distribution terminals and owned the real estate at the california cement grinding and packaging facility it sold on september 30 2015 which it expects to sell for noncement use 

 

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its five reportable business segments 

condition and utilization 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

during 2017 the principal properties of the aggregates product line were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however during the great recession the company adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2017 the company’s aggregates product line operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 365 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idling could continue the company expects however as the economy continues to recover it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 

during 2017 the texas cement plants operated on average at 75 to 80 utilization the portland cement association “pca” forecasts a 26 increase in demand in texas in 2018 over 2017 the cement product line’s leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency due to the 247365 nature of cement operations significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

the company expects future organic earnings growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70 and the strength of the united states dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment the dolomitic lime business of the magnesia specialties segment operated at 71 utilization in 2017

 item 1 business tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading supplier of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel used for the construction of infrastructure nonresidential and residential projects aggregates products are also used for railroad ballast and in agricultural utility and environmental applications the company’s aggregates business consists primarily of mining processing and selling granite limestone sand and gravel the aggregates business also includes aggregatesrelated downstream product lines including its heavy building materials such as asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving construction services the company is also a leading supplier of cement ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving services in some regions where being able to supply a full range of products is important for customer service the company’s cement business produces portland and specialty cements the company also has a magnesia specialties business that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

the company completed over 85 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace this included an exchange of certain assets in 2011 with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregates quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado and the i25 corridor in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river called the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment the company uses its ability to distribute materials over long distances by rail and water to further expand its operations 

the business has developed further through the following transactions over the past five years 

in 2013 the company acquired three aggregates quarries in the greater atlanta georgia area the transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced the company’s existing longterm position in this market 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi as a standalone entity was a 

 

leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states and a major supplier of natural aggregates and ready mixed concrete in texas northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma and arkansas txi was the largest supplier of ready mixed concrete concrete products and cement in texas txi enhanced the company’s position as an aggregatesled lowcost operator in the large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states and provided highquality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in addition to the cement business the company acquired as part of the txi acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas as part of an agreement with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested of its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

txi was also a cement producer in california in 2015 the company divested its california cement business acquired from txi these operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production the divestiture primarily included a cement plant two distribution terminals mobile equipment intangible assets and inventory the company also completed the integration of the txi operations in 2015 and completed three smaller acquisitions which included three aggregates operations and related assets 

in 2016 the company acquired aggregates ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations in southern colorado that provided more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expanded the company’s presence along the front range of the rocky mountains home to 80 of colorado’s population the company also acquired the remaining interest it had not previously owned in a ready mixed concrete company that serves the i35 corridor in central texas between dallas and austin which enhanced the company’s position and provided additional vertical integration benefits with the company’s cement business 

between 2001 and 2016 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates ready mixed concrete trucking and asphalt and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2015 the company disposed of certain noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas and divested its california cement operations of its cement business the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets if appropriate during 2017 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company conducts its aggregates business through three reportable segments the midamerica group southeast group and west group the company’s cement business is reported through the cement segment the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each 

 

reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2016 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2016 consolidated financial statements the “2016 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2016 annual report to shareholders the “2016 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include ready mixed concrete and asphalt and road paving operations in arkansas colorado louisiana texas and wyoming 

the company is a leading supplier of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2016 the company’s aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete from a network of nearly 300 quarries underground mines and distribution facilities and approximately 150 ready mixed concrete plants to customers in 29 states canada and the bahamas generating net sales and earnings from operations of 31 billion and 5760 million respectively 

the aggregates and cement businesses market their products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 39 of the aggregates product line shipments in 2016 made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states therefore these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects the company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential or privatesector construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sectorrelated shipments however after uncertainty regarding the solvency of the highway bill in 2014 the company experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure enduse market consistent with this trend the infrastructure market accounted for a lower percentage of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2016 and 2015 compared with the most recent fiveyear average of 44 

as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates product line shipments have increased each of the past five years reflecting degrees of stability and modest growth however aggregates volumes are still below historically normal levels prior to 2011 the economic recession resulted in united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments had also suffered as states continued to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget 

 

shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues however most state budgets began to improve starting in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve or begin to resolve budget deficits during 2016 the company’s aggregates shipments increased 14 compared with 2015 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions since the prior federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century “map21” expired the fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america’s surface transportation act the “fast act” or the “act” was signed into law in december 2015 the fast act reauthorizes federal highway and public transportation programs funding for the fast act is primarily secured through gas tax collections and will enable states to purchase and use an estimated additional 114 million tons of aggregates over the life of the act 2074 billion of the fast act funding will be apportioned to the states with a 51 increase over actual fiscal year 2015 apportionments in 2016 and then inflationary increases in subsequent years meaningful impact from the fast act is expected beginning in 2017 although the fast act did not meaningfully impact 2016 highway spending the total value of publicworks spending across the united states increased demonstrating the continued commitment of many states to address underlying demand for infrastructure investment during the past 24 months many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes 

the fast act retains the programs supported under the predecessor bill map21 but with some changes specifically transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” a us department of transportation alternative funding mechanism which under map21 provided three types of federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects now allows more diversification of projects tifia is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private coinvestment by providing projects with supplemental or subordinate debt that is not subject to national debt ceiling challenges or sequestration since inception tifia has provided more than 25 billion of credit assistance to over 50 projects representing over 90 billion in infrastructure investment under the fast act tifia annual funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state departments of transportation consequently states can advance construction projects immediately with potentially zero upfront outlay of local state department of transportation dollars tifia requires projects to have a revenue source to pay back the credit assistance within a 30 to 40 year period moreover tifia funds may represent up to 49 of total eligible project costs for a tifiasecured loan and 33 for a tifia standby line of credit therefore the tifia program has the ability to significantly leverage construction dollars each dollar of federal funds can provide up to 10 in tifia credit assistance and support up to 30 in transportation infrastructure investment private investment in transportation projects funded through the tifia program is particularly attractive in part due to the subordination of public investment to private management believes tifia could provide a substantial boost for state department of transportation construction programs well above what is currently budgeted as of january 2017 tifia funded projects for the company’s key states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia exceeded 22 billion 

the federal highway bill provides spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the 

 

mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans according to the federal highway administration every 1 billion in federal highway investment creates approximately 28000 jobs the number of jobs created is dependent on the nature and aggregates intensity of the projects approximately half of the aggregates business’ net sales to the infrastructure market come from federal funding authorizations including matching funds from the states for each dollar spent on road highway and bridge improvements the federal highway administration estimates an average benefit of 520 is recognized in the form of reduced vehicle maintenance costs reduced delays reduced fuel consumption improved safety reduced road and bridge maintenance costs and reduced emissions as a result of improved traffic flow 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia accounted for 73 of total 2016 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern and midwestern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall flooding or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets subject to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the coastal areas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses from time to time 

weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated over the last two years by record precipitation in many of the company’s key markets net sales production and cost structure were adversely affected by the significant precipitation the national oceanic and atmospheric administration “noaa” has tracked precipitation for 122 years according to noaa 2015 represented the wettest year on record for texas and oklahoma while north carolina south carolina colorado and iowa each experienced a topten precipitation year and the nation as a whole had its thirdwettest year in noaa recorded history in 2016 many areas in the united states again experienced significant amounts of precipitation texas experienced its 18th wettest year in the state’s recorded history per noaa further since march 2015 texas and surrounding regions have experienced 18 major flood events additionally in october 2016 rainfall along the eastern seaboard of the united states from hurricane matthew a category5 hurricane approximated 136 trillion gallons hurricane 

 

matthew was also the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the bahamas where the company has a facility accordingly the company’s financial results for any year and notably 2016 and 2015 or yeartoyear comparisons of reported results may not be indicative of future operating results 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

a significant percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments continue to be moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2016 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 76 by truck 20 by rail and 4 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of deepwater and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group that have certain areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population growth and density employment growth and economic diversity the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in 2016 248 million tons of aggregates were sold from distribution yards 

the company’s medina rock and rail “medina” capital project with a total cost of 160 million was the largest capital expansion project in its history located near san antonio texas medina consists of a railconnected limestone aggregates processing facility which shipped approximately four million tons in 2016 and has the future capability of producing in excess of 10 million tons per year medina became operational in january 2016 

the company also acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregate mines the company operates 14 active underground mines located in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries 

 

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts for shipment by water are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it is still obligated to pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2016 the company incurred 11 million of these charges a similar charge is possible in 2017 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy has begun to recover from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing the company’s presence in its core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated through various acquisitions including the 2014 txi acquisition in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired ready mixed concrete asphalt and paving construction operations trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations the company reports these operations within the aggregates business segment and their results are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2016 prices for liquid asphalt were lower than 2015 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products we expect the company’s gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues to continue to improve for the legacy txi aggregatesrelated downstream operations similar to the pattern experienced at the colorado aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

the company continues to review aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own aggregatesrelated downstream operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments the company completed the acquisitions described under 

 

general above which included aggregatesrelated downstream operations including ready mixed concrete and asphalt and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the 2014 business combination with txi described under general above further expanded the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations with the addition of txi’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations the txi combination also added the cement operations of txi which are accounted for as a separate business segment of the company the 2016 transactions described under general above further added aggregatesrelated downstream operations with the addition of ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving and contracting operations along the front range in colorado and ready mixed concrete operations in central texas 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 1 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 118 million 123 million and 130 million during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

cement business 

the cement business produces portland and specialty cements cement is the basic binding agent for concrete a primary construction material the principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in texas similar to the aggregates business cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector 

the company has the leading cement position in texas with two production facilities one located in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and the other located in hunter texas north of san antonio these plants have a combined annual capacity of 45 million tons as well as a current permit that provides an 800000tonexpansion opportunity at the midlothian plant in addition to these production facilities the company also operates five cement distribution terminals in texas 

 

from july 1 2014 through september 30 2015 the company also operated a cement plant at oro grande california cement grinding and packaging facilities at the crestmore plant near riverside california and two californiabased cement distribution terminals during 2015 the company sold all of its california cement operations it retained the real estate at the crestmore facility which the company expects to sell for noncement use these operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production 

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october the majority of all cement shipments approximately 70 percent are sent to readymix concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concrete related products contractors materials dealers oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities 

energy including electricity and fossil fuels accounted for approximately 22 of the cement production cost profile in 2016 therefore profitability of the cement business is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance this process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2016 the cement business incurred ordinary kiln maintenance shutdown costs of 209 million 

the cement business is benefitting from continued strength in the texas markets where current demand exceeds local supply a trend that is expected to continue for the near future the company shipped a total of 35 million tons of cement in 2016 with 23 million tons shipped to external customers in five states and 12 million tons consumed by the company for internal use a portion of the cement is used internally in the company’s ready mixed concrete product line for 2016 the cement business generated net sales and earnings from operations of 3644 million and 994 million respectively 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

the cement business generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there are no significant levels of order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

from time to time a small percentage of the company’s cement sales are to customers located outside the united states the company had no such sales in 2016 since the company sold the california cement operations in 2015 previously such sales were less than 2 of revenues for the cement business coming from sales from california to customers in mexico with revenues from such customers totaling 04 million during 2015 and 38 million during 2014 for the period from the july 1 2014 acquisition of txi 

 

magnesia specialties business 

the company manufactures and markets through its magnesia specialties business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2016 69 of magnesia specialties’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 30 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials for 2016 the magnesia specialties business generated record net sales and earnings from operations of 2380 million and 791 million respectively 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business the company has sought to mitigate certain of these fluctuations and risks by entering into fixedprice supply contracts for certain fuels including natural gas coal and petroleum coke 

in 2016 83 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 17 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 41 of the magnesia specialties’ net sales in 2016 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the revenues and profitability of the magnesia specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 71 in 2016 according to the american iron and steel institute average steel production in 2016 declined 05 versus 2015 declining steel utilization and united states dollar strength could adversely affect magnesia specialties’ operating results 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that product line is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business 

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia 

 

specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with magnesia specialties 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln completed in 2012 at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia risk factors of this form 10k 

approximately 18 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2016 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 430 million 327 million and 290 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business’ sales are predominately denominated in the united states dollar however the current strength of the united states dollar in foreign markets is negatively affecting the overall price of magnesia specialties’ products when compared with foreigndomiciled competitors 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 10 2017 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 23 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 104 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5500 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations are also characterized by numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with about 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are about 3700 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company in its aggregates business including its aggregatesrelated downstream operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates industry 

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for 18 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2016 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 107 cement plants in 36 states the top five companies collectively operate 496 of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 142 of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 767 of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states in reviewing these figures for cement plants capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity “clinker” is the initial product of cement production cement producers mine materials such as limestone shale or other materials crush and screen the materials and place them in a cement kiln after being heated to extremely high temperatures these materials form marblesized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement 

the company’s cement business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement business also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets certain of the company’s competitors in the cement business have greater financial resources than the company 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from stone quarries or 

 

mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are typically large vertically integrated companies with international operations ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks accordingly economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some markets as a result depending on the local market the company may face competition from small producers as well as large vertically integrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 215 million in 2016 and approximately 247 million in 2015 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 87 million in 2016 and are expected to be approximately 90 million in 2017 and 2018 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2016 and 2015 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and 

 

are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2016 financial statements and the 2016 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation 

 

requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2016 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2016 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2016 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry mining and production facilities for asphalt cement and ready mixed concrete must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites and production facilities are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries mines and production facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with other companies in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much 

 

of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the magnesia specialties dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the magnesia specialties segment of the business 

in october 2014 the company received a caa section 114 request for information regarding the manistee michigan operations from the usepa similar to the one initially received at the woodville ohio plant the letter seeks information regarding the company’s compliance with the nsr program at the magnesia specialties manufacturing plant in manistee michigan no notices of violation have been received by the company relating to alleged noncompliance at the manistee plant the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program and has submitted information to the usepa for review and is awaiting a response or additional questions the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the costs if any that may be incurred relating to this matter 

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties “prps” under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities not designated prps including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site this group was later expanded to over 200 potential prps in 2016 a global settlement was reached for past costs and cleanup of the contamination which the company joined for a payment of 102000 to the usepa and 12 million to the prps a group of which will be conducting the cleanup process 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases “ghg” or “ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule in may 2010 the 

 

usepa issued a final rule known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule that would have required the company to incorporate best available ghg control technology in any new plant that it might propose to build and in its existing plants if it modified them in a manner that would increase ghg emissions in the company’s case principally carbon dioxide emissions by more than 75000 tons per year this rule was challenged in court by various public and private parties and was upheld in part and invalidated in part by the united states supreme court in an opinion issued in june 2014 the court concluded that the usepa may in fact require best available control technology for ghg but only if the plant is otherwise subject to prevention of significant deterioration or title v air permitting under the usepa’s rules it is not known whether the usepa will revise its rules in response to the court’s decision and if so what the impact will be on the company’s operations no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs such as carbon dioxide have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency and it is not known what the usepa will require as best available control technology for plants or conditions it will require for operating permits in the event of modifications to plants or construction of new plants 

in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach capandtrade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority it is not known whether this will be a priority of the usepa during president trump’s administration various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregates operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the magnesia specialties operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 

cement production worldwide is estimated to comprise approximately 5 to 10 of co 2 or ghg emissions and the usepa has indicated that co 2 emitted from cement production is the second largest source of co 2 emissions in the united states the company has two cement plants during 2016 the company through its txi subsidiary filed annual reports of the ghg emissions relating to its two cement operations in texas 

if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations as well as the company’s two cement operations will likely be subject to the new program in addition any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs imposed by the usepa will likely impact the company’s woodville manistee and cement operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or 

 

taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville or cement operations would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also continuing to review the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or cement businesses 

in 2010 the usepa issued rules that dramatically reduced the permitted emissions of mercury total hydrocarbons particulate matter and hydrochloric acid from cement plants the compliance date for these new standards was september 2015 but the usepa granted various extensions to verify monitoring systems are effective for mercury and hydrogen chloride emissions the company has conducted tests to analyze the current level of compliance of its cement plants with the new standards all plants required the installation of continuous emissions monitoring “cems” the company through its subsidiary txi identified and installed new control and monitoring equipment for these purposes and believes that the cement plants meet the emission requirements in these rules the company does not believe that the costs relating to these controls and equipment will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the company or the cement business 

employees 

as of january 31 2017 the company has approximately 8111 employees of which 6189 are hourly employees and 1922 are salaried employees included among these employees are 860 hourly employees represented by labor unions 106 of the company’s employees of such amount 99 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union none of the company’s cement business’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions and 100 of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts for the magnesia specialties business cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in may 2018 the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2019 the company believes it has good relations with all of its employees including its unionized employees while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales generating states from timetotime stop or slow bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregates products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the great recession was an example and our business suffered construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

 

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our aggregates business based on net sales by state of destination of texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the great recession 

the great recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry recent years however have shown a turnaround in this trend for the last five years our aggregates shipments have increased reflecting degrees of stability and modest growth however volumes are still below historically normal levels prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 during 2016 our aggregates shipments showed 14 improvement compared with 2015 levels after a 21 increase the prior year this improvement was made in 2016 despite significant levels of rainfall in many of our major markets 

while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to this infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the solvency of the federal highway bill in 2014 we were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 but the funding that was enacted had very little impact during 2016 this time lag with commencement of federal infrastructure funding was accompanied by a reduction in some states’ investment in highway maintenance 

after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions a fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america ’ s surface transportation act the “fast act” was signed into law in late 2015 the fast act funding is primarily secured through gas tax collections market analysis projects aggregate demand to increase with the availability of federal funding with demand peaking in 2018 and thereafter declining with anticipated higher interest and inflation rates while the fast act did not impact 2016 highway spending in a meaningful way the overall highway spending in the united states did increase in 2016 showing the willingness of many states to address underlying demand for this type of spending during the past 24 months many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes 

supported by state spending programs our aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market declined 4 in 2016 compared to an increase of 5 in 2015 compared with 2014 we believe that the demand and need for infrastructure projects will continue to support consistent growth in this market now that longterm federal funding has been resolved in 2016 39 of our product line aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we also sell our aggregates and cement products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall 

 

in 2016 construction growth was driven by privatesector activity nonresidential and residential construction levels are interest ratesensitive and typically move in direct correlation with economic cycles the dodge momentum index a 12month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgraw hill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 remained strong and was at an eightyear high of 1367 in december 2016 a 9 increase over prior year signaling continued growth in nonresidential construction housing starts a key indicator for residential construction activity continue to show yearoveryear improvement while starts exceeded one million in 2016 they still remain below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units that said the company expects to continue to experience gains in the residential market importantly 2016 housing starts exceeded completions a trend expected to continue in 2017 

our aggregates volumes to the nonresidential construction market accounted for 32 of our 2016 aggregates product line shipments and increased 3 compared with 2015 according to the us census bureau spending for the private nonresidential construction market increased 8 in 2016 compared with 2015 historically half of the company’s nonresidential construction shipments have been used for office and retail projects while the remainder has been used for heavy industrial and capacityrelated projects including energysector projects namely development of shalebased natural gas fields however low oil prices in the latter part of 2015 and throughout 2016 has suppressed shale exploration activity in 2016 the company shipped approximately 15 million tons to the energysector compared with approximately 36 million tons in 2015 

the residential construction market accounted for approximately 21 of the company’s aggregates product line shipments in 2016 the company’s exposure to residential construction is typically split evenly between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions including roads sidewalks and storm and sewage drainage and aggregates used in new home construction therefore the timing of new subdivision starts as well as new home starts equally affects residential volumes private residential construction spending increased 5 in 2016 compared with 2015 according to the us census bureau 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of highcalcium carbonate material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales collectively “chemrockrail” accounted for 8 of our aggregates shipments in 2016 ballast shipments declined in 2016 due to lower railroad activity correlating with lower energyrelated rail shipments drier weather and favorable operating conditions led to increased shipments of agricultural limestone in 2016 over 2015 weather conditions in 2015 were abnormally wet limiting field applications and influencing customers to defer their purchases 

shipments of aggregatesrelated downstream products typically follow construction aggregates trends 

the cement business was acquired from txi in 2014 its net sales of 3644 million for 2016 reflected the company’s leading position in the texas market 

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates and cement products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects 

 

accordingly our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the existence of future federal infrastructure funding was resolved near the end of 2015 with the passage of the fast act while the total value of united states overall publicworks spending increased in 2016 federal funding through the fast act did not impact highway spending in any meaningful way this increase in overall public works spending in 2016 demonstrates the commitment of states to address the underlying demand for infrastructure investment we expect to see meaningful impact from the fast act funding beginning in 2017 along with increased infrastructure spending at the state level moreover president trump has proposed additional investment over the next decade to rebuild the country’s infrastructure any such measures will require congressional approval we cannot be assured however of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the current federal highway bill passed in late 2015 the fast act after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions reauthorizes federal highway and transportation funding programs the fast act also changes the transportation infrastructure and innovation act “tifia” funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects under the fast act tifia funding ranges from 275 million to 300 million and no longer requires the 20 matching funds from state departments of transportation 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices until recently fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states have experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina was among the states experiencing these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina began to improve in 2014 and later years as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits prior to the fast act states had also taken on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment for example texas voters in 2014 approved use of the state’s oil and gas production tax collections for annual disbursements to the state highway fund additionally in november 2015 voters passed proposition 7 a constitutional 

 

amendment that will provide for funding for nontoll roads proposition 7 is estimated to provide an additional 20 billion of annual funding for nontoll roads beginning in fiscal 2018 and is expected to increase after 2019 on november 8 2016 texas voters approved 990 million of additional statewide transportation funding including a 720 million transportation bond in austin in north carolina voters approved all transportation referendums during the november 2016 elections totaling 12 billion of additional funding during the past 24 months many states have taken on a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

with most states in recovery or expansion the sustained decline in energy costs may be the catalyst in some markets to boost construction and help our business but those markets that are heavily dependent on the energy sector namely oklahoma and west virginia may with the decrease in oil production experience recessions or continued recessions which would adversely impact our business 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather 

since the heavy construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s aggregates business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated over the last two years by record precipitation in many of our key markets the national oceanic and atmospheric administration “noaa” has tracked precipitation for 122 years according to noaa 2015 represented the wettest year on record for texas and oklahoma while north carolina south carolina colorado and iowa each experienced a topten precipitation year our nation as a whole had its thirdwettest year in noaa recorded history in 2015 extremely wet conditions continued in 2016 in many of our key markets especially in texas with the year ranking the 18th wettest year in the state’s recorded history per noaa further since march 2015 texas and surrounding regions have experienced 18 major flood events these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in 2016 and 2015 so our results for those years or in comparison to other years may not be indicative of our future operating results 

the company’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october in october 2016 rainfall along the eastern seaboard of the united states from hurricane matthew a category5 hurricane approximated 136 trillion gallons additionally hurricane matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the bahamas where the company has a facility 

 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregates deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement business may compete with international competitors who are importing product to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

 

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates 

as discussed previously our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

for example demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates the federal reserve has kept the federal funds rate near zero percent for a number of years the recent 025 increase in the rate in december 2016 comparable to the 025 increase the previous year represented only the second increase since 2008 however certain federal reserve members have predicted they would raise interest rates three more times to at least 125 by the end of 2017 the residential construction market accounted for 21 of our aggregates product line shipments in 2016 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results historically our profitability increased during period of rising interest rates in essence our underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our acquisition of txi in 2014 in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock for example we used our common stock in our acquisition of txi we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected 

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations our largest business acquisition has been our business combination with txi which closed in july 2014 in 2015 we completed the integration of txi’s operations into our own operations which allowed 

 

us to achieve the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we had forecasted from the txi acquisition in fact we completed this integration ahead of schedule and achieved even greater synergies and cost saving than the amount we originally forecasted from the txi acquisition however in connection with the integration of any business that we may acquire it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we have forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might chose to do similar to the acquisition of txi would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we might choose to pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 aggregatesrelated downstream businesses have lower profit margins and can be more volatile 

our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and road paving businesses typically provide lower profit margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore as we expand these operations our overall gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is likely to be adversely affected we saw this impact our gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues in recent years our overall aggregatesrelated downstream operations gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues was 12 for 2016 and 8 for 2015 the overall gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues for our aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk our last fixedprice commitment for a portion of our diesel fuel requirements expired at the end of 2016 

to illustrate how diesel fuel price fluctuations and other energy costs have impacted our business consider the recent years in 2013 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4 lower than we paid in 2012 but the average cost of natural gas was 18 higher than 2012 similarly in 2014 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 8 lower compared to 2013 but the average cost of natural gas increased 24 from 2013 diesel fuel which averaged 282 per gallon in 2014 and 298 per gallon in 2013 represents the single largest component of energy costs for our aggregates business diesel fuel prices declined rapidly during december 2014 ending the year at a per gallon price that was 26 below the 2014 average this trend continued in 2015 as the company’s average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2015 was 205 compared with 302 in 2014 natural gas costs also declined in 2015 down 28 from the 2014 average cost these trends continued in 2016 average diesel fuel prices per gallon fell to 196 in 2016 compared to 205 in 2015 our average diesel fuel prices for 2015 and 2016 were higher than spot market prices by 030 per gallon since we purchased approximately 40 of our diesel fuel under a fixed price fuel agreement which agreement has now expired that had locked in a higher price at an earlier time natural gas costs again declined in 2016 down 25 from the 2015 average cost 

the company has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2017 coal needs approximately 25 of its 2017 natural gas needs and 50 of its 2017 petroleum coke needs 

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 22 of the 2016 direct production costs of our cement business therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement business profitability of the cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 209 and 260 million during 2016 and 2015 respectively 

similarly our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete 

 

respectively some of these raw materials we can produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our aggregatesrelated downstream operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials for 2014 we saw higher prices for these raw materials than 2013 this trend reversed in 2015 when we saw lower prices for these raw materials than 2014 liquid asphalt prices in 2016 were again lower than in 2015 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility 

cement is a commodity and competition is often based mainly on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally fall we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement business 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2016 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 209 million during the year in 2016 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 45 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time 

our cement and magnesia specialties businesses may become capacity constrained 

if our cement or magnesia specialties businesses become capacity constrained they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity constrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize

 

our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws 

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement business 

road paving construction operations present additional risks to our business 

our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also present challenges in the paving construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 99 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business none of the hourly employees of our cement business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2019 and may 2018 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to 

 

capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for thirdparty trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could either positively or negatively affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2016 financial statements 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002  and other related rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of corporate governance reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels until the recent enactment of a new federal highway bill further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities like we did with the acquisition of txi in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies located outside the united states approximately 18 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2016 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign county accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the us dollar this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar in 2016 the strength of the us dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the magnesia specialties business when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our articles of incorporation and bylaws and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

 additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods 

currently the us congress is considering changes in the corporate tax code that if enacted could affect our net earnings while the current expectation is a reduction in corporate tax rates which should favorably affect net earnings we cannot be certain of the impact of the elimination of tax preferences capital investment deductibility or border adjustments among other considerations based on our current assessment a reduction in corporate tax rates to 25 from 35 and the elimination of all current deductions including the statutory percentage depletion deduction would be neutral to both net earnings and free cash flow however this assessment will change depending on the ultimate nature extent andor timing of any tax code changes if any 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

 item 2 properties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2016 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 276 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 29 states canada and the bahamas of which 108 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 58 are on land owned in part and leased in part 103 are on leased land and seven are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and approximate 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2016 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 158 properties in five states of which 127 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances one is on land owned in part and leased in part 29 are on leased land and one is on a facility neither owned or leased where product is sold under an agreement 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement business as it does for its aggregates business for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2016 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last three years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground 

 

mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last two years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful the company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the company’s cement and magnesia specialties businesses 

 

  

     

  

 cement business 

as of december 31 2016 the company through its subsidiaries processed or shipped cement from six properties in one state of which four are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and two are on leased land the company’s cement business has production facilities located at two sites in texas midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth hunter texas north of san antonio the following table summarizes certain information about the company’s cement manufacturing facilities at december 31 2016 

 

 reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2844 acres of land owned by the company as of december 31 2016 the company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 697 million tons 

the company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns crushers preheaterscalciners coolers finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries these cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck 

 

as of december 31 2016 the company through its subsidiaries also operated five cement distribution terminals and owned the real estate at the california cement grinding and packaging facility it sold on september 30 2015 which it expects to sell for noncement use 

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its five reportable business segments 

condition and utilization 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

during 2016 the principal properties of the aggregates business were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however during the economic recession the company adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2016 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 713 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idling could continue the company expects however as the economy continues to recover it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 

during 2016 the texas cement plants were operating on average at 76 percent utilization the company divested of the california cement plant in 2015 the portland cement association “pca” forecasts a 3 increase in demand in texas in 2017 over 2016 the cement business’ leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency due to the 247365 nature of cement operations significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

the company expects future organic earnings growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70 and the strength of the united states dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated by reference the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2016 management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of its newlyacquired ratliff ready mixed concrete operations which are included in the 2016 consolidated financial statements and constituted approximately 1 of consolidated total assets and approximately 1 of net revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2016 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended december 31 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 busi ness tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading supplier of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel for the construction industry used for the construction of infrastructure nonresidential and residential projects in addition aggregates products are used for railroad ballast and in agricultural utility and environmental applications the company’s aggregates business consists primarily of mining processing and selling granite limestone sand and gravel the aggregates business also includes its aggregatesrelated downstream product lines including its heavy building materials such as asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving construction services the company’s cement business produces portland and specialty cements the company also has a magnesia specialties business that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2015 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 82 of the company’s consolidated net sales the company’s cement business accounted for 11 of the company’s consolidated net sales and the company’s magnesia specialties business accounted for 7 of the company’s consolidated net sales within the company’s aggregates business the aggregates product line accounted for 67 of 2015 net sales while the aggregatesrelated downstream operations accounted for 33 of 2015 net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

the company completed over 80 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace the company uses its ability to distribute materials over long distances by rail and water to further expand its operations 

the business has developed further through the following transactions over the past five years in 2011 the company acquired three aggregatesrelated businesses first it acquired the assets of an aggregates asphalt and ready mixed concrete business located in western san antonio texas second it exchanged certain assets with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado region in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river referred to herein as the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment finally the company acquired a privatelyheld ready mixed concrete business in the denver colorado area 

in 2013 the company acquired three aggregates quarries in the greater atlanta georgia area the transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced the company’s existing longterm position in this market 

 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi as a standalone entity was a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states and a major supplier of natural aggregates and readymixed concrete in texas northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma and arkansas txi was the largest supplier of construction aggregates ready mixed concrete concrete products and cement in texas now as a whollyowned subsidiary txi enhances the company’s position as an aggregatesled lowcost operator in the large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states and provides highquality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in addition to the cement business the company acquired as part of the txi acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas the aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations are reported in the company’s west group of its aggregates business as part of an agreement with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested of its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

txi was also a major cement producer in california in 2015 the company divested its california cement business acquired from txi these operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production the divestiture primarily included a cement plant two distribution terminals mobile equipment intangible assets and inventory the company also completed the integration of the txi operations in 2015 and completed three smaller acquisitions which included three aggregate operations and related assets 

between 2001 and 2015 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2015 the company disposed of certain noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2016 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company conducts its aggregates business through three reportable segments the midamerica group southeast group and west group the company’s cement business is reported through the cement segment the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2015 consolidated financial statements the “2015 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2015 annual report to shareholders the “2015 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations in arkansas colorado louisiana texas and wyoming 

the company is a leading supplier of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2015 the company’s aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete from a network of over 400 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 36 states canada and the bahamas generating net sales and earnings from operations of 27 billion and 4290 million respectively 

the aggregates and cement businesses market their products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 42 of the aggregates product line shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates product line shipments have increased each of the past four years reflecting a certain degree of volume stability and modest growth albeit at and from historically low levels prior to 2011 the economic recession resulted in united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments had also suffered as states continued to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues during 2015 the company’s heritage aggregates shipments increased 21 compared with 2014 levels despite the impact of historic levels of rainfall in many of the company’s markets most state budgets began to improve starting in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve or begin to resolve budget deficits 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector highway construction projects after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions since moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century “map21” expired a fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america’s surface transportation act the “fast act” was signed into law on december 4 2015 fast act funding will primarily be secured through gas tax collections in an investigation performed by sc market analytics aggregate demand is projected to increase with the availability of federal funding and is expected to peak in 2018 however we believe that in subsequent years the projected demand for aggregates will decline with anticipated higher interest and inflation rates additionally many states have recently shown a commitment to securing alternative funding sources including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes according to american road and transportation builders association “artba” fifteen states have raised gas taxes and 30 legislative measures which represented 68 of ballot initiatives for transportation funding were approved by voters in 2015 supported by statespending programs the company’s heritage aggregates volumes to the infrastructure market in the eastern united states increased in the midsingle digits in 2015 compared with 2014 overall the infrastructure market accounted for approximately 42 of the company’s 2015 aggregates product line shipments 

 

the fast act will reauthorize federal highway and public transportation programs and stabilize the highway trust fund 2074 billion of the funding will be apportioned to the states by formula with a 51 increase over actual fiscal year 2015 apportionments in 2016 and then inflationary increases in subsequent years meaningful impact from the fast act is not expected before the second half of 2016 

the fast act retains the programs supported under the predecessor bill map21  but with some changes specifically tifia a us department of transportation alternative funding mechanism which under map21 provided three types of federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects will now allow more diversification of projects tifia is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private coinvestment by providing projects with supplemental or subordinate debt that is not subject to national debt ceiling challenges or sequestration since 2012 tifia has provided credit assistance to over 30 projects representing over 49 billion in infrastructure investment under the fast act tifia annual funding will range from 275 million to 300 million and will no longer require the 20 matching funds from state departments of transportation consequently states can advance construction projects immediately with potentially zero upfront outlay of local state department of transportation dollars tifia requires projects to have a revenue source to pay back the credit assistance within a 30 to 40 year period moreover tifia funds may represent up to 49 of total eligible project costs for a tifiasecured loan and 33 for a tifia standby line of credit therefore the tifia program has the ability to significantly leverage construction dollars each dollar of federal funds can provide up to 10 in tifia credit assistance and support up to 30 in transportation infrastructure investment private investment in transportation projects funded through the tifia program is particularly attractive in part due to the subordination of public investment to private management believes tifia could provide a substantial boost for state department of transportation construction programs well above what is currently budgeted as of january 2016 tifia funded projects for the company’s key states texas colorado north carolina georgia and florida exceeded 12 billion 

the federal highway bill provides spending authorizations which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs the federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances map21 extended federal motor fuel taxes through september 30 2016 and truck excise taxes through september 30 2017 of the currently imposed federal gas tax of 0184 per gallon which has been static since 1993 015 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund 

transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans according to the federal highway administration every 1 billion in federal highway investment creates approximately 28000 jobs the number of jobs created is dependent on the nature and aggregates intensity of the projects approximately half of the aggregates business’ net sales to the infrastructure market come from federal funding authorizations including matching funds from the states for each dollar spent on road highway and bridge improvements the federal highway administration estimates an average benefit of 520 is recognized in the form of reduced vehicle maintenance costs reduced delays reduced fuel consumption improved safety reduced road and bridge maintenance costs and reduced emissions as a result of improved traffic flow 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia accounted for 70 of total 2015 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is 

 

accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern and midwestern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall flooding or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets subject to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the coastal areas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses from time to time weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated in 2015 by record precipitation in many of the company’s key markets the national oceanic and atmospheric administration “noaa” has tracked precipitation for 121 years according to noaa 2015 represented the wettest year on record for texas and oklahoma while north carolina south carolina colorado and iowa each experienced a topten precipitation year and the nation as a whole had its third wettest year in noaa recorded history these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in 2015 creating a backlog of construction activity expected to be completed in 2016 the completion of construction activity backlog in 2016 will depend on the capacity of the affected areas to provide enough resources such as construction crews and equipment among others 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

a significant percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments continue to be moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2015 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 75 by truck 21 by rail and 4 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of deepwater and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group that have certain areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population growth and density the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in 2015 243 million tons of aggregates were sold from distribution yards results from these distribution operations lowered the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of the aggregates business by 240 basis points in 2015 the gross margin excluding freight and delivery 

 

revenues of the aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins of the longhaul distribution network 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus part of its capital spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations 

the company’s medina rock and rail capital project with a total cost of 160 million is the largest capital expansion project in its history the project located near san antonio texas consists of a railconnected limestone aggregates processing facility which is expected to ship approximately six million tons in 2016 and have the future capability of producing in excess of 10 million tons per year land acquisitions were completed over several years as part of ongoing capital expenditures and construction began in 2013 the project began operations in january 2016 

the company also acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregate mines which provide a neighborfriendly alternative to surface quarries the company operates 14 active underground mines located primarily in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries 

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution 

 

network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2015 the company did not incur any such charges however a charge is possible in 2016 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products for example in texas competition with operations in the oil and gas fields for thirdparty trucking services constrains the availability of these services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during that period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy has begun to recover from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions including the 2014 txi acquisition particularly in the west group pursuant to which the 

 

company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations these aggregatesrelated downstream operations accounted for 33 of net sales of the aggregates business in 2015 these aggregatesrelated downstream operations reported within the aggregates business segment have lower gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than the company’s aggregates product line due to highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2015 prices for liquid asphalt were lower than 2014 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products we expect the company’s gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues for the legacy txi aggregatesrelated downstream operations to improve similar to the pattern experienced at the colorado aggregatesrelated downstream operations acquired in 2011 

the company continues to review carefully each of the acquired aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own aggregatesrelated downstream operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments in 2011 the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included aggregatesrelated downstream operations including asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the 2014 business combination with txi described under general above further expanded the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations with the addition of txi’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations the txi combination also added the cement operations of txi which are accounted for as a separate business segment of the company 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 123 million 130 million and 168 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 

cement business 

the cement business produces portland and specialty cements cement is the basic binding agent for concrete a primary construction material the principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in texas similar to the aggregates business cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries consequently the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector 

the company has the leading cement position in texas with two production facilities one located in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and the other located in hunter texas north of san antonio in addition to these production facilities the company also operates three cement distribution terminals in texas during 2015 the company also operated a stateoftheart raillocated cement plant in southern california at oro grande california near los angeles california and operated cement grinding and packaging facilities at the crestmore plant near riverside california in addition to the manufacturing and packaging facilities the company also operated two cement distribution terminals in california in 2015 as of september 30 2015 the company sold all of its california cement operations it retained the real estate at the crestmore facility which the company expects to sell for noncement use these operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the company and unlike other marketplace competitors were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production 

cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions according to the portland cement association nearly twothirds of us cement consumption occurs in the six months between may and october the majority of all cement shipments approximately 70 percent are sent to readymix concrete operators the rest are shipped to manufacturers of concrete related products contractors materials dealers oil wellminingdrilling companies as well as government entities 

energy including electricity and fossil fuels accounts for approximately onethird of the cement production cost profile therefore profitability of the cement business is affected by changes in energy prices and the availability of the supply of these products the company currently has fixedprice supply contracts for coal and diesel fuel but also consumes natural gas alternative fuel and petroleum coke further profitability of the cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance this process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2015 the cement business incurred ordinary kiln maintenance shutdown costs of 260 million 

texas and california accounted for 73 and 27 of the cement business’ net sales respectively in 2015 including the california cement operations for the nine months ended september 30 2015 the cement business is benefitting from continued strength in the texas markets where current demand exceeds local supply a trend that is expected to continue for the near future the cement business sold cement to customers in 13 states and mexico truck and rail transportation modes represent 97 and 3 respectively of total tons shipped a portion of the cement is used internally in the company’s ready mixed concrete product line the company shipped a total of 46 million tons of cement in 2015 with 37 million tons shipped to external customers and 09 million tons consumed by the company for internal use of this amount 11 million tons were shipped from the california cement plant prior to its sale as of september 30 2015 for 2015 the cement business generated net sales and earnings from operations of 3676 million and 478 million respectively 

 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

the cement business generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there are no significant levels of order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

less than 2 of the revenues from the cement business are from foreign jurisdictions principally mexico with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 04 million during 2015 and 38 million during 2014 for the period from the july 1 2014 acquisition of txi 

magnesia specialties business 

the company manufactures and markets through its magnesia specialties business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2015 67 of magnesia specialties’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 32 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials magnesia specialties’ net sales declined 36 in 2015 compared with 2014 the reduction reflects a decrease in both the chemicals and dolomitic lime product lines net sales were impacted by lower domestic steel production which was down 9 versus 2014 for 2015 the magnesia specialties business generated net sales and earnings from operations of 2275 million and 689 million respectively 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2015 80 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 20 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 42 of the magnesia specialties’ net sales in 2015 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the magnesia specialties business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel capacity utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 70 in 2015 according to the american iron and steel institute average steel production in 2015 declined 9 versus 2014 and the 2016 forecast is an increase of 2 over 2015 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business 

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with magnesia specialties 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln completed in 2012 at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia risk factors of this form 10k 

approximately 133 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2015 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 327 million 290 million and 257 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the united states dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions however the current strength of the united states dollar in foreign markets is affecting the overall price of magnesia specialties’ products when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 12 2016 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 33 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 112 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts 

 

of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5600 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations are also characterized by numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with about 65000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are about 3700 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company in its aggregates business including its aggregatesrelated downstream operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates industry some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for 133 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2015 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 107 cement plants in 36 states the top five companies collectively operate 496 percent of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 142 percent of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 767 percent of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states in reviewing these figures for cement plants capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity “clinker” is the initial product of cement production cement producers mine materials such as limestone shale or other materials crush and screen the materials and place them in a cement kiln after being heated to extremely high temperatures these materials form marblesized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement 

the company’s cement business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement business also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets a small percentage of the company’s cement sales are to customers located outside the united states with less than 2 of revenues for the cement business in 2015 coming from sales from california to customers in mexico the company divested of its california cement business as of september 30 2015 certain of the company’s competitors in the cement business have greater financial resources than the company 

 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from stone quarries or mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are typically large vertically integrated companies with international operations readymixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks as a result in each local market the company faces competition from numerous small producers as well as large vertically integrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 247 million in 2015 and approximately 196 million in 2014 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 97 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately 90 million in 2016 and 2017 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2015 and 2014 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and 

 

there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2015 financial statements and the 2015 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material 

 

adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2015 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2015 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2015 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry mining and cement production facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with other companies in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the magnesia specialties dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required 

 

the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the magnesia specialties segment of the business 

in october 2014 the company received a caa section 114 request for information regarding the manistee michigan operations from the usepa similar to the one initially received at the woodville ohio plant the letter seeks information regarding the company’s compliance with the nsr program at the magnesia specialties manufacturing plant in manistee michigan no notices of violation have been received by the company relating to alleged noncompliance at the manistee plant the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program and has submitted information to the usepa for review and is awaiting a response or additional questions the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the costs if any that may be incurred relating to this matter 

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties “prps” under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site the usepa has not designated the company as a prp the ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of prps and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time the company believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases “ghg” or “ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule in may 2010 the usepa issued a final rule known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule that would have required the company to incorporate best available ghg control technology in any new plant that it might propose to build and in its existing plants if it modified them in a manner that would increase ghg emissions in the company’s case principally carbon dioxide emissions by more than 75000 tons per year this rule was challenged in court by various public and private parties and was upheld in part and invalidated in part by the united states supreme court in an opinion issued on june 23 2014 the court concluded that the usepa may in fact require best available control technology for ghg but only if the plant is otherwise subject to prevention of significant deterioration or title v air permitting under the usepa’s rules it is not known whether the usepa will revise its rules in response to the court’s decision and if so what the impact will be on the company’s operations no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs such as carbon dioxide have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency and it is not known what the usepa will require as best available control technology for plants or conditions it will require for operating permits in the event of modifications to plants or construction of new plants 

in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap 

 

on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the magnesia specialties operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 

cement production worldwide is estimated to comprise approximately 5 to 10 of co 2 or ghg emissions and the usepa has indicated that co 2 emitted from cement production is the second largest source of co 2 emissions in the united states the company’s subsidiaries riverside cement company and txi file annual reports of the ghg emissions relating to their cement operations in addition as it operated in california riverside cement has been subject to california’s existing ghg emissions tradingcredit program with the sale of its california business riverside will no longer be required to file such reports the company believes that riverside cement has purchased an adequate number of additional emission credits to remain under the regulated limits for the presale periods and that program will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s or the cement business’ financial condition or results of operations 

if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations as well as the company’s cement operations will likely be subject to the new program in addition the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs that will impact the company’s woodville manistee and cement operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville manistee or cement operations would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also continuing to review the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or cement businesses 

in california the california global warming solutions act of 2006 or ab32 required the california air resources board “carb” to implement rules designed to achieve a statewide reduction in emissions of ghgs in california to 1990 levels by 2020 in response carb adopted rules that establish a marketbased capandtrade program which began on january 1 2013 the rules applied to riverside cement’s cement plant in oro grande california however as the plant was sold as of september 30 2015 riverside has no further reporting or compliance obligations for the postclosing periods with respect to these rules 

in 2010 the usepa issued rules that dramatically reduced the permitted emissions of mercury total hydrocarbons particulate matter and hydrochloric acid from cement plants the compliance date for these new 

 

standards was september 2015 but the usepa granted a oneyear extension to verify monitoring systems are effective for mercury and hydrogen chloride emissions the company has conducted tests to analyze the current level of compliance of its cement plants with the new standards all plants required the installation of continuous emissions monitoring “cems” the company through its subsidiary txi identified tested and installed new control and monitoring equipment for these purposes prior to the original september 2015 deadline and believe that the cement plants meet the other emission requirements in these rules the company does not believe that the costs relating to these controls and equipment will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the company or the cement business 

employees 

as of january 31 2016 the company has approximately 7300 employees of which 5543 are hourly employees and 1756 are salaried employees included among these employees are 751 hourly employees represented by labor unions 103 of the company’s employees of such amount 98 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union none of the company’s cement business’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions and 100 of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts for the magnesia specialties business cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in may 2018 the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2019 while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states from timetotime stop or slow bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products during the past few years the overall economy was hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending was affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the recent economic recession was an example and our business was hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our aggregates business based on net sales by state of destination of texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry recent years however have shown a turnaround in this trend for the last four years our aggregates shipments have increased reflecting a certain degree of volume stability and modest growth prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 during 2015 our heritage aggregates shipments showed 21 improvement compared with 2014 levels after a 75 increase the prior year this improvement was made in 2015 despite the impact of historic levels of rainfall in many of our major markets while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending during 2015 the unprecedented uncertainty on both the timing and amount of future longterm federal infrastructure funding had negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects this uncertainty was accompanied by a reduction in some states’ investment in highway maintenance 

after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions a fiveyear 305 billion highway bill fixing america’s surface transportation act “fast act” was signed into law on december 4 2015 fast act funding will primarily be secured through gas tax collections market analysis projects aggregate demand to increase with the availability of federal funding with demand peaking in 2018 and thereafter declining with anticipated higher interest and inflation rates additionally many states have recently shown a commitment to securing alternative funding sources including initiating specialpurpose taxes and raising gas taxes according to american road and transportation builders association “artba” fifteen states have raised gas taxes 

 

and 30 legislative measures which represented 68 of ballot initiatives for transportation funding were approved by voters in 2015 

supported by state spending programs our aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market increased 5 in 2015 compared to an increase of 12 in 2014 compared with 2013 we believe that the demand and need for infrastructure projects will continue to support consistent growth in this market now that longterm federal funding has been resolved in 2015 41 of our product line aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we also sell our aggregates and cement products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall 

in 2015 construction growth was driven by privatesector activity nonresidential and residential construction levels are interest ratesensitive and typically move in direct correlation with economic cycles the dodge momentum index a 12month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgraw hill construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100 remained strong and was 1252 in december 2015 according to dodge data  analytics the recent increasing trend of the index is an indication that construction growth will continue into 2016 

our aggregates volumes to the nonresidential construction market accounted for 32 of our 2015 aggregates product line shipments and increased 3 compared with 2014 light nonresidential which includes the commercial sector increased 27 and was partially offset by a decline in heavy nonresidential which includes the industrial and energy sectors nonresidential investment varies significantly by state texas continues to lead the nation in nonresidential construction demonstrating economic diversity and the ability to replace energyrelated shipments currently displaced by low oil prices with other residential projects even with its challenging commodity price environment we expect continued energyrelated activity on a national scale florida and south carolina each rank in the top 10 states and north carolina and colorado each rank in the top 20 states in growth based on dollars invested in nonresidential construction notably recovery in the residential market typically leads to nonresidential growth with a 12to18month lag 

our aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 20 in 2015 housing strength varies considerably in different areas of the country we saw significant residential growth in our key geographic markets including florida georgia north carolina and texas the us census bureau reported the total value of private residential construction put in place in 2015 increased 13 furthermore housing starts a key indicator for residential construction activity continues to show yearoveryear improvement while 2015 represented the second year that starts exceeded one million since 2008 they still remain below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units importantly 2015 housing starts exceeded completions a trend expected to continue in 2016 geographically housing strength varies considerably by state and texas leads the nation in residential starts notably dallasfort worth is the second ranked metro area in the united states for growth in housing permits additionally florida south carolina colorado and north carolina each rank in the top ten states for residential starts in 2015 17 of our aggregates shipments were to the residential construction market 

our aggregates product line shipment variances in 2015 for the midamerica and southeast groups reflect the ongoing recovery in these markets notably georgia florida and north carolina while shipments in the west group were up due to acquired operations volumes reflect the significant precipitation in texas 

 

oklahoma and colorado which deferred certain shipments to future periods the west group volume variance in 2015 was also impacted by the divestiture of the north troy quarry and two rail yards which were sold in the third quarter of 2014 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of highcalcium carbonate material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales collectively “chemrockrail” accounted for 10 of our aggregates shipments and increased 10 in 2015 

shipments of aggregatesrelated downstream products typically follow construction aggregates trends 

the cement business was acquired from txi on july 1 2014 the net sales of 3676 million for 2015 reflected the company’s leading position in the texas market 

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates and cement products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the year 2015 was another year of unprecedented uncertainty as it related to both the timing and amount of future longterm federal infrastructure funding which negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects despite the uncertainty in longterm funding levels which wasn’t resolved until near the end of the year the total value of united states overall publicworks spending increased in 2015 however federal funding remained flat for the year this increase in overall public works spending in 2015 demonstrates the commitment of states to address the underlying demand for infrastructure investment however infrastructure investment continued to vary by market and was strongest in the southwestern and southeastern united states in 2015 we saw increased infrastructure spending in 2015 in texas north carolina iowa and georgia four of our five largest revenue generating states we cannot be assured however of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in december 2015 the fast act after a decade of 36 shortterm funding provisions reauthorizes federal highway and transportation funding programs and stabilizes the highway trust fund the fast act also changes tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects under the fast act tifia funding will range from 275 million to 300 million and will no longer require the 20 matching funds from state departments of transportation 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices until recently fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years according to the congressional budget office current revenues of approximately 34 billion are falling short of the current annual expenditure level of 41 billion therefore timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent 

 

sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states have experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina was among the states experiencing these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina began to improve in 2014 and 2015 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits prior to the fast act states had also taken on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment for example the texas voters in 2014 approved use of the state’s oil and gas production tax collections for annual disbursements to the state highway fund additionally in november 2015 voters passed proposition 7 a constitutional amendment that will provide an additional 25 billion of funding for nontoll roads beginning in 2017 we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

with the passage of fast act in december 2015 the infrastructure market should have increased activity in 2016 and beyond which should help our business with most states in recovery or expansion the sustained decline in energy costs may be the catalyst in some markets to boost construction and help our business but those markets heavily dependent on the energy sector namely oklahoma and west virginia may result in recessions in those areas with the decrease in oil production which would hurt our business 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s aggregates business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable weatherrelated hindrances were exacerbated in 2015 by record precipitation in many of our key markets the national oceanic and atmospheric administration “noaa” has tracked precipitation for 121 years according to noaa 2015 represented the wettest year on record for texas and oklahoma while north carolina south carolina colorado and iowa each experienced a topten precipitation year our nation as a whole had its third wettest year in noaa recorded history these weather events reduced the company’s overall profitability in 2015 creating a backlog of construction activity expected to be completed in 2016 the completion of construction activity backlog in 2016 will depend on the capacity of the affected areas to provide enough resources such as construction crews and equipment among others 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine 

 

them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement business may compete with international competitors who are importing product to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates 

as discussed previously our operations are highly dependent upon the interest ratesensitive construction and steelmaking industries therefore business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase 

for example demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate near zero percent for the majority of 2015 the recent increase in the rate by 025 represented the first increase since 2008 the residential construction market accounted for 17 of our aggregates product line shipments in 2015 

aside from these inherent risks from within our operations our earnings are also affected by changes in shortterm interest rates however rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results in fact since 2007 our profitability increased when interest rates rose based on the last twelve months 

 

quarterly historical net income regression versus a 10year us government bond in essence our underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates 

rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets which could affect our business as described in greater detail under “ disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business” below 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our acquisition of txi in 2014 in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock for example we used our common stock in our acquisition of txi we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not for example in 2015 we completed the integration of the operations of txi as discussed below which was more successful than anticipated we have sold some underperforming and other nonstrategic assets such as underperforming road paving operations in arkansas and east texas which were sold in 2014 and our noncore asphalt operations in san antonio texas which were sold in 2015 

our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as we hope 

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations our largest business acquisition has been our business combination with txi which closed in july 2014 in 2015 we completed the integration of txi’s operations into our own operations which allowed us to achieve the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we had forecast from the txi acquisition in fact we completed this integration ahead of schedule and achieved even greater synergies and cost saving than the amount we originally forecast from the txi acquisition however in connection with the integration of any business that we may seek to acquire it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we have forecast from the acquisition 

any other significant business acquisition or combination we might chose to do like the acquisition of txi would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations we believe we would be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we might choose to pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer 

 

than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 aggregatesrelated downstream businesses have lower profit margins and can be more volatile 

for 2015 our asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses accounted for 33 of the net sales of our aggregates business up from 8 in 2011 these businesses typically provide lower profit margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore as we expand these operations our overall gross margin is likely to be adversely affected we saw this impact our gross margin in recent years our overall aggregatesrelated downstream operations gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues was 89 for 2015 and 2014 the overall gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices we enter into fixedprice fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk we currently have a fixedprice commitment for approximately 40 of our diesel fuel requirements at a rate of 220 per gallon through december 31 2016 

to illustrate how diesel fuel price fluctuations and other energy costs have impacted our business consider the recent years in 2013 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4 lower than we 

 

paid in 2012 but the average cost of natural gas was 18 higher than 2012 similarly in 2014 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 8 lower compared to 2013 but the average cost of natural gas increased 24 from 2013 diesel fuel which averaged 282 per gallon in 2014 and 298 per gallon in 2013 represents the single largest component of energy costs for our aggregates business diesel fuel prices declined rapidly during december 2014 ending the year at a per gallon price that was 26 below the 2014 average this trend continued in 2015 as the company’s average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2015 was 205 on 425 million gallons compared with 302 on 369 million gallons in 2014 natural gas costs also declined in 2015 down 28 from the 2014 average cost 

the company has fixed price agreements for 100 of its 2016 coal needs the magnesia specialties business has fixed price agreements for the supply of a portion of its coal and natural gas needs 

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represented approximately 26 of the 2015 direct production costs of our cement business therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement business profitability of the cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2014 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 133 million during the second half of the year in 2015 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 26 million for the full year 

similarly our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively some of these raw materials we can produce internally but most are purchased from third parties these purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our aggregatesrelated downstream operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials for 2014 we saw higher prices for these raw materials than 2013 this trend reversed in 2015 when we saw lower prices for these raw materials than 2014 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility 

cement is a commodity and competition is often based mainly on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices change a lot in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally fall we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement business 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or 

 

damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions we have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2015 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 26 million during the year in 2015 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 51 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time 

our cement and magnesia specialties businesses may become capacity constrained 

if our cement or magnesia specialties businesses become capacity constrained they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity constrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize

our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws 

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan will expire in 2016 unless it is extended by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement business 

road paving construction operations present additional risks to our business 

our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also present challenges in the paving construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time or our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 98 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business none of the hourly employees of our cement business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2019 and may 2018 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for third party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2015 financial statements additional accounting standard updates have been issued effective january 1 2018 that amend the accounting guidance on revenue recognition and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices and improving disclosure requirements we are currently reviewing how these new provisions will affect us at this time we do not expect the changes to have a material impact on our financial results new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002  and other related rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of corporate governance reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements and exposure to adverse findings by the pcaob of the work performed may increase as to internal controls 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels until the recent enactment of a new federal highway bill further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our 

 

cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities like we did with the acquisition of txi in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our magnesia specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies located outside the united states approximately 133 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2015 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign county accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business therefore the operations of the magnesia specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the us dollar the business tries to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates by using the us dollar as its functional currency in foreign transactions this still leaves the business subject to certain risks depending on the strength of the us dollar in 2015 the strength of the us dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the magnesia specialties business when compared to foreigndomiciled competitors 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

 item 2 prop erties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2015 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 272 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 26 states canada and the bahamas of which 109 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 57 are on land owned in part and leased in part 99 are on leased land and 7 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and exceed 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2015 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 131 properties in 5 states of which 109 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part 20 are on leased land and 1 is on a facility neither owned or leased where product is sold under an agreement 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are 

 

tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement business as it does for its aggregates business for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2015 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful the company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the company’s cement and magnesia specialties businesses 

 

  

     

  

 cement business 

as of december 31 2015 the company through its subsidiaries processed or shipped cement from 6 properties in 1 state of which 5 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 1 is on leased land the company’s cement business has production facilities located at two sites in texas midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth hunter texas north of san antonio the following table summarizes certain information about the company’s cement manufacturing facilities at december 31 2015 

 

 reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2844 acres of land owned by the company as of december 31 2015 the company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 701 million tons 

the company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns crushers preheaterscalciners coolers finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries these cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck 

as of december 31 2015 the company through its subsidiaries also operated 3 cement distribution terminals and owned the real estate at the california cement grinding and packaging facility it sold on september 30 2015 which it expects to sell for noncement use 

 

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its five reportable business segments 

condition and utilization 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

during 2015 the principal properties of the aggregates business were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however during the economic recession the company adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2015 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 367 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idling could continue the company expects however as the economy continues to recover it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 

during 2015 the texas cement plants were operating on average at 70 percent utilization the company divested of the california cement plant in 2015 the portland cement association “pca” forecasts a 25 increase in demand in texas in 2016 over 2015 the cement business’ leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency and a road map for significantly improved profitability for 2016 and beyond due to the 247365 nature of cement operations significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

the company expects future organic growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70 and the strength of the united states dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual statement of financial responsibility and report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2015 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2015 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2015 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2015 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2015 annual report

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading supplier of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel and heavy building materials cement for the construction industry including infrastructure nonresidential residential railroad ballast agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications the company’s aggregates business consists primarily of mining processing and selling granite limestone sand and gravel the aggregates business also includes its aggregatesrelated downstream product lines including its asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving construction services the company’s cement business acquired on july 1 2014 with the acquisition of texas industries inc “txi” produces portland and specialty cements such as masonry and oil well cements with production and distribution facilities in texas and california the company also has a magnesia specialties business that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2014 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 83 of the company’s consolidated net sales the company’s cement business accounted for 8 of the company’s consolidated net sales and the company’s magnesia specialties business accounted for 9 of the company’s consolidated net sales within the company’s aggregates business the aggregates products line accounted for 70 of 2014 net sales while the aggregatesrelated downstream operations accounted for 30 of 2014 net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river and provided the company a shipping position from the bahamas smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the ohio river valley and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas additionally in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business these acquisitions increased the company’s ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

these transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions with the company completing over 80 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

 

in 2008 the company entered into an asset exchange transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this exchange the company divested to vulcan the only california quarry it then owned located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased related to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port facility in port canaveral florida which serves the greater orlando market the secondlargest aggregatesconsuming area in florida the port canaveral acquisition the only developed deepwater aggregates import terminal located on florida’s central east coast was complemented by the company’s organic investment in 2010 in a new aggregates import facility at port manatee florida 

in 2011 the company acquired three aggregatesrelated businesses first it acquired the assets of an aggregates asphalt and ready mixed concrete business located in western san antonio texas second it exchanged certain assets with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado region in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river referred to herein as the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment finally the company acquired a privatelyheld ready mixed concrete business in the denver colorado area 

in 2013 the company acquired three aggregates quarries in the greater atlanta georgia area the transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced the company’s existing longterm position in this market 

in 2014 the company completed the acquisition of txi further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials txi as a standalone entity was a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states and a major supplier of natural aggregates and readymixed concrete in texas northern louisiana and to a lesser extent in oklahoma and arkansas txi was the largest supplier of construction aggregates ready mixed concrete concrete products and cement in texas txi was also a major cement producer in california now as a whollyowned subsidiary txi enhances the company’s position as an aggregatesled low cost operator in the large and fastgrowing geographies in the united states and provides high quality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete 

in addition to the cement business the company acquired as part of the txi acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution terminals located in texas louisiana and oklahoma the company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants situated primarily in three areas of texas the dallasfort worthdenton area of north texas the austin area of central texas and from beaumont to texarkana in east texas in north and central louisiana and in southwestern arkansas the aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations are reported in the company’s west group of its aggregates business as part of an agreement with the united states department of justice’s review of the transaction the company divested of its north troy quarry in oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in dallas and frisco texas 

 

between 2001 and 2014 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses during 2014 the company disposed of certain underperforming road paving operations in arkansas and east texas the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2015 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company conducts its aggregates business through three reportable segments the midamerica group southeast group and west group the company’s cement business is reported through the cement segment the company also has the magnesia specialties segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2014 consolidated financial statements the “2014 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2014 annual report to shareholders the “2014 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations in arkansas colorado louisiana texas and wyoming 

the company is a leading supplier of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2014 the company’s aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete from a network of over 400 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 32 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 22 billion and 3201 million respectively 

the aggregates and cement business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 44 of its aggregates shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects the company believes publicworks projects have historically accounted for approximately 50 of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the united states these businesses benefit from publicworks construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

 

the company’s aggregates shipments volume has ranged from 122 million tons to 146 million tons over the last four years reflecting a certain degree of volume stability albeit at historically low levels in a cyclical neartrough environment during 2014 the company’s heritage aggregates shipments increased 75 compared with 2013 levels prior to 2010 the economic recession resulted in unprecedented reductions in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments had also suffered as states continued to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues most state budgets began to improve in 2013 and 2014 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve or begin to resolve budget deficits 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector construction projects the current federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act  or map21 provides for infrastructure spending of approximately 40 billion per year but the bill expired by its terms on september 30 2014 however as congress continues to deliberate a successor bill the provisions of map21 have been extended through may 31 2015 additionally congress authorized a 108 billion general fund transfer to the highway trust fund to maintain its solvency these measures have not completely alleviated the reluctance by some states and municipalities to commit to large scale multiyear infrastructure projects supported by federal funding 

during the recent extended period of uncertainty in the level of federal funding some states have shown a commitment to securing alternative funding sources for example voters in texas passed proposition 1 in the november 2014 elections which authorizes annual disbursements from the state’s oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund supported by statespending programs heritage aggregates volumes to the infrastructure market increased 6 compared with 2013 

map21 also significantly expanded funding under the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act  or tifia tifia a us department of transportation alternative funding mechanism provides federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects the company believes that the continued impact of tifia which has the ability to leverage up to 50 billion in financing for transportation projects of either national or regional significance along with actions of the company’s key states to utilize various funding alternatives to support important infrastructure jobs should provide an impetus for increased infrastructure spending in 2015 and beyond 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia accounted for 68 of total 2014 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern and midwestern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall flooding or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets subject to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not 

 

necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses from time to time 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2014 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 76 by truck 19 by rail and 5 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of deepwater and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population growth and density the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in 2014 217 million tons of aggregates were sold from distribution yards results from these distribution operations lowered the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of the aggregates business by 210 basis points in 2014 the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of the aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins of the longhaul distribution network 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus part of its capital spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations 

the company’s medina rock and rail capital project with a budgeted cost of nearly 160 million is the largest capital expansion project in its history the project located outside of san antonio texas consists of building a railconnected limestone aggregates processing facility with the capability of producing in excess of 10 million tons per year land acquisition was completed over several years as part of ongoing capital expenditures and construction began in 2013 through the end of 2014 the company invested nearly 79 million including 41 million in 2014 the project is expected to be completed on time and under budget in 2015 

the company also acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations this property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining in either instance the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand 

 

a longterm capital focus for the company primarily in the midwestern united states due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply is underground limestone aggregate mines which provide a neighborfriendly alternative to surface quarries the company operates 14 active underground mines located primarily in the midamerica group and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the united states production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher development explosives and depreciation costs however these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to valueadded higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries 

the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2014 the company did not incur any such charges however a charge is possible in 2015 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train 

 

requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products for example in texas competition with operations in the oil and gas fields for thirdparty trucking services constrains the availability of these services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation slowed in the last several years as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declined during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets management believes the number of acquisition opportunities has started to increase as the economy has begun to recover from the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions including the recently completed txi acquisition particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations these aggregatesrelated downstream operations accounted for 30 of net sales of the aggregates business in 2014 these aggregatesrelated downstream operations reported within the aggregates business segment have lower gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than the company’s aggregates product line due to highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2014 prices for liquid asphalt and cement were higher than 2013 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

the company continues to review carefully each of the acquired aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent aggregatesrelated downstream operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own aggregatesrelated downstream operations or operations that might be 

 

vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments in 2011 the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included aggregatesrelated downstream operations including asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the 2014 business combination with txi described under general above further expanded the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations with the addition of txi’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations the company now accounts for the cement operations of txi as a separate business segment as described below under the cement business heading 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 130 million 168 million and 205 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

cement business 

the cement business produces portland and specialty cements such as masonry and oil well cements similar to the aggregates business cement is used in infrastructure projects nonresidential and residential construction and the railroad agricultural utility and environmental industries the company has the leading position in the texas cement market with two production facilities one located in midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth and the other located in hunter texas between austin and san antonio the company also has a stateoftheart raillocated cement plant in southern california at oro grande california near los angeles california and operates cement grinding and packaging facilities at the crestmore plant near riverside california the cement facilities have an annual capacity of approximately 66 million tons in addition to the manufacturing and packaging facilities the company operates five cement distribution terminals 

texas and california accounted for 71 and 24 of the cement business’ net sales respectively in 2014 the cement business is benefitting from continued strength in the texas markets where current demand exceeds local supply a trend that is expected to continue for the near future the company anticipates the california markets reaching a demandsupply equilibrium during 2016 the cement business sold cement to customers in 13 states with texas accounting for 71 of net sales by state of destination truck and rail transportation modes represent 89 and 11 respectively of total tons shipped a portion of the cement from the cement business is used in the company’s ready mixed concrete product line 

 

the limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property owned by the company adjacent to each of the cement plants management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

the cement business generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there are no significant levels of order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers  

less than 2 of the revenues from the cement business are from foreign jurisdictions principally mexico with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 38 million during 2014 for the period from the july 1 2014 acquisition of txi 

magnesia specialties business 

the company manufactures and markets through its magnesia specialties business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2014 66 of magnesia specialties’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 33 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials magnesia specialties’ net sales increased to record levels in 2014 reflecting increased pricing and solid pricing gains in key product line 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2014 84 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 16 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 44 of the magnesia specialties’ net sales in 2014 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the magnesia specialties business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 77 in 2014 according to moody’s credit outlook steel production in 2014 increased 13 over 2013 and the 2015 forecast is an increase of 2 over 2014 accordingly to platt a division of mcgraw hill financial capacity utilization for 2014 was 77 and is expected to continue at this level or slightly improve in 2015 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business 

the principal raw materials used in the magnesia specialties business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with magnesia specialties 

in 2001 the magnesia specialties business sold certain assets of its refractories business to a whollyowned subsidiary of minerals technologies inc in connection with the sale the business improved its cost structure through the write down of certain assets and the repositioning of the manistee michigan operating facility to focus on the production of chemical products the sale of the refractories business lessened the dependence of the magnesia specialties business on the steel industry over time 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers a significant portion of the 275000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from the new lime kiln completed in 2012 at woodville ohio is committed under a longterm supply contract 

the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee the segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under item ia risk factors of this form 10k 

approximately 11 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business in 2014 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 290 million 257 million and 242 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the united states dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 13 2015 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 54 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 114 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5600 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s aggregatesrelated downstream operations are also characterized by numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with about 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are about 3700 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company in its aggregates business including its aggregatesrelated downstream operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates industry some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s magnesia specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for 11 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2014 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company 

according to the portland cement association united states cement production is widely dispersed with the operation of 107 cement plants in 36 states the top five companies collectively operate 496 percent of us clinker capacity with the largest company representing 142 percent of all domestic clinker capacity an estimated 767 percent of us clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the united states 

the company’s cement business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity quality and price for its products but level of customer service is also a factor the cement business also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets a small percentage of the company’s cement sales are to customers located outside the united states with less than 2 of revenues for the cement business in 2014 coming from sales from california to customers in mexico certain of the company’s competitors in the cement business have greater financial resources than the company 

 

the nature of the company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities crushed stone production from stone quarries or mines or sand and gravel production by dredging is moderately capital intensive the company’s major competitors in the aggregates markets are typically large vertically integrated companies with international operations readymixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks as a result in each local market the company faces competition from numerous small producers as well as large vertically integrated companies with facilities in many markets construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design obtain regulatory permits acquire equipment and construct a plant most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 196 million in 2014 and approximately 126 million in 2013 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 60 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately 60 million in 2015 and 2016 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2014 and 2013 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2014 financial statements and the 2014 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material 

 

adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2014 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2014 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2014 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry mining and cement production facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

as is the case with other companies in the cement industry the company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust “ckd” this production byproduct consists of finegrained solid highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices because much of the ckd is actually unreacted raw materials it is generally permissible to recycle the ckd back into the production process and large amounts often are treated in such manner ckd that is not returned to the production process is disposed in landfills ckd is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the magnesia specialties dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required 

 

the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the magnesia specialties segment of the business 

in october 2014 the company received a caa section 114 request for information regarding the manistee michigan operations from the usepa similar to the one initially received at the woodville ohio plant the letter seeks information regarding the company’s compliance with the nsr program at the magnesia specialties manufacturing plant in manistee michigan no notices of violation have been received by the company relating to alleged noncompliance at the manistee plant the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program and is currently submitting information to the usepa for review the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the costs if any that may be incurred relating to this matter 

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties “prps” under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site the usepa has not designated the company as a prp the ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of prps and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time the company believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases “ghg” or “ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule in may 2010 the usepa issued a final rule known as the greenhouse gas tailoring rule that would have required the company to incorporate best available ghg control technology in any new plant that it might propose to build and in its existing plants if it modified them in a manner that would increase ghg emissions in the company’s case principally carbon dioxide emissions by more than 75000 tons per year this rule was challenged in court by various public and private parties and was upheld in part and invalidated in part by the united states supreme court in an opinion issued on june 23 2014 the court concluded that the usepa may in fact require best available control technology for ghg but only if the plant is otherwise subject to prevention of significant deterioration or title v air permitting under the usepa’s rules it is not known whether the usepa will revise its rules in response to the court’s decision and if so what the impact will be on the company’s operations no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing ghgs such as carbon dioxide have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency and it is not known what the usepa will require as best available control technology for plants or conditions it will require for operating permits in the event of modifications to plants or construction of new plants 

in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap 

 

on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s magnesia specialties business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the magnesia specialties operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 

cement production worldwide is estimated to comprise approximately 5 to 10 of co 2 or ghg emissions and the usepa has indicated that co 2 emitted from cement production is the second largest source of co 2 emissions in the united states the company’s subsidiaries riverside cement company and txi are filing annual reports of the ghg emissions relating to their cement operations in addition as it operates in california riverside cement is subject to california’s existing ghg emissions tradingcredit program the company believes that riverside cement has purchased an adequate number of additional emission credits to remain under the regulated limits and that program will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s or the cement business’ financial condition or results of operations 

if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations as well as the company’s cement operations will likely be subject to the new program in addition the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs that will impact the company’s woodville manistee and cement operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville manistee or cement operations would be passed on to customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also continuing to review the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the magnesia specialties or cement businesses 

in california the california global warming solutions act of 2006 or ab32 required the california air resources board “carb” to implement rules designed to achieve a statewide reduction in emissions of ghgs in california to 1990 levels by 2020 in response carb adopted rules that establish a marketbased capandtrade program which began on january 1 2013 the rules apply to riverside cement’s cement plant in oro grande california the rules establish a statewide cap on the level of ghg emissions from covered industries for each year from 2013 to 2020 the cap declines approximately 2 to 3 per year individual facilities will not be assigned a specific limit on ghg emissions instead a facility will be required to surrender allowances each covering the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide equal to its total ghg emissions carb will allocate allowances equal to the declining cap in a manner prescribed by the rules as part of the program carb will provide significant free allowances to cement plants because the sector is considered by carb to 

 

be energy intensive and trade exposed a cement plant’s allocation of free allowances is based on the california cement sector intensity benchmark determined by carb which is referred to as ghg intensity ie ghg emissions per unit of production the plant’s annual ghg intensity is compared to the carb benchmark and any emissions over the established benchmark are required to be purchased in the form of allowances or allowance offsets if a plant’s emissions exceed the number of allowances it receives it may purchase additional allowances in the open market buy them at a regular quarterly auction conducted by carb or purchase them from a state price containment reserve the rules established a minimum price of 10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent which increases by a minimum of 5 plus inflation each year and actual prices will depend on market conditions a plant’s level of free allowances will be reduced over time with the implementation of a cap adjustment factor intended to gradually reduce the statewide cap over time the company expects that the number of free allowances allocated to riverside cement will not be sufficient to cover all of its ghg emissions but it will be unable to determine the total number of allowances that riverside cement will be required to purchase for any year until the year ends and its total ghg emissions for the period are determined riverside cement has begun to purchase allowances to cover ghg emissions that it expects will exceed its free allowances in addition to the cost of purchasing allowances riverside cement also expects that its energy costs will increase due to the impact of these regulations on the electric utility industry the california cement industry is discussing a number of issues with carb including a california border adjustment mechanism to help create a level playing field with imported cement but it is uncertain whether such a mechanism will be implemented the validity of the law and rules remains under attack in several lawsuits the results of which remain uncertain the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of cement businesses 

various states have banded together in initiatives to develop regional strategies to address climate change certain western states including california and canadian provinces have formed the western climate initiative which is working to establish goals for the reduction of ghg emissions in the member states and design marketbased mechanisms to help achieve these reduction goals california’s climate change laws and regulations are designed to coordinate with the western climate initiative other states may join these initiatives or form additional initiatives or coalitions intended to regulate the emission of ghgs 

in 2010 the usepa issued rules that dramatically reduced the permitted emissions of mercury total hydrocarbons particulate matter and hydrochloric acid from cement plants the compliance date for these new standards is september 2015 the company has conducted tests to analyze the current level of compliance of its newlyacquired cement plants with the standards in the revised rule all plants will require the installation of continuous emissions monitoring “cems” in addition the cement plant in oro grande california will require new controls to satisfy the mercury emission standard and the hydrochloric acid standard the company through its subsidiaries riverside cement and txi have identified tested and ordered new control and monitoring equipment for these purposes and believe that the cement plants meet the other emission requirements in these rules the company does not believe that the costs relating to these controls and equipment will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the company or the cement business 

employees 

as of january 31 2015 the company has 7193 employees of which 5435 are hourly employees and 1758 are salaried employees included among these employees are 878 hourly employees represented by labor unions 122 of the company’s employees of such amount 118 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union 308 of the company’s cement business’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions and 100 of the magnesia specialties segment’s hourly employees are

our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states from timetotime stop or slow bidding projects in their transportation departments 

 

we sell most of our aggregate products our primary business and our cement products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our businesses depend on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products during the past few years the overall economy was hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending was affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products the recent economic recession was an example and our business was hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our business operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our aggregates business based on net sales by state of destination of texas colorado north carolina iowa and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry recent years however have shown a turnaround in this trend for the last four years our aggregates shipments ranged from 122 million tons to 146 million tons reflecting a certain degree of volume stability during 2014 our heritage aggregates shipments showed 75 improvement compared with 2013 levels after being relatively flat the prior year prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending during 2014 the unprecedented uncertainty on both the timing and amount of future longterm federal infrastructure funding negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects this uncertainty was accompanied by a reduction in some states’ investment in highway maintenance other states however stepped up to play an expanding role in infrastructure spending with the total value of public infrastructure spending increasing slightly in 2014 despite the uncertainty in longterm federal funding 

in july 2012 the president signed into law the successor federal highway bill known as map21 which was designed to maintain highway spending at current annual levels of approximately 40 billion in funding for transportation infrastructure through fiscal 2014 map21 also greatly expanded tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects while the enactment of map21 resulted in an increase in infrastructure spending for a period of time map21 expired by its terms on september 30 2014 however as congress continues to deliberate a successor bill the provisions of map21 have been extended through may 31 2015 additionally congress authorized a 108 billion general fund transfer to the highway trust fund to maintain its solvency we are not clear when or in what form there might be a successor bill to map21 the measures to extend map21 and add solvency to the highway trust fund have not completely alleviated the reluctance by some states and municipalities to commit to largescale multiyear infrastructure projects supported by federal aid during the recent extended period of uncertainty in the level of federal funding some states have secured alternative funding sources including texas whose voters in 2014 approved use of the state’s oil and gas production tax collections for annual disbursements to the state highway fund supported by state spending programs our heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market increased 6 in 2014 compared to 2013 as compared to a decrease of 7 in 2013 compared with 2012 

 

we believe that the demand and need for infrastructure projects will support consistent growth in this market once longterm federal funding is resolved beyond 2015 in 2014 44 of our aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we also sell our aggregates and cement products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall 

we experienced a 9 increase in aggregates shipments to the nonresidential construction market in 2014 with growth notable in the energyrelated shipments which benefitted from shale energy projects principally in south texas as well as energyrelated industrial activity additionally increased aggregates shipments to the commercial part of nonresidential construction namely office and retail increased in certain of our geographic markets in colorado georgia north carolina and texas during 2014 a strengthened residential market precipitated nonresidential construction activities to serve increased populations recently the rate of growth in residential construction has slowed but the nonresidential construction market continues to gain momentum this evolution is in line with expectations as the commercial component of nonresidential construction generally follows the residential construction market with a 12to18 month lag with the recent decline in global oil prices we are uncertain the impact this decline will have on the current strong texas economy the dodge momentum index a 12month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by mcgraw hill construction reached 1287 in december 2014 an increase of 4 compared to prior month and an increase of 9 compared to prior year in 2014 32 of our aggregates shipments were to the nonresidential construction market 

our aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 12 in 2014 housing strength varies considerably in different areas of the country we saw significant residential growth in our key geographic markets including florida georgia north carolina and texas the us census bureau reported the total value of private residential construction put in place in 2014 increased 5 furthermore housing starts a key indicator for residential construction activity continues to show yearoveryear improvement although starts are still below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million units for 2014 annual housing starts were up 3 to an estimated 1004000 as reported by the united states census bureau and the rate of housing starts continues to exceed completions this trend is expected to continue in 2015 in 2014 14 of our aggregates shipments were to the residential construction market 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of highcalcium carbonate material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales collectively “chemrockrail” accounted for 10 of our aggregates shipments and increased 4 in 2014reflecting growth in nonconstruction specifically landscaping and backfill 

shipments of aggregatesrelated downstream products typically follow construction aggregates trends 

the cement business was acquired from txi on july 1 2014 the net sales of 2096 million for the second half of 2014 reflected the company’s leading position in the texas market 

our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates and cement products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects the 

 

year 2014 was another year of unprecedented uncertainty as it related to both the timing and amount of future longterm federal infrastructure funding which negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects despite the uncertainty in longterm funding levels the total value of united states overall publicworks spending increased slightly in 2014 which demonstrates the commitment of states to address the underlying demand for infrastructure investment however infrastructure investment varies by market and was strongest in the western united states in 2014 we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in 2012 map21 provided annual funding at current levels of approximately 40 billion through september 30 2014 when it expired by its own terms map21 also greatly expands tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects to 1 billion in fiscal 2014 map21 is not subject to potential sequestration under current federal law tifia is also not subject to federal debt ceiling limits however authorized transfers from the general fund to the highway trust fund are subject to potential sequestration in 2014 as congress continued to deliberate a successor bill to map21 the provisions of map21 were extended to may 31 2015 additionally congress authorized a 108 billion general fund transfer to the highway trust fund to maintain its solvency 

given the record level of national debt and the resulting pressure on all government spending we cannot be assured that congress will pass a successor federal highway bill or will extend the provisions of the current bill when they expire on may 31 2015 federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years according to the congressional budget office current revenues of approximately 34 billion are falling short of the current annual expenditure level of 41 billion therefore timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund and to enact a longerterm federal highway bill we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future we also cannot be assured of the impact of the recent sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the highway trust fund 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states have experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina was among the states experiencing these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina began to improve in 2013 and 2014 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits states have also taken on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment for example the texas voters in 2014 approved use of the state’s oil and gas production tax collections for annual disbursements to the state highway fund we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty in 

 

the november 2014 elections voters approved 66 of transportation initiatives nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s aggregates business including all of its aggregatesrelated downstream operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other 

 

chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as other examples our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement business may compete with international competitors who are importing product to the united states with lower production and regulatory costs 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire like our recent acquisition of txi in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock for example we used our common stock in our recent acquisition of txi we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not for example we have only begun the process of integrating the operations of txi as discussed below we have sold some underperforming and other nonstrategic assets such as underperforming road paving operations in arkansas and east texas which were sold in 2014 

our integration of the acquisition of txi may not be as successful as we hope 

we have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations we acquired txi in july 2014 and are continuing the integration of txi’s ready mixed concrete and cement operations we integrated txi’s aggregates operations into our disciplined cost structure during the last half of 2014 we expect this continued integration to be successful in order for us to achieve the synergies cost savings and operating efficiencies we have forecast from the txi acquisition however it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies cost savings or operating efficiencies we have forecast from the txi acquisition 

the acquisition of txi involved the combination of two companies which previously operated as independent public companies we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations as noted we have integrated to date txi’s aggregates operations and are in the process of fully integrating txi’s ready mixed concrete and cement operations later this year we believe we will be successful in this integration process nevertheless we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition with txi if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 aggregatesrelated downstream businesses have lower profit margins and can be more volatile 

for 2014 our asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses accounted for 30 of the net sales of our aggregates business up from 8 in 2011 these businesses typically provide lower profit margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry therefore as we expand these operations our overall gross margin is likely to be adversely affected we saw this impact our gross margins in recent years however in 2014 heritage aggregatesrelated downstream operations gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues increased 450 basis points reflecting increased ready mixed concrete volumes and pricing as well as higher asphalt shipments the overall gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our aggregatesrelated downstream operations 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2011 increases in energy costs when compared with 2010 lowered net earnings for our businesses by 027 per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices in 2012 while the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 5 higher compared to 2011 this was offset by a decline of 25 from 2011 on our average cost for natural gas this trend reversed in 2013 when the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4 lower compared to 2012 but the average cost of natural gas increased 18 from 2012 similarly in 2014 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 8 lower compared to 2013 but the average cost of natural gas increased 24 from 2013 diesel fuel which averaged 282 per gallon in 2014 and 

 

298 per gallon in 2013 represents the single largest component of energy costs for our aggregates business diesel fuel prices declined rapidly during december 2014 ending the year at a per gallon price that was 26 below the 2014 average 

the magnesia specialties business has fixed price agreements for the supply of a portion of its coal and natural gas needs the cement business has fixed price agreements for the supply of coal 

cement production requires large amounts of energy including electricity and fossil fuels energy costs represent approximately 31 of the production costs of our cement business therefore the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity could adversely affect us accordingly volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement business profitability of the cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made in 2014 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 133 million during the second half of the year 

similarly our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively these raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our aggregatesrelated downstream operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials we generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials for 2014 we saw higher prices for these raw materials than 2013 liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products eg oil or diesel fuel because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products 

cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility 

cement is a commodity and competition is often based mainly on price which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand prices change a lot in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand general economic conditions and other market conditions which we cannot control when cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand in that case cement prices generally fall we cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement business 

unexpected equipment failures catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 

our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment such as our kilns and finishing mills this equipment on occasion may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage during accidents in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our cement operations in california are also susceptible to damage from earthquakes for which we maintain only a limited amount of earthquake insurance and therefore we are not fully insured against earthquake risk we also have one to twoweek scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities in 2014 the cement business incurred shutdown costs of 133 million during the second half of the year in 2014 the magnesia specialties business incurred shutdown costs of 54 million during the year any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time 

 

our cement and magnesia specialties businesses may become capacity constrained 

if our cement or magnesia specialties businesses become capacity constrained they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for some of their products and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments we can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity increasing the operational availability of equipment reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment however we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity constrained in addition we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize

our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the us in violation of us fair trade laws 

the cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated us fair trade laws currently an antidumping order against cement and clinker from japan will expire in 2016 unless it is extended by the federal trade commission as has always been the case cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries such as those in latin america and asia which could compete with domestic producers in addition if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement an influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of us fair trade laws could adversely affect our cement business 

road paving construction operations present additional risks to our business 

our aggregatesrelated downstream operations also present challenges in the paving construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time or our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 118 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business 308 of the hourly employees of our cement business and 100 of the hourly employees of our magnesia specialties business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the oro grande california cement plant the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in june 2015 august 2015 and may 2018 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship we also rely heavily on thirdparty truck and rail transportation to ship coal natural gas and other fuels to our plants any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints high fuel costs and various hazards including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages in texas we compete for third party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2014 financial statements the federal regulatory body overseeing our accounting standards is now implementing a convergence project which would conform the accounting in the united states for various topics to the requirements under international accounting standards proposed changes are being issued one topic at a time we have not looked at how all of these topics might impact us new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002  and other related rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of corporate governance reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements and exposure to adverse findings by the pcaob of the work performed may increase as to internal controls 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels beyond the may 2015 expiration of map21 further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities like we did with the acquisition of txi in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the cyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our magnesia specialties business now runs near capacity so unexpected changes could affect its earnings 

because our magnesia specialties business essentially runs near capacity any unplanned changes in costs or customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment of our business 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or 

 

even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

 item 2 properties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2014 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 274 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 30 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands of which 109 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 56 are on land owned in part and leased in part 103 are on leased land and 5 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and exceed 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2014 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 134 properties in 5 states of which 111 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part 21 are on leased land and 1 is on a facility neither owned or leased where product is sold under an agreement 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable 

 

reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves the company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement business as it does for its aggregates business for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2014 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful the company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the company’s cement and magnesia specialties businesses 

 

  

     

  

 cement business 

as of december 31 2014 the company through its subsidiaries processed or shipped cement from 12 properties in 4 states of which 8 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 4 are on leased land the company’s cement business has production facilities located at two sites in texas and one in california midlothian texas south of dallasfort worth hunter texas between austin and san antonio and oro grande california near los angeles the following table summarizes certain information about the company’s cement manufacturing facilities at december 31 2014 

 

 reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 5579 acres of land owned by the company as of december 31 2014 the company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 933 million tons 

the company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns crushers preheaterscalciners coolers finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries these cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck 

 

as of december 31 2014 the company through its subsidiaries also operated 5 cement distribution terminals and 1 cement packaging facility 

magnesia specialties business 

the magnesia specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its five reportable business segments 

condition and utilization 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 

during 2014 the principal properties of the aggregates business were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however during the economic recession the company adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2014 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 398 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idling could continue the company expects however as the economy continues to recover it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 

during 2014 the texas cement plants were operating between 75 and 85 percent utilization and the california cement plant was operating in the low 70s percent utilization reflective of a slower recovery in the southern california construction economy the portland cement association “pca” anticipates california markets should reach a demandsupply equilibrium during 2016 the cement business’ leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency providing incremental supply for a soldout texas cement market and a road map for significantly improved profitability for 2015 and beyond significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns 

during 2014 the magnesia specialties business was essentially running near capacity at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the company expects future organic growth to result from increased pricing rationalization of the current product portfolio andor further cost reductions in the current operating environment any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the magnesia specialties segment

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend as of december 31 2014 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2014 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2014 as permitted by the securities and exchange commission management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls over certain assets and the net sales of the acquired cement and ready mixed concrete operations which are included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements and constituted 18 of consolidated total assets and 17 of consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual statement of financial responsibility and report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2014 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2014 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2014 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2014 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2014 annual report

 item 1 business tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the nation’s second largest producer of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel for the construction industry including infrastructure nonresidential residential railroad ballast agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications the company’s aggregates business also includes its verticallyintegrated operations ie asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving construction services the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2013 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 88 of the company’s consolidated net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 12 of the company’s consolidated net sales within the company’s aggregates business the aggregates products line accounted for 69 of consolidated 2013 net sales while the verticallyintegrated operations accounted for 19 of consolidated 2013 net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river and provided the company a shipping position from the bahamas smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the ohio river valley and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas additionally in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business these acquisitions increased the company’s ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

these transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions with the company completing over 70 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until the present which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

  

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased related to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port facility in port canaveral florida which serves the greater orlando market the secondlargest aggregatesconsuming area in florida the port canaveral acquisition the only developed deepwater aggregates import terminal located on florida’s central east coast was complemented by the company’s organic investment in 2010 in a new aggregates import facility at port manatee florida 

in 2011 the company acquired three aggregatesrelated businesses first it acquired the assets of an aggregates asphalt and ready mixed concrete business located in western san antonio texas next it exchanged certain assets with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado region in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river referred to herein as the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment finally the company acquired a privatelyheld ready mixed concrete business in the denver colorado area 

in 2013 the company acquired three aggregates quarries in the greater atlanta georgia area the transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced the company’s existing longterm position in this market 

between 2001 and 2011 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its specialty products segment in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2014 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

  

recent developments 

on january 27 2014 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with texas industries inc a delaware corporation “txi” and project holdings inc a north carolina corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company “merger sub” subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement merger sub will merge with and into txi with txi surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company herein referred to as the “proposed business combination with txi” pursuant to the merger agreement promptly after the effective time of the merger each outstanding share of txi common stock will be exchanged for 070 of a share of the company’s common stock the proposed business combination with txi was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both the company and txi 

the closing of the proposed business combination with txi is subject to customary closing conditions including among others the adoption of the merger agreement by txi’s stockholders approval by the company’s shareholders of the issuance of the company’s common stock in connection with the merger and expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended in addition the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both the company and txi and further provides for the payment of certain termination fees under certain specified circumstances the company currently anticipates the closing of the proposed business combination with txi to be in the second quarter of 2014 however the company cannot assure the closing of the proposed business combination with txi will occur by any particular date if at all 

certain of the risks and uncertainties relating to the company’s proposed business combination with txi are summarized under item ia risk factors of this form 10k in addition in connection with the proposed business combination with txi the company and txi intend to file relevant materials with the sec including a registration statement on form s4 that will include a joint proxy statement of the company and txi and that will also constitute a prospectus of the company for additional information regarding the proposed business combination with txi and the risks and uncertainties associated with it please see the joint proxy statementprospectus that will be included in the registration statement on form s4 as may be amended from time to time and the other relevant material that will be filed with the sec when they become available 

business segment information 

effective january 1 2013 the company reorganized the operations and management reporting structure of its aggregates business resulting in a change to its reportable business segments the company now conducts its aggregates business through three reportable segments the midamerica group southeast group and west group the company also has the specialty products segment which includes its magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2013 consolidated financial statements the “2013 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2013 annual report to shareholders the “2013 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

  

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations in arkansas colorado texas and wyoming 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2013 the company’s aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete from a network of nearly 300 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 30 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 17 billion and 1776 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 45 of its aggregates shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates shipments volume has ranged from 125 million tons to 130 million tons over the last four years reflecting a certain degree of volume stability albeit at historically low levels in a cyclical trough environment during 2013 the company’s overall aggregates shipments were relatively flat compared with 2012 levels prior to 2010 the economic recession resulted in unprecedented reductions in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments have also suffered as states continue to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues most state budgets began to improve in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits 

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector construction projects the current federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act  or map21 provides for infrastructure spending of approximately 40 billion per year but the bill expires on september 30 2014 recently the senate environment and public works committee chairman announced plans to advance a new multiyear surfacetransportation bill in april 2014 furthermore the federal government shutdown in october 2013 and the general uncertainty over governmental spending policy have reduced confidence in longterm funding beyond this september 2014 expiration of map21 as a result some states and municipalities are reluctant to commit to large scale multiyear infrastructure projects 

  

map21 also significantly expanded funding under the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act  or tifia tifia a us department of transportation alternative funding mechanism provides federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects under map21 tifia funding increases to 10 billion in fiscal 2014 the company believes that tifia could provide a substantial boost for state department of transportation construction programs well above what states have currently budgeted several of the company’s key states have applied for tifia awards including texas north carolina and florida on february 6 2014 texas received its first tifia award under map21 the first award approved in the company’s key geographic markets 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina colorado iowa and georgia account for 59 of total 2013 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates has led to improvements in profitability in the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern and midwestern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall flooding or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets for example the september 2013 flooding in the denver colorado area severely affected production and distribution in that market area in the second quarter of 2013 iowa had its wettest quarter in more than a century similarly many of our markets in georgia experienced rainfall during the second quarter of 2013 at levels twice the average levels these record levels of rainfall restricted production and shipments in several of the company’s midwestern and southeastern operations during the second quarter of 2013 subject to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses from time to time 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses 

  

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2013 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 77 by truck 18 by rail and 5 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of deepwater and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of rail and water movements occurs in the southeast group and the west group areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population growth and density the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in 2013 167 million tons of aggregates were sold from distribution yards results from these distribution operations lowered the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of the aggregates business by 240 basis points in 2013 the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of the aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins of the longhaul distribution network 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus part of its capital spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations in addition to capital projects for the aggregates business in 2011 the company initiated construction of a 53 million dolomitic lime kiln at its specialty products location in woodville ohio this project was completed in 2012 adding 275000 additional tons of capacity per year 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the 

  

southeast and west groups increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2013 the company did not incur any such charges however a charge is possible in 2014 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractuallystated minimums 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

from time to time we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products for example in texas competition with operations in the oil and gas fields for thirdparty trucking services constrains the availability of these services to us if there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation has slowed in the last several years as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declines during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company has focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets management anticipates the number of acquisition opportunities will increase as the economy recovers from the 

  

protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates operations these verticallyintegrated operations accounted for 22 of net sales of the aggregates business in 2013 these operations have lower gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than the company’s aggregates product line due to highly competitive market dynamics and minimal barriers to entry and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2013 prices for liquid asphalt and cement were lower than 2012 

the company continues to review carefully each of the acquired verticallyintegrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company also reviews other independent verticallyintegrated operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own verticallyintegrated operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments in 2011 the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included verticallyintegrated operations including asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets the proposed business combination with txi described under “ recent developments ” above is expected to further expand the company’s verticallyintegrated operations with the addition of txi’s cement and ready mixed concrete operations along with its aggregates operations 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be 

  

subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 168 million 205 million and 195 million during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2013 64 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 35 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials specialty products’ net sales increased to record levels in 2013 reflecting the woodville ohio dolomitic lime kiln expansion marketing initiatives in the chemicals business and solid pricing gains in key product lines 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2013 81 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 19 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products accounted for 48 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2013 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70 or greater steel utilization domestic capacity utilization averaged 77 in 2013 according to moody’s credit outlook steel production in 2014 is forecast to increase modestly over 2013 levels and average capacity utilization is expected to be between 75 and 80 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

  

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with specialty products 

in 2001 the specialty products business sold certain assets of its refractories business to a whollyowned subsidiary of minerals technologies inc in connection with the sale the business improved its cost structure through the write down of certain assets and the repositioning of the manistee michigan operating facility to focus on the production of chemical products the sale of the refractories business lessened the dependence of the specialty products business on the steel industry over time 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 11 of the revenues of the specialty products business in 2013 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 257 million 242 million and 240 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

in 2012 the company completed construction of a new dolomitic lime kiln for its specialty products business at woodville ohio the new dolomitic lime capacity is committed under a longterm contract and adds 275000 tons of capacity and 22 million to 25 million of annual net sales to the specialty products segment at comparable current margins 

  

patents and trademarks 

as of february 14 2014 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 37 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 77 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5600 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company’s verticallyintegrated operations are also characterized by numerous operators a national trade association estimates there are about 5500 ready mixed concrete plants in the united states owned by over 2200 companies with about 55000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete similarly a national trade association estimates there are about 3500 asphalt plants in the united states owned by over 800 companies the company in its aggregates business including its verticallyintegrated operations competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates industry some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for 11 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2013 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

  

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 126 million in 2013 and approximately 110 million in 2012 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 24 million in 2013 and are expected to be approximately 20 million in 2014 and 2015 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2013 and 2012 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break 

  

out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2013 financial statements and the 2013 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives – safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial 

  

statements” of the 2013 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2013 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2013 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the specialty products dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the specialty products segment of the business 

  

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties “prps” under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site the usepa has not designated the company as a prp the ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of prps and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time the company believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions on december 7 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases sometimes referred to as “ghg” or ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on may 13 2010 the usepa issued a final rule to impose additional permitting requirements on existing ghg sources emitting greater than 25000 metric tons per year of ghgs permitting requirements will be phased in over several years and apply to both new sources and modifications to existing facilities where ghgs increase and exceed certain specified thresholds the regulated facilities will be required to determine the best available control technology to control ghg emissions in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s specialty products business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the specialty products operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations will likely be subject to the new program the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs that will impact the company’s woodville and manistee operations the 

  

company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville operation or for magnesium hydroxide produced at the manistee operation would be passed on to its customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also analyzing the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business the overall united states economy moved at a tepid pace during 2013 economic and political uncertainty impeded significant growth during the year demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped or slowed bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the aggregates intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates during the past few years the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products the recent economic recession is an example and our business has been hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregates operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states of our aggregates business based on net sales by state of destination of texas north carolina colorado iowa and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

  

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry for the last four years our aggregates shipments ranged from 125 million tons to 130 million tons reflecting a certain degree of volume stability during 2013 our overall aggregates shipments were relatively flat compared with 2012 levels prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending during 2013 the uncertainty created by the federal government shutdown and the lack of a successor federal highway bill negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects this uncertainty was accompanied by a reduction in many states’ investment in highway maintenance 

in july 2012 the president signed into law the successor federal highway bill known as map21 which was designed to maintain highway spending at current annual levels of approximately 40 billion in funding for transportation infrastructure through fiscal 2014 map21 also greatly expands tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects to 750 million in fiscal 2013 and 1 billion in fiscal 2014 while the enactment of map21 resulted in an increase in infrastructure spending for a period of time map21 expires on september 30 2014 we are not clear when or in what form there might be a successor bill to map21 the recent federal government shutdown and the general uncertainty about governmental spending in general have also reduced confidence in longterm funding for transportation beyond the september 2014 expiration of map21 this uncertainty has caused some states and cities to cancel or defer large scale longterm construction projects which hurt infrastructure spending in 2013 our aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market decreased 7 in 2013 compared with 2012 after being flat in 2012 compared with 2011 we believe that the demand and need for infrastructure projects will support consistent growth in this market once longterm federal funding is resolved beyond 2014 in 2013 45 of our aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we also sell our aggregates products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall 

we experienced an 8 increase in aggregates shipments to the nonresidential construction market in 2013 with increased aggregates shipments in certain of our geographic markets to the commercial part of nonresidential construction namely office and retail during 2013 a strengthened residential market precipitated nonresidential construction activities to serve increased populations specifically the commercial component of nonresidential construction generally follows the residential construction market with a 12to18 month lag we expect continued stable aggregate shipments to the heavy industry component of nonresidential predominantly the energy sector shale field activity remains strong particularly at the eagle ford shale field in south texas and the marcellus field in pennsylvania we should benefit from shale energy investments particularly as additional shalerelated development moves into downstream projects such as public infrastructure and industrial building in 2013 31 of our aggregates shipments were to the nonresidential construction market we expect the nonresidential construction market to increase notably in 2014 

  

our aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 11 in 2013 housing strength varies considerably in different areas of the country we saw significant residential growth in our key geographic markets including colorado florida georgia and north carolina the us census bureau reported the total value of private residential construction put in place in 2013 increased 18 helped by further gains in multifamily housing and a strengthening singlefamily market furthermore housing permits and housing starts key indicators for residential construction activity continue to show yearoveryear improvement although starts are still below the 50year historical annual average of 15 million starts the us census bureau estimated 923000 housing units were started in 2013 up 183 with the rate of housing starts significantly exceeding completions the upward trend is expected to continue in 2014 with substantial expansion during the second half of the year according to mcgraw hill construction for the first time since 2007 total housing starts are estimated to exceed 1 million units in 2014 bringing the level of construction closer to the demographic demand for singlefamily housing in 2013 14 of our aggregates shipments were to the residential construction market 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of highcalcium carbonate material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales collectively “chemrockrail” accounted for 10 of our aggregates shipments and decreased 1 in 2013 this reduction was principally due to a decrease in agricultural lime shipments in 2013 because of wet weather ballast shipments were flat in 2013 compared with 2012 levels 

our aggregates business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects in 2013 congress provided virtually no increase in federal transportation investment for highway transit and runway construction which negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in 2012 map21 provides annual funding at current levels of approximately 40 billion through september 30 2014 with modest increases to reflect projected inflation map21 also greatly expands tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects to 1 billion in fiscal 2014 map21 is not subject to potential sequestration under current federal law tifia is also not subject to federal debt ceiling limits however authorized transfers from the general fund to the highway trust fund are subject to potential sequestration given the record level of national debt and the resulting pressure on all government spending we cannot be assured that congress will not take action that might impact map21 or tifia or that congress will pass a successor federal highway bill or will extend the provisions of the current bill when it expires in 2014 federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds 

  

are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past several years based on current spending and revenue trends the us department of transportation projects that the highway account one of the two components of the highway trust fund will be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner before september 30 2014 the same time map21 expires therefore timely congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund and to enact a longerterm federal highway bill we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states have experienced statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina was among the states experiencing these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits most state budgets including north carolina began to improve in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits states have also taken on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment we anticipate further growth in statelevel funding initiatives such as bond issues toll roads and special purpose taxes as states address infrastructure needs particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty nevertheless it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal state and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the production and shipment levels for the company’s aggregates business including all of its verticallyintegrated operations vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

  

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

  

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold some underperforming and other nonstrategic assets 

we have provided under the initial heading “ recent developments ” under item i of this form 10k a description of our proposed business combination with txi the merger agreement with txi requires us to pay subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement the entire purchase price in the proposed business combination with txi with shares of our common stock which would dilute the ownership interests of our current shareholders see “risk factors relating to the proposed business combination with txi” for certain of the risks and uncertainties related to our proposed business combination with txi 

verticallyintegrated businesses have lower profit margins and can be more volatile 

for 2013 our asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses accounted for about 22 of the net sales of our aggregates business up from 20 in 2012 and 8 in 2011 these businesses typically provide lower profit margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs highly competitive market dynamics and minimal barriers to entry therefore as we expand these operations our gross margins are likely to be adversely affected the mix of verticallyintegrated operations lowered the gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business by 260 basis points in 2013 the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our verticallyintegrated operations 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2011 increases in energy costs when compared with 2010 lowered net earnings for our businesses by 027 per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices in 2012 while the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 5 higher compared to 2011 this was offset by a decline of 25 from 2011 on our average cost for natural gas this trend reversed in 2013 when the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4 lower compared to 2012 but the average cost of natural gas increased 18 from 2012 the specialty products business has fixed price agreements for the supply of a portion of its coal and natural gas needs in 2014 

  

similarly our verticallyintegrated operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mix concrete respectively these raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our verticallyintegrated operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials 2012 saw continued volatility in the costs for these raw materials for 2013 however we saw lower prices for these raw materials than 2012 

road paving construction operations present additional risks to our business 

our verticallyintegrated operations also present challenges in the paving construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time or our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations these risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

  

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 163 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 100 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2015 and june 2014 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of 

  

our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively we urge you to read about our accounting policies in note a of our 2013 financial statements the federal regulatory body overseeing our accounting standards is now implementing a convergence project which would conform the accounting in the united states for various topics to the requirements under international accounting standards proposed changes are being issued one topic at a time we have not looked at how all of these topics might impact us new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002  and other related rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of corporate governance reports from the public company accounting oversight board’s “pcaob” inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits the company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements and exposure to adverse findings by the pcaob of the work performed may increase as to internal controls 

  

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

we have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the company’s business demand for aggregates products particularly in the infrastructure construction market has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels beyond the september 2014 expiration of map21 further delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty 

a recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this construction downturn which can negatively affect operating cash flows historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during the economic downturn we have temporarily idled some of our facilities in 2013 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 507 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve such temporary idling could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the idling period the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary idlings when temporarily idled locations reopen we may incur additional repair costs for a temporary period nevertheless there is a risk of longterm asset impairment at sites that are temporarily idled if the economic downturn does not improve in the near term 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

  

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

on january 28 2014 moody’s investors service announced it was placing our credit ratings under review for downgrade as a result of our announcement of the proposed business combination with txi similarly on the same day standard  poor’s ratings services placed our credit ratings on their creditwatch with negative implications because of the proposed transaction on the other hand on january 29 2014 fitch ratings after reviewing the proposed transaction reaffirmed our credit rating outlook as stable while we do not believe that a review by moody’s or standard  poor’s should result in a reduction of our credit ratings there is no guarantee of such outcome 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our specialty products business now runs at capacity so unexpected changes could affect its earnings 

because our specialty products business essentially runs at capacity any unplanned changes in costs or customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment of our business 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

risk factors relating to proposed business combination with txi 

we have provided under the initial heading “ recent developments ” under item i of this annual report on form 10k a description of our proposed business combination with txi the proposed business combination with txi presents risks and uncertainties that should be considered by someone purchasing or considering the purchase of our securities some of these risks have been described in connection with the discussion of various general risks described above other risk factors relating to our proposed business combination with txi are discussed below the following discussion is not intended as a substitute for the discussion of the proposed transaction contained in our joint proxy statementprospectus used in connection with our proposed business combination with txi for further information regarding the proposed business combination with txi including additional risks and uncertainties related thereto please review the joint proxy statementprospectus that will be included in the registration statement on form s4 that the company intends to file with the sec as may be amended from time to time as well as the company’s other disclosures relating to the proposed business combination with txi when they become available see also “important additional information” under item 9b of this form 10k below 

  

the proposed business combination with txi is subject to approval by the company’s shareholders and txi’s stockholders and our ability to complete the proposed business combination with txi is subject to the receipt of antitrust clearance from governmental entities which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or txi or cause us to abandon the proposed business combination with txi 

in order for the proposed business combination with txi to be completed txi stockholders must approve the adoption of the merger agreement and the company’s shareholders must approve the issuance of the company’s common stock to txi stockholders in connection with the merger in addition we are unable to complete the proposed business combination with txi until after the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended expires or is terminated and certain other conditions in the merger agreement are satisfied or if legally permitted waived in deciding whether to terminate the antitrust waiting period or allow it to expire the antitrust division of the department of justice the “doj” which is reviewing the proposed business combination with txi will consider the effect of the proposed business combination with txi on competition within the relevant markets the doj may seek a court order enjoining the proposed business combination with txi or may seek an agreement from us imposing certain requirements or obligations as conditions for not seeking an injunction or otherwise challenging the proposed business combination with txi and allowing the expiration of the antitrust waiting period the merger agreement requires us to accept certain conditions from regulators that could adversely impact the company without us having the right to refuse to close the proposed business combination with txi on the basis of those regulatory conditions we can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary antitrust clearance and that any required conditions will not have a material adverse effect on us following the proposed business combination with txi in addition we can provide no assurance that the regulatory review process or the regulatory conditions will not result in a delay or the abandonment of the proposed business combination with txi 

failure to complete the proposed business combination with txi could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

if the proposed business combination with txi is not completed our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks including 

 

  

  

   

 in each case without realizing any of the benefits of having the proposed business combination with txi completed in addition if the proposed business combination with txi is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our respective customers and employees we could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed business combination with txi or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if the proposed business combination with txi is not completed we can provide no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect our business financial results and stock price 

any delay in completing the proposed business combination with txi may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the transaction 

in addition to the required regulatory clearance and the shareholder and stockholder approvals described above the proposed business combination with txi is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion we cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the proposed business combination with txi for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring any delay in completing the proposed business combination with txi could cause us not to realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the proposed business combination with txi is successfully completed within its expected time frame 

the pendency of and uncertainties associated with the proposed business combination with txi could adversely affect our business and operations 

in connection with the pending proposed business combination with txi some customers suppliers and other entities with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer decisions which could negatively impact our revenues earnings and cash flows as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the proposed business combination with txi is completed in addition current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the company following the closing of the proposed business combination with txi which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the proposed business combination with txi no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of the company or following the closing of the proposed business combination with txi txi 

the proposed business combination with txi will involve substantial costs 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the proposed business combination with txi including debt refinancing costs costs relating to change in control agreements at txi fees and expenses payable to financial advisors other professional fees and expenses insurance premium costs fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices sec filing fees printing and mailing costs and other transactionrelated costs fees and 

  

expenses in addition we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business policies procedures operations technologies and systems of txi with those of the company while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and revenue synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the proposed business combination with txi these integration expenses likely will result in our taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the proposed business combination with txi but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

following the proposed business combination with txi we may be unable to integrate the company and txi successfully and realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination with txi 

the proposed business combination with txi involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination with txi if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition we and txi have operated and until the completion of the proposed business combination with txi will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the diversion of each company’s management’s attention the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination with txi or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the proposed business combination with txi 

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the proposed business combination with txi for a number of reasons including the unsuccessful integration of the company and txi including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor or our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the proposed business combination with txi including financial results as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts these factors are to some extent beyond our control 

the proposed business combination with txi may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently anticipate that the proposed business combination with txi will be accretive to earnings per share in 2014 assuming refinancing of txi’s outstanding debt at or around the closing of the proposed business combination with txi and excluding onetime costs this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change we could also encounter additional transactionrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the proposed business combination with txi all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed business combination with txi and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the proposed business combination with txi 

following the proposed business combination with txi the size of the business of the company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either the company’s or txi’s current businesses in addition we may continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage our expanded business which may pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected economies of scale cost savings revenue synergies and other benefits currently anticipated from the proposed business combination with txi or anticipated from any additional acquisitions or strategic transactions 

  

our current shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the company after the closing of the proposed business combination with txi and will exercise less influence over the company’s management 

our current shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors and other matters affecting the company immediately after the proposed business combination with txi is completed it is expected that our current shareholders will own approximately 69 of our common stock and current txi stockholders will own approximately 31 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of the proposed business combination with txi our current shareholders will have less influence on our management and policies than they now have

 item 2 properties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2013 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 260 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 30 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 94 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 57 are on land owned in part and leased in part 103 are on leased land and 6 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and exceed 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2013 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 39 properties in 4 states of which 26 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part 11 are on leased land and 1 is on a facility neither owned or leased where product is sold under an agreement 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

  

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information – critical accounting policies and estimates – property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2013 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful 

  

  

     

  

 specialty products business 

the specialty products business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its four reportable business segments 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used during 2013 the principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 60 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however due to the current economic recession the company has adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2013 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 507 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idlings could continue the company expects however as the economy recovers it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases

water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel based upon currentlyavailable facts it is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation and other proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the company’s operations its cash flows or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its operating segments

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend as of december 31 2013 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2013 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2013 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance 

  

that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual statement of financial responsibility and report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2013 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2013 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2013 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2013 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2013 annual report

 item 1 business tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the nation’s second largest producer of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel for the construction industry including infrastructure nonresidential residential railroad ballast agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications the company’s aggregates business also includes asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving operations the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2012 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 89 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 11 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

  

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence in georgia and tennessee particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased relates to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port facility in port canaveral florida which serves the greater orlando market the secondlargest aggregatesconsuming area in florida the port canaveral acquisition the only developed deepwater aggregates import terminal located on florida’s central east coast was complemented by the company’s organic investment in 2010 in a new aggregates import facility at port manatee florida 

in 2011 the company acquired three aggregatesrelated businesses first it acquired the assets of an aggregates asphalt and ready mixed concrete business located in western san antonio texas next it exchanged certain assets with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado region in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river referred to herein as the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment finally the company acquired a privatelyheld ready mixed concrete business in the denver colorado area 

between 2001 and 2011 the company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its specialty products segment in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2013 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

in 2012 the company operated in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group collectively the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings 

  

from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2012 consolidated financial statements the “2012 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2012 annual report to shareholders the “2012 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations in arkansas colorado and texas 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2012 the company’s aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete from a network of approximately 300 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 33 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 16 billion and 1435 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 51 of its heritage aggregates shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates shipments volume has ranged from 125 million tons to 130 million tons over the last three years reflecting a certain degree of volume stability albeit at low historical levels in a cyclical trough environment during 2012 the company experienced some volume recovery in certain of its markets as overall aggregates shipments increased 26 from 2011 levels the company’s heritage aggregates shipments increased 29 in 2012 compared with 2011 heritage aggregates shipments exclude tonnage from acquisitions that were not included in prioryear operations for a full year and exclude divestitures prior to 2010 the economic recession resulted in unprecedented reductions in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments have also suffered as states continue to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues 

  

the federal highway bill provides annual funding for publicsector construction projects on july 6 2012 the president signed into law the new federal highway bill moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act  or map21 effective october 1 2012 map21 along with the actions of the company’s key states to utilize various funding alternatives to support important infrastructure jobs should provide an impetus for increased infrastructure spending in 2013 and beyond map21 maintains highway expenditures at current levels approximately 40 billion per year through september 30 2014 with modest increases to reflect projected inflation 

map21 also significantly expands funding under the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act  or tifia tifia a us department of transportation alternative funding mechanism provides federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface transportation projects under map21 tifia funding increases from 122 million per year to 750 million for fiscal 2013 and 10 billion in fiscal 2014 the company believes that tifia could provide a substantial boost for state department of transportation construction programs well above what states have currently budgeted additionally tifia incremental construction dollars exceed the total stimulus dollars awarded by the us department of transportation under the prior federal highway bill which expired on december 31 2012 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina iowa colorado and georgia account for 57 of total 2012 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time recent improvements in the national economy and in some of the states in which the company operates has led to improvements in the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states operations in the denver colorado market increase the company’s exposure to winter weather and risk of losses in the first and fourth quarters excessive rainfall flooding or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets for example in 2011 several midwest states including iowa indiana and ohio recorded the wettest april in more than a century these record levels of rainfall led to the flooding of the mississippi river in april and may restricting production and shipments in several of the company’s south central operations near the end of 2011 however the company divested most of these south central operations to lafarge as part of the river district operations additionally in 2011 record snowfall in the rocky mountains and nearrecord spring rainfall triggered flooding of the missouri river interrupting the company’s operations in iowa nebraska missouri and kansas due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years 

  

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2012 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 75 by truck 19 by rail and 6 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of water and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population trends the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus a significant part of its capital growth spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port operation in port canaveral florida that serves the greater orlando market in 2011 the company opened an aggregates sales yard near tampa florida adding to its raildistribution network and serving the tampa and lakeland florida markets in addition to capital projects for the aggregates business in 2011 the company initiated construction of a 53 million dolomitic lime kiln at its specialty products location in woodville ohio this project was completed in 2012 adding 275000 additional tons of capacity per year 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

  

the water and rail distribution network initially resulted in the company increasing its market share in certain areas however recent consolidation in the aggregates industry has made it more competitive for the company in various parts of the country the company believes that as shipment volumes recover the company will increase its market share in those areas 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2012 the company incurred a 24 million expense due to not shipping the minimum tonnages similar charges are possible in 2013 if shipment volumes do not increase 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not 

  

satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation has slowed in the last several years as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declines during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company has focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets management anticipates the number of acquisition opportunities to increase as a result of the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these verticallyintegrated operations accounted for 20 of net sales of the aggregates business in 2012 increasing from 8 of net sales in 2011 the company more than doubled its exposure to vertical integration with its december 2011 acquisition of several operations in colorado these operations have lower gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues than the company’s aggregates product line and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates business liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete respectively therefore fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the company’s operating results during 2012 prices for liquid asphalt and cement were volatile 

the company has continued to review carefully each of the acquired verticallyintegrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company has also reviewed other independent verticallyintegrated operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own verticallyintegrated operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments in 2011 the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included verticallyintegrated operations including asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company 

  

does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 164 million 175 million and 170 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2012 71 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 28 to lime and 1 to stone sold as construction materials overall net sales in the specialty products business increased in 2012 reflecting growth in both magnesia chemicals sales and dolomitic lime shipments to the steel industry as well as increased sales from the new capacity generated from the completion of the new lime kiln in woodville ohio described in more detail below 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2012 approximately 73 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 27 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 46 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2012 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors in 2012 us steel production increased 3 over 2011 and domestic capacity utilization averaged 75 although the steel industry is performing better than the economy as a whole production levels remain below the 100 millionton mark exceeded in each year between 2002 through 2008 during these seven years the average capacity utilization rate was 97 average capacity utilization is expected to rise but not reach 80 on average in 2013 

  

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with specialty products 

in 2001 the specialty products business sold certain assets of its refractories business to a whollyowned subsidiary of minerals technologies inc in connection with the sale the business improved its cost structure through the write down of certain assets and the repositioning of the manistee michigan operating facility to focus on the production of chemical products the sale of the refractories business lessened the dependence of the specialty products business on the steel industry over time 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 11 of the revenues of the specialty products business in 2012 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 202 million 242 million and 171 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

in 2012 the company completed construction of a new dolomitic lime kiln for its specialty products business at woodville ohio the new dolomitic lime capacity is committed under a longterm contract and adds 275000 tons of capacity and 22 million to 25 million of annual net sales to 

  

the specialty products segment at comparable current margins the new kiln which became functional on november 1 2012 generated 31 million of net sales during 2012 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 15 2013 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 87 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 106 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5600 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels rail and river barges have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 11 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2012 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

  

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 110 million in 2012 and approximately 105 million in 2011 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 40 million in 2012 and are expected to be approximately 20 million in 2013 and 2014 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2012 and 2011 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar 

  

that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2012 financial statements and the 2012 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives – safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2012 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2012 

  

annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2012 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the specialty products dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program because the enforcement proceeding is in its initial stage the company cannot at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the specialty products segment of the business 

  

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties prps under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site the usepa has not designated the company as a prp the ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of prps and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time the company believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions on december 7 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases sometimes referred to as “ghg” or ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on may 13 2010 the usepa issued a final rule to impose additional permitting requirements on existing ghg sources emitting greater than 25000 metric tons per year of ghgs permitting requirements will be phased in over several years and apply to both new sources and modifications to existing facilities where ghgs increase and exceed certain specified thresholds the regulated facilities will be required to determine the best available control technology to control ghg emissions in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s specialty products business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the specialty products operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations will likely be subject to the new program the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs that will impact the company’s woodville and manistee operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations 

  

at the woodville operation or for magnesium hydroxide produced at the manistee operation would be passed on to its customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also analyzing the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

employees 

as of january 31 2013 the company has 4948 employees of which 3681 are hourly employees and 1267 are salaried employees included among these employees are 717 hourly employees represented by labor unions 145 of the company’s employees of such amount 128 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while 100 of the specialty products segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the specialty products business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2015 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2014 while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at either location the company added a net increase of 463 employees directly related to the acquisitions it completed in 2011

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business the overall united states economy began showing signs of stability during 2012 but economic and political uncertainty impeded significant growth while we were encouraged by an increase in our aggregates shipments in 2012 compared with 2011 demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped or slowed bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the aggregates intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products the recent economic recession is an example and our business has been hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregates operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five salesgenerating states based on net sales by state of destination of texas north carolina iowa colorado and georgia our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry for the last three years our aggregates shipments ranged from 125 million tons to 130 million tons reflecting a certain degree of volume stability our aggregates volumes increased 26 in 2012 after decreasing 38 in 2011 our heritage aggregates shipments increased 29 in 2012 over 

  

2011 we determine our heritage aggregates volume by excluding tonnage from operations we acquired during the year that were not included in previous year operations and excluding operations we divested during the year prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending during 2012 the uncertainty created by the lack of a successor federal highway bill negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects this uncertainty was accompanied by a reduction in many states’ investment in highway maintenance 

in july 2012 the president signed into law the successor federal highway bill known as map21 which was designed to maintain highway spending at current annual levels of approximately 40 billion in funding for transportation infrastructure through fiscal 2014 map21 also greatly expands tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects to 750 million in fiscal 2013 and 1 billion in fiscal 2014 while the enactment of map21 resulted in an increase in infrastructure spending during the fourth quarter of 2012 we cannot be assured of the full impact of map21 while tifia funding should greatly boost state road construction programs well above their current construction budgets we cannot be assured of the full impact of tifia funding nevertheless we believe that the enactment of map21 along with the actions of some of our key states to use various funding alternatives to support important infrastructure jobs should lead to increased infrastructure spending in 2013 and later years we cannot be assured however of the impact of congressional debate on federal funding of infrastructure spending andor possible congressional action that might impact map21 andor tifia provisions 

weakness in the united states economy and uncertainty in longterm federal infrastructure spending until the passage of map21 hurt infrastructure spending in 2012 while the overall economy began showing signs of stability in 2012 economic and political uncertainty impeded significant growth infrastructure spending improved in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the passage of map21 our heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market were flat in 2012 after decreasing 5 in 2011 we remain optimistic that the demand and need for infrastructure projects support consistent growth in this market now that longterm federal funding is resolved through 2014 in 2012 51 of our heritage aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregates products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall 

we experienced a 10 increase in heritage aggregates shipments to the nonresidential construction market in 2012 with increased shipments to the energy sector compared with 2011 driven by lower natural gas prices and the ongoing shale field activity at the eagle ford shale field in south texas this increase was accompanied by growth in heritage aggregates shipments in certain of our geographic markets to the commercial part of nonresidential construction namely office and retail which generally follows the residential construction market with a 12to18 month lag we expect this component of the nonresidential construction market to experience modest volume recovery in 2013 in 2012 30 of our heritage aggregates shipments were to the nonresidential construction market 

  

our heritage aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 14 in 2012 the us census reported the total value of private residential construction put in place in 2012 increased 17 housing strength varies considerably in different areas of the country we saw relative strength in some of our markets particularly texas and colorado while this trend is encouraging housing starts are still below the historical annual average of 15 million starts the us census estimated 780000 housing units were started in 2012 the recovery in housing is expected to continue in 2013 with substantial expansion during the second half of the year according to mcgraw hill construction by 2015 housing starts are estimated to be 1 million per year bringing the level of construction closer to the demographic demand for singlefamily housing in 2012 8 of our heritage aggregates shipments were to the residential construction market 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of high calcium carbonate material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales “chemrockrail” accounted for 11 of our heritage aggregates shipments and decreased 9 in 2012 this reduction was principally due to the comparison with 2011 when ballast shipments increased to repair rail lines after the missouri river flooding in the midwestern united states and a decline in both current coal traffic on railroads as well as railroad maintenance while ballast shipments were lower compared with 2011 volumes for 2012 were in line with the fiveyear historical average three of our top ten customers in 2012 were class i railroads we expect our chemrockrail shipments to be relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012 

our aggregates business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways streets roads bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in 2012 map21 provided annual funding at current levels of approximately 40 billion through september 30 2014 with modest increases to reflect projected inflation map21 also greatly expands tifia funding a federal alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects to 750 million in fiscal 2013 and 1 billion in fiscal 2014 map21 is not subject to potential sequestration under current federal law tifia is also not subject to federal debt ceiling limits nevertheless given the record level of national debt and the resulting pressure on all government spending we cannot be assured that congress will not take action that might impact map21 or tifia or that congress will pass a successor federal highway bill or will extend the provisions of the current bill when it expires in 2014 federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific 

  

programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past three years presently the congressional budget office projects that the highway account one of the two components of the highway trust fund will be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner sometime during fiscal 2015 we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business many states have been experiencing statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina is among the states experiencing these pressures and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits the situation is improving however 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather 

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable operations in the denver colorado area increase the company’s exposure to winter weather and risk of losses in the first and fourth quarters 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to 

  

transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold some underperforming and other nonstrategic assets 

  

we have doubled our exposure to verticallyintegrated businesses in the last year 

our acquisitions in texas and colorado in december of 2011 more than doubled our exposure to downstream businesses for 2012 our asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses accounted for about 20 of the net sales of our aggregates business up from 8 in 2011 we obtain lower margins excluding freight and delivery revenues from these operations as compared with our aggregates product line therefore as we expand these operations our gross margins are likely to be adversely affected the mix of verticallyintegrated operations lowered the gross margins excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business by about 260 basis points in 2012 the gross margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of our aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our verticallyintegrated operations 

short supplies and high costs of fuel energy and raw materials affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2011 increases in energy costs when compared with 2010 lowered net earnings for our businesses by 027 per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices in 2012 while the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 5 higher compared to 2011 this was offset by a decline of 25 from 2011 on our average cost for natural gas the specialty products business has fixed price agreements for the supply of coal and about 25 of its natural gas needs in 2013 

similarly our verticallyintegrated operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mix concrete respectively these raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control the financial results of our verticallyintegrated operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials 2012 saw continued volatility in the costs for these raw materials 

road paving construction operations present additional risks to our business 

our verticallyintegrated operations also present challenges in the paving construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion in some instances including many of our fixed price contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay generally in the form of contractually agreedupon liquidated damages under these circumstances the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project in our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors 

  

beyond our control which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time or our original bid these same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 128 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 100 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2015 and june 2014 respectively 

  

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations 

the availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

when we sold our river district operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with lafarge we sold most of our barge longhaul distribution network as a result we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges especially along the mississippi river we still distribute some of our product by barge along rivers in west virginia we may continue to experience to a lesser degree risks associated with distributing our products by barges including significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes how we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about 

  

our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2012 financial statements the federal regulatory body overseeing our accounting standards is now implementing a convergence project which would conform the accounting in the united states for various topics to the requirements under international accounting standards proposed changes are being issued one topic at a time we have not looked at how all of these topics might impact us new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations to capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending without continued economic stimulus at the federal level 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during the economic downturn we have temporarily idled some of our facilities in 2012 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 509 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve such temporary idling could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the idling period the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it 

  

elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary idlings nevertheless there is a risk of longterm asset impairment at sites that are temporarily idled if the economic downturn does not improve in the near term 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the economic downturn has caused a significant decline in steel manufacturing while steelmaking increased in 2012 it is still far below levels of the past we anticipate this weakness to continue in 2013 the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our specialty products business now runs at capacity so unexpected changes could affect its earnings 

because our specialty products business currently runs at capacity any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment of our business 

  

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not 

  

approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

 item 2 properties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2012 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 259 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 34 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 97 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 55 are on land owned in part and leased in part 102 are on leased land and 5 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and exceed 100 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2012 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 41 properties in 5 states of which 26 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part and 14 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information – critical accounting policies and estimates – property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2012 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

  

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful 

  

  

     

 specialty products business 

the specialty products business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its four reportable business segments 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used during 2012 the principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 50 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however due to the current economic recession the company has adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2012 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 509 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idlings could continue the company expects however as the economy recovers it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend as of december 31 2012 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2012 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2012 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or 

  

procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2012 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2012 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2012 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2012 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2012 annual report

 item 1 business tableend general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading producer of aggregates products crushed stone sand and gravel for the construction industry including infrastructure nonresidential residential railroad ballast agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications the company’s aggregates business also includes asphalt products ready mixed concrete and road paving materials the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2011 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 87 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 13 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

  

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence in georgia and tennessee particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased relates to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port facility in port canaveral florida which serves the greater orlando market the secondlargest aggregatesconsuming area in florida the port canaveral acquisition the only developed deepwater aggregates import terminal located on florida’s central east coast was complemented by the company’s organic investment in 2010 in a new aggregates import facility at port manatee florida 

in 2011 the company acquired three aggregatesrelated businesses first it acquired the assets of an aggregates asphalt and ready mixed concrete business located in western san antonio texas next it exchanged certain assets with lafarge north america inc “lafarge” pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan denver colorado region in exchange for which lafarge received properties consisting of quarries an asphalt plant and distribution yards operated by the company along the mississippi river referred to herein as the company’s “river district operations” and a cash payment finally the company acquired a privatelyheld ready mixed concrete business in the denver colorado area 

between 2001 and 2011 the company disposed of or permanently shut down a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its specialty products segment in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2012 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

recent developments 

on december 12 2011 the company proposed a business combination with vulcan that would create a usbased company that would be the global leader in construction aggregates hereinafter referred to as “proposed business combination with vulcan” the proposed business combination with vulcan would be effected through a stockforstock taxfree transaction in which each outstanding share of vulcan common stock will be exchanged for 050 of a share of the company’s 

  

common stock together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights on december 12 2011 the company commenced an exchange offer for all of the outstanding shares of vulcan common stock at the same exchange ratio the proposed business combination with vulcan and the exchange offer has the unanimous support of the company’s board of directors the offer represents a premium for vulcan shareholders of 15 to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for vulcan and the company during the 10day period ended december 9 2011 the trading day before the commencement of the offer and 18 to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for vulcan and the company during the 30day period ended december 9 2011 if all shares of vulcan common stock are exchanged pursuant to the offer former vulcan shareholders would own in the aggregate approximately 58 of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock based on the proposed exchange ratio the company also intends to maintain the dividend for the combined company at the company’s current rate of 160 per share annually or the equivalent of 080 per vulcan share annually based on the proposed exchange ratio 

in furtherance of the proposed business combination with vulcan the company submitted notice to vulcan of its intention to nominate five independent director candidates for election to vulcan’s board of directors at vulcan’s 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and filed a preliminary proxy statement and amendments thereto with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” in connection with the proposal the company’s nominees if elected would replace the vulcan directors whose terms are scheduled to expire in 2012 the company intends to file a definitive proxy statement and when completed the company’s definitive proxy statement and accompanying proxy card will be mailed to vulcan shareholders

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2011 inclusive of 63 million tons attributable to operations divested during the year the company’s aggregates business shipped 1251 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands for continuing operations the business shipped 1188 million tons of aggregates generating net sales and earnings from operations of 13 billion and 1275 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 54 of its heritage aggregates shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the company’s aggregates shipments volume has ranged from 123 million tons to 130 million tons over the last three years reflecting a certain degree of volume stability in a cyclical trough environment overall aggregates shipments declined 38 in 2011 after a 54 increase in 2010 in aggregates shipments over 2009 levels representing the company’s first year of volume growth since 2005 the company’s heritage aggregates shipments declined 35 in 2011 compared to 2010 heritage aggregates shipments exclude tonnage from acquisitions that were not included in prioryear operations for a full year and divestitures prior to 2010 the ongoing economic recession had resulted in unprecedented reductions in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments have also suffered as states continue to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal economic stimulus plan signed into law in february 2009 provided approximately 286 billion of additional funding for highways roads bridges and airports through 2012 however the lack of shovelready projects delayed the impact of arra on the aggregates industry as of december 31 2011 approximately 15 of arra infrastructure funds remain and by law must be spent in 2012 based on its market positions the company estimates that it has supplied approximately 6 to 8 of 

  

aggregates required for projects funded by arra and will supply approximately the same percentage amounts in 2012 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 304 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina iowa georgia and south carolina account for approximately 57 of total 2011 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time the economic recession nationally and in these states has negatively impacted the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states furthermore mild winter weather conditions typically do not result in increased firstquarter shipments as contractors cannot costeffectively mobilize and demobilize equipment and manpower during the winter months the recent acquisitions of operations in the denver colorado market increased the company’s exposure to winter weather and risk of losses in the first and fourth quarters excessive rainfall or severe drought however can jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets for example in 2011 several midwest states including iowa indiana and ohio recorded the wettest april in more than a century these record levels of rainfall led to the flooding of the mississippi river in april and may restricting production and shipments in several of the company’s south central operations near the end of 2011 however we divested most of these south central operations to lafarge as part of the river district operations additionally in 2011 record snowfall in the rocky mountains and nearrecord spring rainfall triggered flooding of the missouri river interrupting the company’s operations in iowa nebraska missouri and kansas due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are typically the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity most notably in august september and october and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

  

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2011 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 70 by truck 20 by rail and 10 by water excluding the aggregates shipments from the river district operations which were divested in 2011 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments in 2011 was 72 by truck 21 by rail and 7 by water although the company divested its river district operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with lafarge the development of water and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the company’s strategic growth plan while the river district operations were being serviced as part of the company’s barge longhaul distribution network those divested operations were not in highgrowth states the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group areas which generally lack a longterm indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit aboveaverage growth characteristics driven by longterm population trends the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus a significant part of its capital growth spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port operation in port canaveral florida that serves the greater orlando market in 2011 the company opened an aggregates sales yard near tampa florida adding to its raildistribution network and serving the tampa and lakeland florida markets in addition to capital projects for the aggregates business in 2011 the company initiated construction of a 53 million dolomitic lime kiln at its specialty products location in woodville ohio which is expected to add over 275000 additional tons of capacity per year this project is expected to be completed in late 2012 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

the water and rail distribution network initially resulted in the company increasing its market share in certain areas however recent consolidation in the aggregates industry has made it more competitive for the company in various parts of the country the company believes that as shipment volumes recover the company will increase its market share in those areas 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water internal freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports 

  

aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs ship or barge availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2011 the company incurred a 03 million expense due to not shipping the minimum tonnages similar charges are possible in 2012 if shipment volumes do not increase 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships and barges should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized industry consolidation has slowed in the last several years as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declines during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company has focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets management anticipates the number of acquisition opportunities to increase as a result of the protracted recession opportunities include public and larger private familyowned businesses as well as asset divestitures 

  

from companies rationalizing noncore assets and repairing financiallyconstrained balanced sheets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 8 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2011 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such in the past they have not represented core businesses of the company the results of these operations have traditionally been insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company has continued to review carefully each of the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities the company has also reviewed other independent vertically integrated operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the company either as part of their own vertically integrated operations or operations that might be vertically integrated with other operations owned by the company based on these assessments in 2011 the company completed the acquisitions described under general above which included vertically integrated operations including asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving businesses in the denver colorado and san antonio texas markets vertically integrated operations are expected to have a more significant impact on the results of the company in future periods 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order 

  

backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 175 million 170 million and 198 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2011 71 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 28 to lime and 1 to stone overall net sales in the specialty products business increased in 2011 reflecting growth in both magnesia chemicals sales and dolomitic lime shipments to the steel industry 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2011 approximately 72 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 28 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 46 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2011 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors in 2011 steelmaking rates in the united states improved 8 over 2010 driven by growth from the auto energy and heavy equipment manufacturing segments production rates for steel were approximately 75 in 2011 up from 70 in 2010 of domestic steelmaking capacity according to fitch ratings steel demand is expected to continue to grow but not reach full recovery until 2013 at the earliest additionally average capacity utilization is expected to rise but not reach 80 on average in 2012 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

  

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with specialty products 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 11 of the revenues of the specialty products business in 2011 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim so no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 242 million 171 million and 162 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

the company is currently constructing a new dolomitic lime kiln for its specialty products business at woodville ohio the new dolomitic lime capacity is committed under a longterm contract and is expected to add over 275000 tons of capacity and 22 million to 25 million of annual net sales to the specialty products segment at comparable current margins when completed in late 2012 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 29 2012 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 98 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 107 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private 

  

industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5500 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels rail and river barges have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 11 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2011 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the amounts spent by the company in each of the last two years on research and development activities were not considered material 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

  

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 105 million in 2011 and approximately 91 million in 2010 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 14 million in 2011 and are expected to be approximately 10 million in 2012 and 2013 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2011 and 2010 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

  

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2011 financial statements and the 2011 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2011 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2011 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2011 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

  

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal clean air act “caa” as part of the industry wide effort the usepa issued notices of violationfindings of violation “novs” to the company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the company’s compliance with the caa new source review “nsr” program at the specialty products dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in woodville ohio the company has been providing information to the usepa in response to these novs and has had several meetings with the usepa the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the nsr program because the enforcement proceeding is in its initial stage at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or required upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required the company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the specialty products segment of the business 

in the vicinity of and beneath the specialty products facility in manistee michigan there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the usepa on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the usepa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company’s whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an 

  

administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

in september 2005 the usepa designated several entities as potentially responsible parties prps under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla at the ward transformer superfund site located in raleigh north carolina in april 2009 two prps filed separate actions in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against more than 100 other entities including the company seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site the usepa has not designated the company as a prp the ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of prps and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time the company believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions on december 7 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases sometimes referred to as “ghg” or ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on may 13 2010 the usepa issued a final rule to impose additional permitting requirements on existing ghg sources emitting greater than 25000 metric tons per year of ghgs permitting requirements will be phased in over several years and apply to both new sources and modifications to existing facilities where ghgs increase and exceed certain specified thresholds the regulated facilities will be required to determine the best available control technology to control ghg emissions in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

  

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s specialty products business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the specialty products operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations will likely be subject to the new program the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs that will impact the company’s woodville and manistee operations the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville operation or for magnesium hydroxide produced at the manistee operation would be passed on to its customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company is also analyzing the obligations of our manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

employees 

as of january 31 2012 the company has approximately 4993 employees of which 3709 are hourly employees and 1284 are salaried employees included among these employees are 768 hourly employees represented by labor unions 150 of the company’s employees of such amount 152 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while 100 of the specialty products segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the specialty products business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2015 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2014 while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at either location the company added a net increase of approximately 463 employees directly related to the acquisitions it completed in 2011

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business the overall united states economy remains weak with national debt at a record high and commercial and consumer credit availability remaining tight while we were encouraged by an increase in our aggregates shipments in 2010 the first year of volume growth since 2005 2011 saw volume drop off again as our overall aggregates shipments declined 38 over 2010 levels with heritage aggregates shipments declining 35 over 2010 levels as discussed in more detail below demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could continue to fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped or slowed bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the aggregates intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products the recent economic recession is an example and our business has been hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregates operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of texas north carolina iowa georgia and south carolina our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

  

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry for the last three years our aggregates shipments ranged from 123 million tons to 130 million tons reflecting a certain degree of volume stability our aggregates volumes decreased 38 in 2011 after a 54 increase in 2010 in shipments over 2009 levels representing our first year of volume growth since 2005 our heritage aggregates shipments decreased 35 in 2011 over 2010 we determine our heritage aggregates volume by excluding tonnage from operations we acquired during the year that were not included in previous year operations and operations we divested during the year prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending the current uncertainty created by the lack of a successor federal highway bill has negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects there has been a reduction in many states’ investment in highway maintenance 

in february 2009 president obama signed into law an economic stimulus plan which was designed to stimulate the economy by providing over 29 billion in new funding for transportation infrastructure however the lack of shovelready projects and the substitution of stimulus funds for other projects delayed and limited the impact of this stimulus spending on the aggregates industry at the end of 2011 only about 15 of these infrastructure funds remained which by law must be spent in 2012 we cannot be assured of the remaining impact of the stimulus plan 

weakness in the united states economy and uncertainty in longterm federal infrastructure spending hurt infrastructure spending in 2011 the federal stimulus plan is also winding down as all stimulus projects must be completed by the end of 2012 our heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market decreased 5 in 2011 we remain optimistic that the demand and need for infrastructure projects support consistent growth in this market once longterm federal funding is resolved approximately 54 of our heritage aggregates shipments in 2011 were to the infrastructure construction market 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregates products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions historical merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting lack of credit availability 

we experienced a 3 decrease in heritage aggregates shipments to the nonresidential construction market in 2011 with shipments to the energy sector to support natural gas drilling and exploration projects reduced in part because of lower natural gas prices these reductions were offset in part by growth in heritage aggregates shipments to the commercial part of nonresidential construction namely office and retail which generally follows the residential construction market with a 12to18 month lag we expect this component of the nonresidential construction market to experience modest volume recovery in 2012 approximately 26 of our heritage aggregates shipments in 2011 were to the nonresidential construction market 

  

our heritage aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 4 in 2011 while the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate at 0 throughout the year overall weakness in the us economy and reduced consumer lending by banks limited the impact of this low rate the excess supply of developed lots also stifled new housing starts and limited the more aggregatesintensive subdivision development typically seen in a residential volume recovery although we expect moderate improvement in the residential construction market in 2012 housing starts are not expected to achieve a normalized level estimated at 15 million starts nationally until 2016 according to mcgraw hill construction approximately 8 of our heritage aggregates shipments in 2011 were to the residential construction market 

consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan would increase our exposure to unfavorable conditions in the residential construction market vulcan’s sales and volumes in arizona florida and california have been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a decline in residential construction vulcan’s sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until there is a recovery in residential construction 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales “chemrockrail” accounted for approximately 12 of our heritage aggregates shipments and decreased slightly in 2011 three of our top ten customers in 2011 were class i railroads we expect our chemrockrail shipments to be relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 

our aggregates business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in 2005 provided funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs but ended september 30 2009 while a multiyear successor federal highway bill has not been approved congress has extended the provisions of the current law under eight continuing resolutions through march 31 2012 given the record level of national debt and the resulting pressure on all government spending we cannot be assured that congress will pass a multiyear successor federal highway bill or will continue to extend the provisions of the most recent law at the same levels historically states have been reluctant to commit to longterm projects while under continuing resolutions in fact obligations for federal highway funds are at a fiveyear low through the first three months of the federal fiscal year ending september 30 2012 and 106 billion less than were obligated during the first three months of fiscal 2011 when the highway bill was also operating under continuing resolutions 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular 

  

programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past three years presently the congressional budget office projects that the highway account one of the two components of the highway trust fund will be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner sometime during fiscal 2012 or 2013 we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business nearly all states are now experiencing statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina and texas are among the states experiencing these pressures and these states disproportionately affect our revenues and profits 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather 

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable the recent acquisitions of operations in the denver colorado market increased the company’s exposure to winter weather and risk of losses in the first and fourth quarters 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral 

  

reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

  

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

we have provided under the initial heading “ recent developments ” under item i of this annual report on form 10k a description of our proposed business combination with vulcan as presently proposed we would pay the entire purchase price of the proposed business combination with vulcan with shares of our common stock which would dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders we believe however the proposed business combination with vulcan would maximize longterm shareholder value see “risk factors relating to the proposed business combination with vulcan” 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2011 increases in energy costs when compared with 2010 lowered net earnings for our businesses by 027 per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to 

  

hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 152 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 100 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2015 and june 2014 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail ship or barge any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2017 and generally contain renewal 

  

options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes how we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2009 we were required under new accounting standards to determine whether instruments granted in stockbased payment transactions under our employee benefit plans were considered “participating securities” and included in determining our earnings per share this resulted in a reduction of our previouslyreported net earnings and decreased our previouslyreported earnings per share amounts we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2011 financial statements the federal regulatory body overseeing our accounting standards is now implementing a convergence project which would conform the accounting in the united states for various topics to the requirements under international accounting standards proposed changes are being issued one topic at a time we have not looked at how all of these topics might impact us new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

  

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations to capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending without continued economic stimulus at the federal level 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during this economic downturn we have been forced to temporarily idle some of our facilities in 2011 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 559 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve such temporary idling could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the idling period the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary idlings nevertheless there is a risk of longterm asset impairment at sites that are temporarily idled if the economic downturn does not improve in the near term 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing in 2011 the company entered into a new multiyear credit facility and amended its accounts credit facility with its banks it used the proceeds from the new credit facility to repay maturing obligations prepay other obligations fund working capital and other general corporate purposes in addition in 2012 it amended its leverage ratio covenant under such new credit facility and accounts credit facility to ensure that the impact of business development costs for the proposed business combination with vulcan and the seasonal working capital requirements for the newlyacquired colorado operations do not impair liquidity available under such credit facilities there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to complete the proposed business combination with vulcan or to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings 

  

downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at an investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the economic downturn has caused a significant decline in steel manufacturing while steelmaking increased in 2011 it is still far below levels of the past we anticipate this weakness to continue in 2012 the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our acquisitions could harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best 

  

interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

  

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 

we are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

the exchange ratio of the proposed business combination with vulcan is fixed and will not be adjusted 

each outstanding share of vulcan common stock will be exchanged for the right to receive 050 shares of our common stock together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights upon consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan this exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted including in the event of any increase in the price of our common stock or a decrease in the price of vulcan common stock in certain circumstances vulcan shareholders could receive more value for their shares in the proposed business combination than the value calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the offer was announced because the proposed business combination with vulcan may not be completed until certain conditions have been satisfied or waived a significant period of time may pass between the commencement of the offer and the time that we accept shares of vulcan common stock for exchange 

  

we have not negotiated the price or terms of the proposed business combination with vulcan with vulcan’s board of directors 

we have not negotiated the price or terms of the proposed business combination with vulcan or its board of directors neither vulcan nor its board of directors has approved the proposed business combination with vulcan in response to the commencement of our offer on december 12 2011 vulcan filed with the sec on december 22 2011 its schedule 14d9 reporting that vulcan’s board of directors had determined to recommend that vulcan shareholders reject our exchange offer and not tender their shares of vulcan common stock to us 

in connection with the proposed business combination with vulcan we have only conducted a review of vulcan’s publicly available information and have not had access to vulcan’s nonpublic information therefore we may be subject to unknown liabilities of vulcan which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and results of operations if the proposed business combination with vulcan is completed 

while we are in the same industry with vulcan to date we have only conducted a due diligence review of vulcan’s publicly available information in connection with the proposed business combination with vulcan the consummation of the offer may constitute a default or an event that with or without notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default or result in the termination cancellation acceleration or other change of any right or obligation including without limitation any payment obligation under agreements of vulcan that are not publicly available as a result after the consummation of the offer we may be subject to unknown liabilities of vulcan which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

uncertainties exist in integrating our business and operations with that of vulcan and there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the business combination will be realized 

we intend to the extent possible to integrate vulcan’s operations with our operations although we believe that the integration of our operations with that of vulcan and the resulting benefits and synergies will be achievable there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties integrating vulcan’s operations with our operations which could result in our achieving less than the anticipated benefits and synergies of the combination and therefore less than the expected cost savings additionally there can be no assurance that the timing for realizing these benefits and synergies will be consistent with the timing we anticipate the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 also our proposal is not dependent upon the retention or cooperation of vulcan’s senior management there can be no assurance that there will not be some lack of cooperation on the part of vulcan’s senior executive management andor its other employees which could adversely affect the integration process 

the payment of cash dividends by the combined company in the future may be subject to certain limitations the failure of the combined company to maintain or pay dividends may adversely affect its share price 

we intend for the combined company to pay regular dividends to shareholders at our current rate of 160 per share annually equivalent to 080 per vulcan share annually based on the 050 exchange ratio the ability of the combined company to pay dividends is subject to among other things its financial condition compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness including vulcan’s indebtedness and applicable law in addition if vulcan is required to offer to repurchase outstanding senior unsecured notes its financial condition may be adversely affected and as a result the combined company could be required to reduce or eliminate its dividend please see “following consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan the credit rating of vulcan’s indebtedness could be downgraded which in certain circumstances could give rise to an obligation to redeem vulcan’s existing indebtedness” if the combined company reduces or eliminates its dividend the combined company’s share price may be adversely affected 

we must obtain governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the proposed business combination with vulcan which if delayed not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions may jeopardize or delay the offer result in additional expenditures of money and resources andor reduce the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination with vulcan 

the proposed business combination with vulcan is conditioned on the receipt of all necessary or advisable at our sole discretion governmental and regulatory authorizations consents orders and approvals or the termination of any necessary or advisable at our sole discretion waiting periods including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the federal antitrust laws if we do not receive these approvals or do not receive them on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in our proposed offer then we will not be obligated to accept shares of vulcan common stock for exchange in the offer 

the governmental agencies from which we are seeking these approvals or which may otherwise review the transaction including in particular the ftc and the united states department of justice have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations as a condition to their approval of the proposed transaction agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the combination contemplated by the proposed combination further no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the offer will be satisfied and if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions to the consummation of the offer are satisfied no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and 

  

timing of the approvals if we agree to any material requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the offer these requirements limitations additional costs or restrictions could adversely affect our ability to integrate the operations of the two companies or reduce the anticipated benefits of the proposed combination this could result in a failure to complete the proposed business combination with vulcan or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company 

although there is some overlap in some regions served by vulcan and us we believe that such overlap is limited and that there would be numerous parties interested in purchasing any assets required to be divested we expect that any asset divestitures that may be required in connection with the proposed business combination with vulcan would not present significant hurdles to completion of a transaction 

the market for our common stock may be adversely affected by the issuance of shares pursuant to the proposed business combination with vulcan 

in connection with the completion of the proposed business combination with vulcan we estimate we will issue approximately 64905000 shares of our common stock the increase in the number of shares of our common stock may lead to sales of such stock or the perception that such sales may occur either of which may adversely affect the market for and the market price of our common stock 

if all shares of vulcan common stock are exchanged pursuant to the offer former vulcan shareholders would own in the aggregate approximately 58 of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock based on the proposed exchange ratio 

following consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan the credit rating of vulcan’s indebtedness could be downgraded which in certain circumstances could give rise to an obligation to redeem vulcan’s existing indebtedness 

vulcan had approximately 28 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes as of september 30 2011 we do not presently intend to redeem or refinance any of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes in connection with the proposed business combination with vulcan 

completion of the proposed business combination with vulcan may constitute a “change of control” under the terms of each series of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes if completion of the offer constitutes a change of control and if there is a downgrade of the credit rating of any series of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes by both sp and moody’s to a rating that in the case of sp is below bbb and in the case of moody’s investors service inc is below baa3 in each case regardless of the credit rating prior to the downgrade during the period commencing 60 days prior to the first public announcement by vulcan of any change of control or pending change of control continuing until 60 days following consummation of such change of control which period will be extended following consummation of a change of control for up to an additional 60 days for so long as either of these rating agencies has publicly announced that it is considering a possible ratings change this would constitute a “change of control repurchase event” under the terms of the applicable notes in the event of a change of control repurchase event with respect to any series of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes vulcan would be required to offer to repurchase each holder’s notes of such series at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

we may elect to implement alternative structures to effect the proposed business combination with vulcan taking into account among other things any implications of the proposed transaction under vulcan’s senior unsecured notes pursuant to the terms of the form merger agreement delivered to vulcan concurrently with martin marietta’s business combination proposal we would have the right to require that prior to the closing of the transaction vulcan cooperate with us and as applicable amend the merger agreement to implement the transactions through an alternative transaction structure under the terms of the form merger agreement we can request that vulcan implement the transaction either i through a new holding company we form or ii as may otherwise be requested by us so long as vulcan’s shareholders receive the substantially equivalent economic benefit compared to the economic benefit vulcan’s shareholders would have received upon consummation of the transactions under the structure contemplated by the form merger agreement 

we are not currently considering any alternative structures other than a transaction through a newly formed holding company this holding company structure would not constitute a change of control of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes however it is possible that a holding company structure may have other implications with respect to vulcan us andor the combined company including in certain circumstances potentially requiring an offer to repurchase certain of the company’s existing debt as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 550 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes under the terms of which a holding company or other alternative transaction structure may constitute a “change of control” if completion of the offer constitutes a change of control and if there is a downgrade of the credit rating of any series of the company’s senior unsecured notes by sp and moody’s or in the case of the 660 senior notes due 2018 by at least two of fitch inc sp and moody’s to a rating below “investment grade” regardless of whether the rating prior to such downgrade was investment grade or below investment grade prior to 60 days following consummation of the change of control which period may be extended for so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade and in the case of the 625 senior notes due 2037 if either sp or moody’s publicly announces or informs the trustee in writing that such downgrade was the result in whole or in part of any event or circumstance relating to the change of control we would be required to offer to repurchase each holder’s notes of such series at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest although no assurance can be given as to the terms or availability of refinancing capital and no new financing commitments have been entered into as of the date of this annual report we currently expect that any repurchase or refinancing of the company’s senior unsecured notes if required could be funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under new andor existing financing arrangements except as described above we do not expect that the consummation of the transactions through a newly formed holding company structure will result in any material adverse consequences relative to the transaction structure described above 

if following the completion of the proposed business combination with vulcan vulcan is obligated to offer to repurchase vulcan’s outstanding senior unsecured notes we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to repurchase or refinance vulcan’s outstanding senior unsecured notes in these circumstances failure to repurchase the notes as required would result in an event of default under the terms of the notes which could put vulcan in default under agreements governing its other indebtedness including the acceleration of the payment of any borrowings thereunder and may have an adverse effect on the value of our stock and the ability of the combined company to maintain the dividend we expect it to pay since august 2010 the credit rating of vulcan’s senior unsecured notes 

  

has been downgraded three times by moody’s and two times by sp prior to our december 12 2011 announcement of the proposed business combination with vulcan both moody’s and sp had a “negative” credit outlook for vulcan since the announcement of our proposal moody’s has placed vulcan’s rating “under review direction uncertain” and sp has placed vulcan on “creditwatch positive” our offer is not conditioned on our having adequate funding to repurchase notes of vulcan or our notes in the event such repurchase obligations are triggered by the consummation of the offer or any alternative transaction structure 

on december 15 2011 vulcan entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement providing for a 600 million asset based lending credit facility with suntrust bank as administrative agent and the lenders and other parties thereto consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan may result in a default under vulcan’s new 600 million credit agreement unless the requisite lenders thereunder consent to such transaction in connection with the consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan we expect to replace vulcan’s 600 million credit agreement as well as our existing 600 million credit agreement dated march 31 2011 and our existing 100 million accounts receivable facility dated april 21 2009 and refinance any amounts outstanding under such credit facilities as of december 31 2011 approximately 385 million was outstanding under our credit facilities no assurance can be given as to the terms or availability of refinancing capital 

the combination of vulcan’s business with our business may result in one or more ratings organizations taking actions which may adversely affect the combined company’s business financial condition and operating results as well as the market price of our common shares 

ratings with respect to financial strength are important factors in maintaining customer confidence in our company and our ability to market our products and compete with other construction materials companies rating organizations regularly analyze the financial performance and condition of companies and will likely reevaluate our ratings following the consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan although sp or moody’s may not take any formal action with respect to modifying our ratings or vulcan’s ratings following the announcement of the proposed transaction following the closing of the transaction any ratings downgrades or the potential for ratings downgrades could adversely affect our ability to market and distribute products and services and successfully compete in the marketplace which could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company and the market value of shares of our common stock after the combination of our business with that of vulcan 

additionally if a ratings downgrade were to occur in connection with the proposed transaction or we fail to maintain an investment grade rating we could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive covenants which would reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility 

the proposed business combination with vulcan will trigger certain provisions contained in our employee benefit plans or agreements that will require us to make change of control payments or permit a counterparty to an agreement with us to terminate that agreement in addition the proposed business combination with vulcan could trigger certain provisions contained in vulcan’s employee benefit plans or agreements that could require vulcan to make change in control payments or permit a counterparty to an agreement with vulcan to terminate that agreement 

  

certain of our employee benefit plans and agreements have change of control provisions that will be triggered with respect to our executive officers in connection with the proposed business combination with vulcan following consummation of the secondstep merger with vulcan following the offer any vesting conditions applicable to any restricted stock units and any incentive stock plan units payable in shares of our common stock granted pursuant to our stock plans will lapse and any unvested options to acquire our common stock will become vested this will impact awards previously granted to our executive officers our nonemployee directors do not hold any unvested equity awards we have entered into employment protection agreements with each of the executive officers pursuant to which each executive officer would receive certain severance payments and an enhanced benefit under the martin marietta supplemental benefit plan “serp” upon certain terminations of employment following a “change of control” as defined in the agreements and the serp pursuant to the agreements as originally executed the executive would be entitled to receive the payments and benefits described below if within the twoyear period following a change of control the executive was terminated other than for “cause” as defined in the agreements or “disability” as defined in the agreements or the executive terminated his or her employment with “good reason” as defined in the agreements or if the executive terminated his or her employment for any reason during the 30day period following the second anniversary of a change of control however on december 15 2011 we entered into a letter agreement with each such executive pursuant to which the executive agreed to waive his or her right to receive any compensation or benefits to which he or she would be entitled under the agreements and any enhanced change of control benefits under the serp if the executive officer terminates his or her employment without “good reason” during the 30day period following the second anniversary of the consummation of the proposed business combination with vulcan including as such proposed transaction may be modified except with respect to the waiver of such rights the executive officers remain entitled to their rights under the employment protection agreements and the serp in circumstances involving a change of control 

if a qualifying termination occurs within two years following a change of control we are obligated to pay the executive in a lump sum an amount equal to three times the sum of the executive’s base salary annual bonus and perquisites the executive will also receive a prorated portion of his or her target annual bonus as defined in the agreements in addition for three years following termination of employment we must provide the executive with welfare benefits that are generally as favorable as those the executive enjoyed prior to the change of control we must also pay to the executive a lump sum equal to the sum of i the matching contributions that we would have made to the martin marietta performance sharing plan on behalf of the executive had the executive remained an employee for three years following termination of employment assuming the executive contributed the maximum amount of elective deferrals permissible and ii the additional amount the executive would have received as a benefit under the martin marietta pension plan for salaried employees the “retirement plan” had the executive remained an employee for three years following termination of employment we must also provide the executive with the same retiree medical benefits that were in effect for retirees immediately prior to the change of control and the executive shall be treated as if he or she had attained age 55 prior to termination of employment furthermore the agreements provide for “gross up” payments to compensate the executives for any golden parachute excise taxes imposed under the internal revenue code if the total payments or distributions to be made to the executive exceed the maximum dollar amount that would be payable to the executive without any excise tax by more than 50000 each executive officer also participates in the serp which provides that upon a termination of the executive’s employment that qualifies for severance benefits 

  

under the executive’s employment protection agreement for purposes of determining the serp benefit the benefit that would have been paid under the retirement plan but for the limitations of sections 401a17 and 415 of the internal revenue code shall be determined by taking into account i the amount of the executive’s lump sum payment under such executive’s employment protection agreement and ii three additional years of credited service such additional years of credited service shall be taken into account for vesting purposes under the serp in addition there shall be no reduction for benefit commencement prior to age 65 and as early as age 55 on the net benefit after reduction for the payment under the retirement plan payable under the serp the lump sum payment under the employment protection agreement shall be taken into account by dividing the amount of the lump sum payment by three and by treating the participant as having additional pensionable earnings for the purpose of determining the participant’s finalaverage pensionable earnings equal to such amount for a number of three additional calendar years moreover such additional calendar years shall extend the number of calendar years taken into account in determining finalaverage pensionable earnings the executive shall receive a cash lump sum payment as of his or her earliest retirement date age 55 or current age if older based on the mortality table determined as of the executive’s date of termination of employment and based on an interest rate of 00 

certain of vulcan’s employee benefit plans or agreements contain change in control clauses providing for compensation to be granted to certain members of vulcan senior management either upon a change in control or if following a change in control vulcan terminates the employment relationship between vulcan and these employees or if these employees terminate the employment relationship for good reason as defined in the applicable plan or agreement if successful the proposed business combination with vulcan could constitute a change in control of vulcan thereby giving rise to potential change in control payments because we have not had the opportunity to review vulcan’s nonpublic information in connection with the offer there may be other agreements that require payments or permit a counterparty to terminate an agreement because the proposed business combination with vulcan would cause a default or violate an antiassignment change in control or similar clause if this happens we may have to seek to replace that agreement with a new agreement we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace a terminated agreement on comparable terms or at all depending on the importance of a terminated agreement to vulcan’s business failure to replace that agreement on similar terms or at all may increase the costs to us of operating vulcan’s business or prevent us from operating part or all of vulcan’s business

 item 2 properties tableend aggregates business 

as of december 31 2011 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 264 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 28 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 97 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 57 are on land owned in part and leased in part 105 are on leased land and 5 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and exceed 101 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2011 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor 

  

asphalt products from 40 properties in 5 states of which 26 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part and 13 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information  critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2011 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend as of december 31 2011 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting as permitted by the sec the company’s management excluded its newlyacquired denver operations from its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 these denver operations accounted for approximately 7 of the company’s consolidated total assets at december 31 2011 based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2011 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2011 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will 

  

succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2011 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2011 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2011 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2011 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2011 annual report

 item 1 business 

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure agricultural nonresidential and residential the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2010 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 89 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 11 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the acquired 

locations significantly expanded the company’s presence in georgia and tennessee particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased relates to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

in 2010 the company acquired a deepwater port facility in port canaveral florida which serves the greater orlando market the secondlargest aggregatesconsuming area in florida the port canaveral acquisition the only developed deepwater aggregates import terminal located on florida’s central east coast was complemented by the company’s organic investment in 2010 in a new aggregates import facility at port manatee florida 

between 2001 and 2010 the company disposed of or permanently shut down a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its specialty products segment in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2011 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group collectively the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales gross profit earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2010 consolidated financial statements the “2010 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2010 annual report to shareholders the “2010 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure nonresidential and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these 

businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2010 the company’s aggregates business shipped 130 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 30 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 14 billion and 1666 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 55 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the 54 increase in 2010 in aggregates shipments over 2009 levels represented the company’s first year of volume growth since 2005 prior to 2010 the ongoing economic recession had resulted in unprecedented declines in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from peak volumes in 2006 aggregates shipments have also suffered as states continue to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal economic stimulus plan signed into law in february 2009 provided approximately 286 billion of additional funding for highways roads bridges and airports through 2012 however the lack of shovelready projects has delayed the impact of arra on the aggregates industry the company expects approximately 30 of arrarelated jobs in the company’s critical states will be completed in 2011 any carryover in 2012 by law must be completed that year based on its market position the company estimates that it has and will continue to supply approximately 6 to 8 of aggregates required for projects funded by arra 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 284 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 30 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina georgia iowa and louisiana account for approximately 55 of total 2010 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time the economic recession nationally and in these states has negatively impacted the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more 

severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall or severe drought however can jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2010 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 68 by truck 21 by rail and 11 by water the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group the company has an extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in recent years the company has brought additional capacity on line at its bahamas and nova scotia locations to transport materials via oceangoing ships 

during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus a significant part of its capital growth spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

the water and rail distribution network initially resulted in the company increasing its market share in certain areas however recent consolidation in the aggregates industry has made it more 

competitive for the company in various parts of the country the company believes that as shipment volumes recover the company will increase its market share in those areas 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement it must still pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2010 the company incurred a 14 million expense due to not shipping the minimum tonnages similar charges are possible in 2011 if shipment volumes do not increase 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized management expects a 

slowing in the industry consolidation trend as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declines during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company has focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 7 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2010 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company the results of these operations are currently insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 170 million 198 million and 248 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2010 68 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 31 to lime and 1 to stone overall net sales in the specialty products business increased in 2010 reflecting growth in both magnesia chemicals sales and dolomitic lime shipments to the steel industry 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2010 approximately 80 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 20 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 46 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2010 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors in 2010 steelmaking rates in the united states improved 37 over 2009 driven by inventory restocking improved automotive manufacturing and a slowly improving general economy however production rates for steel were approximately 70 of domestic steelmaking capacity making 2010 along with 2009 some of the lowest steel production rates in decades the company anticipates small to moderate growth in domestic steelmaking in 2011 with the growth attributable to continued gains in consumer confidence 

management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct 

own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline in 2010 dow sold the assets of dow’s facility in ludington michigan to occidental chemical corporation “occidental” and assigned to occidental its interests in the longterm processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with specialty products 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 9 of the revenues of the specialty products business in 2010 were from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim so no single foreign country accounted for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 171 million 162 million and 243 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 25 2011 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 109 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 107 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 5400 companies in the united states that produce construction aggregates these include active crushed stone companies and active sand and gravel companies the largest ten producers account for approximately 35 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels river barges and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 9 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2010 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2010 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the company spent approximately 02 million in 2010 04 million in 2009 and 06 million in 2008 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 91 million in 2010 and approximately 87 million in 2009 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including 

those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 30 million in 2010 and are expected to be approximately 3 million in 2011 and 2012 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2010 and 2009 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2010 financial statements and the 2010 annual report the company is generally required by state or 

local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2010 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2010 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2010 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in the vicinity of and beneath the specialty products facility in manistee michigan there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company’s whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions on december 7 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases sometimes referred to as “ghg” or ghgs” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six ghgs are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as of 2010 facilities that emitted 25000 metric tons or more per year of ghgs are required to annually report ghg generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on may 13 2010 the usepa issued a final rule to impose additional permitting requirements on existing ghg sources emitting greater than 25000 metric tons per year of ghgs permitting requirements will be phased in over several years and apply to both new sources and modifications to existing facilities where ghgs increase and exceed certain specified thresholds the regulated facilities will have to determine the best available control technology to control ghg emissions in congress both the house and senate had considered climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are 

below the cap another approach that had been proposed was a tax on emissions however the company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the usepa using its rulemaking authority various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of ghg emissions most of the ghg emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the manufacturing operations of the company’s specialty products business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime the specialty products operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products both of these operations are filing annual reports of their ghg emissions in accordance with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule if and when congress passes legislation on ghgs the woodville and manistee operations will likely be subject to the new program also the company believes that the usepa may impose additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of ghgs from its woodville and manistee operations however the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to ghg emission limitations at the woodville operation would be passed on to its customers the magnesium oxide products produced at the manistee operation compete against other products which emit a lower level of ghgs in their production therefore the manistee facility may have to absorb extra costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs might be the fastest growing part of the business is magnesium hydroxide however and the company believes its market competition will be similarly regulated under the ghg legislation and regulations the manistee facility sells materials to distributors and customers in a number of countries in asia europe and south america and to canada and mexico the company is analyzing the obligations of our global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords 

employees 

as of january 31 2011 the company has approximately 4471 employees of which 3284 are hourly employees and 1187 are salaried employees included among these employees are 625 hourly employees represented by labor unions 140 of the company’s employees of such amount 129 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while 100 of the specialty products segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the specialty products business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2011 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2014 while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at the manistee location this year or at the woodville location in 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual 

results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “will” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business the overall united states economy remains weak with national debt at a record high while we were encouraged by an increase in our aggregates shipments in 2010 the first year of volume growth since 2005 demand for our products particularly in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the aggregates intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products the recent economic recession is an example and our business has been hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of texas north carolina georgia 

iowa and louisiana our profitability will decrease we experienced this situation with the recent economic recession 

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry our 54 increase in aggregates shipments in 2010 was our first year of volume growth since 2005 prior to 2010 use of aggregate products in the united states had declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 while historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest ratesensitive than private sector spending the current uncertainty created by the lack of a successor federal highway bill has negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects there has been a reduction in many states’ investment in highway maintenance 

in february 2009 president obama signed into law an economic stimulus plan which was designed to stimulate the economy by providing over 29 billion in new funding for transportation infrastructure however the lack of shovelready projects and the substitution of stimulus funds for other projects has both delayed and limited the impact of this stimulus spending on the aggregates industry stimulus spending in four of the top seven states based on sales of our aggregates business lag the national average we expect approximately 30 of stimulusrelated jobs in our critical states will be completed in 2011 with any carryover in 2012 the last year of the stimulus plan spending we cannot be assured of the full impact of the stimulus plan 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregate products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions historical merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting lack of credit availability 

we experienced an 8 increase in shipments to the nonresidential construction market in 2010 with growth driven by shipments to the energy sector to support natural gas drilling and exploration projects however other components of the nonresidential construction market remained weak in 2010 and were negatively affected by continued weakness in the residential construction market the commercial part of nonresidential construction generally follows the residential construction market with a 12to18 month lag we expect this component of the nonresidential construction market to experience modest volume recovery in 2011 approximately 26 of our aggregates shipments in 2010 were to the nonresidential construction market 

our shipments to the residential construction market increased 5 in 2010 while the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate at 0 throughout the year overall weakness in the us economy and reduced consumer lending by banks limited the impact of this low rate the excess supply of developed lots also stifled new housing starts although we expect moderate improvement in the residential construction market in 2011 housing starts are not expected to achieve a normalized level estimated at 15 million starts nationally until 2013 approximately 7 of our aggregates shipments in 2010 were to the residential construction market 

shipments of chemical rock comprised primarily of material used for agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization and ballast product sales “chemrockrail” increased 5 in 2010 primarily due to increased railroad industry demand three of our top ten customers in 2010 were railroads we expect our chemrockrail shipments to be relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010 

our aggregates business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal state and local sources 

our aggregates products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects 

the federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for publicsector construction projects the most recent federal highway bill passed in 2005 provided funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs but ended september 30 2009 while a multiyear successor federal highway bill has not been approved congress has extended the provisions of the current law under continuing resolutions through march 4 2011 given the record level of national debt and the resulting pressure on all government spending we cannot be assured that congress will pass a multiyear successor federal highway bill or will continue to extend the provisions of the most recent law at the same levels historically states have been reluctant to commit to longterm projects while under continuing resolutions in fact obligations for federal highway funds are at a fiveyear low through the first half of the fiscal year ending june 30 2011 

federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts each year an appropriation act is passed establishing the amount that can actually be used for particular programs the annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund once the annual appropriation is passed funds are distributed to each state based on formulas apportionments or other procedures allocations apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation the highway trust fund has experienced shortfalls in recent years due to high gas prices fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency these shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels in response to the projected shortfalls money has been transferred from the general fund into the highway trust fund over the past three years presently the congressional budget office projects that the highway account one of the two components of the highway trust fund will be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner sometime during 2012 we cannot be assured of the existence timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future 

at the state level each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business nearly all states are now experiencing statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina and texas are among 

the states experiencing these pressures and these states disproportionately affect our revenues and profits 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors erratic weather patterns seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material particularly by barge adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies restrict production and limit movement of barge traffic the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2008 increases in energy costs when compared with 2007 prices lowered net earnings for our businesses by 065 per diluted share conversely in 2009 decreases in energy 

costs compared with 2008 prices contributed 101 to our net earnings per diluted share but in 2010 increases in energy costs compared with 2009 prices again lowered net earnings for our businesses by 034 per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 129 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 100 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for 

employees of our magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant expire in august 2011 and june 2014 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2005 and partially in 2006 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeastern region of the united states in 2005 and 2006 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes how we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we were required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this resulted in a reduction of our earnings and made comparisons between financial periods more difficult beginning in 2009 we were required under new accounting standards to determine whether instruments granted in stockbased payment transactions under our employee benefit plans were considered “participating securities” and included in determining our earnings per share this resulted in a reduction of our previouslyreported net earnings and decreased our previouslyreported earnings per share amounts we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2009 financial statements the federal regulatory body overseeing our accounting standards is now implementing a convergence project which would confirm the accounting in the united states for various topics to the requirements under international accounting standards proposed changes are being issued one topic at a time we have not looked at how all of these topics might impact us new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations to capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending without continued economic stimulus at the federal level 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn historically our bad debt writeoffs have 

not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during this economic downturn we have been forced to temporarily idle some of our facilities in 2010 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 524 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve such temporary idling could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the idling period the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary idlings nevertheless there is a risk of longterm asset impairment at sites that are temporarily idled if the economic downturn does not improve in the near term 

the credit environment could impact the company’s ability to borrow money in the future additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing in 2010 we repaid with cash 2176 million of our floating rate senior notes we plan to renegotiate our shortterm and accounts credit facility with our banks we expect to close on a new multiyear credit facility by the end of the first quarter of 2011 we expect the new credit facility will have the same financial covenants as our existing credit facility and will provide us the ability to refinance our 242 million of notes that become due and payable in april 2011 while we anticipate this new credit facility will be in place by the end of the first quarter 2011 there is no guarantee we will be able to negotiate and put into place the credit facility as described there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us while management believes our credit ratings will remain at an investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the economic downturn has caused a significant decline in steel manufacturing while steelmaking increased in 2010 it is still far below levels of the past we anticipate this weakness to continue in 2011 the specialty products business also requires significant 

amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages 

our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods

aggregates business 

as of december 31 2010 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 269 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 27 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 99 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 59 are on land owned in part and leased in part 107 are on leased land and 4 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years based on normalized levels of production and 107 years at current production rates 

however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2010 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 15 properties in 3 states of which 11 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 4 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — other financial information — critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2010 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its four reportable business segments 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used during 2010 the principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 50 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however due to the current economic recession the company has adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2010 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 524 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idlings could continue the company expects however as the economy recovers it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend 

from time to time claims of various types are asserted against the company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business including claims relating to land use and permits safety health and environmental matters such as noise abatement blasting vibrations air emissions and water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of 

management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its operating segments

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend 

as of december 31 2010 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the 

company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2010 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2010 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2010 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2010 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2010 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2010 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2010 annual report

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure commercial agricultural and residential the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry in 2009 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 90 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 10 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the 

acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence in georgia and tennessee particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

in 2009 the company acquired three quarry locations plus the remaining 49 interest in an existing joint venture from cemex inc the quarry operations are located in nebraska wyoming and utah while the 49 interest purchased relates to a quarry in wyoming where the company was the operating manager the acquired locations enhanced the company’s existing longhaul distribution network and provided attractive product synergies 

between 2001 and 2009 the company disposed of or permanently shut down a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its specialty products segment in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2010 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group collectively the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2009 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2009 consolidated financial statements the “2009 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2009 annual report to shareholders the “2009 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries as well as agriculture railroad ballast chemical and other uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2009 the company’s aggregates business shipped 1234 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 14 billion and 1770 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 55 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the historic economic recession has resulted in unprecedented declines in aggregates shipments as evidenced by united states aggregates consumption declining by almost 40 from the peak volume in 2006 further states have stalled construction spending due to budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues and uncertainty related to longterm federal highway funding 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” the federal economic stimulus plan signed into law in february 2009 provided approximately 30 billion of additional funding for highways bridges and airports expected to be spent through 2012 the company also anticipates that other components of arra including for example federal spending for rail transportation public transit and the army corps of engineers should result in increased construction activity there have been delays in stimulusrelated jobs reaching the actual construction phase as evidenced by only 21 of total arra highway funds being spent at the state level in 2009 the company expects the majority of stimulus project work to occur in 2010 with any carryover in 2011 and 2012 the year all spending by law should be completed 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 289 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina georgia iowa and louisiana account for approximately 56 of total 2009 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time the current economic recession nationally and in these states has negatively impacted the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall or severe drought however can jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2009 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 69 by truck 20 by rail and 11 by water the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in recent years the company has brought additional capacity on line at its bahamas and nova scotia locations to transport materials via oceangoing ships during the recent economic recession the company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe environmentallysound operations as the company returns to a more normalized operating environment management expects to focus a significant part of its capital growth spending program on expanding key southeast and southwest operations 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

the water and rail distribution network initially resulted in the company increasing its market share in certain areas however recent consolidation in the aggregates industry has made it more competitive for the company in various parts of the country the company believes that as shipment volumes recover the company will increase its market share in those areas 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew 

availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

the company’s longterm shipping contracts are generally takeorpay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements if the company fails to ship the minimum tonnages in a given year under the agreement it will be required to pay the shipping company the contractuallystated minimum amount for that year in 2009 the company incurred a 20 million expense due to not shipping the minimum tonnages similar charges are possible in 2010 if shipment volumes do not increase 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been consolidating and the company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry when acquired new locations sometimes do not satisfy the company’s internal safety maintenance and pit development standards and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized management expects a slowing in the industry consolidation trend as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in highgrowth markets declines during the recent period of fewer acquisition opportunities the company has focused on investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the 

company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 8 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2009 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company the results of these operations are currently insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 198 million 248 million and 223 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2009 69 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 30 to lime and 1 to stone net sales of chemical products in 2009 were enhanced by the acquisition of the elastomag Ò product line from morton international inc in 2008 overall net sales in the specialty products business decreased in 2009 reflecting slowing magnesia chemicals sales and reduced dolomitic lime shipments to the steel industry both trends consistent with declines in general industrial demand 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2009 approximately 70 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 30 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 40 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2009 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace these trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors the economic downturn has caused a significant decline in the manufacturing of steel the company anticipates continued weakness in the manufacturing of steel for much of 2010 dependent upon domestic economic recovery rates 

management has shifted the strategic focus of this magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 10 of the revenues of the specialty products business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 162 million 243 million and 202 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 

respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 12 2010 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 114 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 115 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 4000 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 31 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels river barges and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 10 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2009 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2009 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products the company spent approximately 04 million in 2009 06 million in 2008 and 09 million in 2007 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 87 million in 2009 and approximately 115 million in 2008 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 55 million in 2009 and are expected to be approximately 55 million in 2010 and 2011 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2009 and 2008 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation 

methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries for additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2009 financial statements and the 2009 annual report the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2009 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2009 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 

10k and the 2009 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in the vicinity of and beneath the specialty products facility in manistee michigan there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company’s whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of 

mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

the company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions on december 7 2009 the usepa made an endangerment finding under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the six greenhouses gases are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride beginning in 2010 facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more per year of greenhouse gases will be required to annually report greenhouse gas generation to comply with the usepa’s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule the usepa has also proposed a rule to impose additional permitting requirements on existing greenhouse gas sources emitting greater than 25000 metric tons per year of greenhouse gases in congress both the house and senate are considering climate change legislation including the “capandtrade” approach cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap various states where the company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives and the company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed 

the operations of the company’s aggregates business are not major sources of greenhouse gas emissions most of the greenhouse gas emissions from aggregate operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earthmoving equipment the lime manufacturing operation of the company’s specialty products business in woodville ohio releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide during the production of lime and will be filing an annual report of its greenhouse gas emissions the company believes it is likely that a tax will be enacted or operational restraints or additional permitting requirements will be implemented on emissions of greenhouse gases from its woodville operation however the company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to greenhouse gas emission limitations at the woodville operation would be passed on to its customers the specialty products operation in manistee michigan releases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products and will be filing an annual report of its greenhouse gas emissions the company believes that the manistee facility will be subject to additional permitting requirements if pending federal legislation or regulations are passed the magnesium oxide products compete against other products which emit a lower level of greenhouse gases in their production therefore the manistee facility may have to absorb extra costs due to the pending greenhouse gas regulations in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market the company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs might be the fastest growing part of the business is magnesium hydroxide however and the company believes its market competition will be similarly regulated under the greenhouse gas 

legislation and regulations the manistee facility sells materials to distributors and customers in a number of countries in asia europe and south america and to canada and mexico the company is analyzing the obligations of our global customer base with regards to climate change treaties and accords 

employees 

as of january 31 2010 the company has approximately 4554 employees of which 3351 are hourly employees and 1203 are salaried employees included among these employees are 636 hourly employees represented by labor unions 140 of the company’s employees of such amount 131 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while 100 of the specialty products segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the specialty products business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2011 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2010 while the company’s management does not expect significant difficulties in renewing these labor contracts there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at the woodville location this year or at the manistee location next year

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “will” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could continue to fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and the aggregates intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products the recent economic recession is an example and our business has been hurt construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of texas north carolina georgia iowa and louisiana our profitability will decrease we are experiencing this situation with the current economic recession 

the historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry use of aggregate products in the united states has declined almost 40 from the highest volume in 2006 the states have also reduced their construction spending because of budget shortfalls caused by lower tax revenues and uncertainly relating to longterm federal highway funding there has been a reduction in many states’ investment in highway maintenance these factors resulted in a continued reduction in sales of aggregate products for the company during 2009 which combined with a widespread decline in aggregates pricing hurt the company’s business 

in february 2009 president obama signed into law an economic stimulus plan which was designed to stimulate the economy by providing over 29 billion in new funding for transportation infrastructure however nationally only about 21 of stimulus spending occurred in 2009 the majority of stimulus spending is expected to occur in 2010 with expected carryover in 2011 and 2012 the last year of the stimulus plan spending while management believes the federal stimulus plan will increase the company’s aggregates shipments in 2010 and 2011 we cannot be assured of the full impact of the stimulus plan 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregate products for use in both commercial construction and residential construction commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions historical merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting lack of credit availability the commercial construction market remained weak in 2009 notably in office and retail construction management expects the commercial construction market to decline in 2010 approximately 25 of our aggregates shipments in 2009 were to the commercial construction market also continued weakness in the residential construction market negatively affected the commercial construction market the residential construction market remained dismal in 2009 in connection with the housing market downtown while management believes the residential construction market has bottomed out and 

expects moderate growth in 2010 we cannot be assured of such growth approximately 7 of our aggregates shipments in 2009 were to the residential construction market 

our aggregate products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these projects the current federal highway law passed in 2005 provided funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs but ended september 30 2009 while a multiyear successor federal highway bill has not been approved congress has extended the provisions of the current law under continuing resolutions through february 28 2010 we cannot be assured that congress will pass a multiyear successor federal highway bill or will continue to extend the provisions of the current law at the same level authorized in the current federal highway law similarly each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business nearly all states are now experiencing statelevel funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects north carolina and texas are among the states experiencing these pressures and these states disproportionately affect our revenues and profits 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material particularly by barge adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies restrict production and limit movement of barge traffic the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to 

transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower 

margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy such as fixedprice supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results moreover fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult for example in 2008 increases in energy costs lowered net earnings for our businesses by 065 per diluted share when compared with 2007 prices conversely in 2009 decreases in energy costs contributed 101 to our net earnings per diluted share we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price reductions fuel efficiency consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices 

in addition the price of liquid asphalt is a large part of the cost of producing hot mix asphalt products and can cause road builders and commercial contractors to delay or defer work in anticipation of liquid asphalt cost changes in 2008 liquid asphalt prices more than doubled over the prior year price with prices in excess of 800 per ton at their peak 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations we are currently involved in various legal proceedings in both federal and state courts relating to our greenwood missouri operations a jury verdict for actual and exemplary damages was rendered against us in favor of the city of greenwood in one of the state court proceedings based on the jury’s finding that quarry customers’ trucks caused damage to a road in greenwood the missouri supreme court recently declined to accept our appeal in this proceeding the company’s management believes this result in state court is unsupported by relevant legal principles and is considering our alternatives although we cannot reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding accordingly we have recorded an 119 million legal reserve on our books as of december 31 2009 while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 131 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 974 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2010 and august 2011 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2005 and partially in 2006 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeastern region of the united states in 2005 and 2006 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge in 2007 dry weather caused low water levels and resulted in reduced tonnage that could be shipped on a barge consequently the per ton cost of transporting material was higher than normal in 2008 high water levels from severe flooding in iowa hurt both shipments and operations 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products in 2007 barges were particularly scarce as barges were being retired faster than new barges were being built in 2005 we leased 780 additional rail cars in 2006 we contracted to buy 50 new barges that were delivered in 2007 in 2008 we leased additional rail cars in the southwest 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes how we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we were required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this resulted in a reduction of our earnings and made comparisons between financial periods more difficult beginning in 2009 we were required under new accounting standards to determine whether instruments granted in stockbased payment transactions under our employee benefit plans were considered “participating securities” and included in determining our earnings per share this resulted in a reduction of our previouslyreported net earnings and decreased our previouslyreported earnings per share amounts we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2009 financial statements 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations to capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending without continued economic stimulus at the federal level 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or endusers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and although the amount of our bad debt writeoffs has increased we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during this economic downturn we have been forced to shut down some of our facilities permanently and have temporarily idled others in 2009 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 488 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve such temporary idling could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the idling period the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary idlings nevertheless there is a risk of longterm asset impairment at sites that are temporarily idled if the economic downturn does not improve in the near term 

the current credit environment has limited our ability to issue borrowings under our commercial paper program additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing in 2009 we issued 38 million shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of 293 million we also entered into a 100 million threeyear secured accounts receivable credit facility and a 130 million unsecured term loan we further amended our various credit agreements to provide for an increased leverage ratio covenant there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us our senior unsecured long term debt is rated bbb by standard  poor’s and baa3 by moody’s our commercial paper is rated a2 by standard  poor’s and p3 by moody’s while management believes our credit ratings will remain at an investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the economic downturn has caused a significant decline in steel manufacturing we anticipate this weakness to continue in 2010 the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by high fuel prices or shortages 

our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not 

approved by the board of directors additionally the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods 

              

investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the company and may be material to the company the company has listed all known material risks it considers relevant in evaluating the company and its operations the forwardlooking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections 27a and 21e these forwardlooking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current expectations and the company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

aggregates business 

as of december 31 2009 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 274 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 27 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 101 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 59 are on land owned in part and leased in part 110 are on leased land and 4 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production and 109 years at current production rates however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2009 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 15 properties in 3 states of which 11 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 4 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — other financial information — critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 

7 of this form 10k and the 2009 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful 

  

 

 

specialty products business 

the specialty products business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

the company leases a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which previously served as the assembly and manufacturing hub for the former structural composites product line of the specialty products business this lease will expire on march 31 2010 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its four reportable business segments 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used during 2009 the principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 60 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however due to the current economic recession the company has adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and temporarily idled some of its facilities in 2009 the company’s aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity which restricted the company’s ability to capitalize 488 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal operating conditions if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and temporary idlings could continue the company expects however as the economy recovers it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time claims of various types are asserted against the company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business including claims relating to land use and permits safety health and environmental matters such as noise abatement blasting vibrations air emissions and water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its operating segments 

the company was not required to pay any penalties in 2009 for failure to disclose certain “reportable transactions” under section 6707a of the internal revenue code

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend 

as of december 31 2009 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2009 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2009 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the foregoing evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in exchange act rule 13a15e which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and 

exchange commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2009 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2009 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2009 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2009 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2009 annual report

 item 1 business 

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure commercial agricultural and residential the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and structural composite products in 2008 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 91 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 9 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the parties contributed a total of 15 active quarry operations to the joint venture 

in 2008 the company entered into a swap transaction with vulcan materials company “vulcan” pursuant to which it acquired six quarry locations in georgia and tennessee the newly 

acquired locations significantly expanded the company’s presence in georgia and tennessee particularly south and west of atlanta georgia the company also acquired a land parcel previously leased from vulcan at the company’s three rivers quarry near paducah kentucky in addition to a cash payment as part of this swap the company divested to vulcan its only california quarry located in oroville an idle facility north of san antonio texas and land in henderson north carolina formerly leased to vulcan 

between 2001 and 2008 the company disposed of or permanently shut down a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2009 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group collectively the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses and the structural composites product line information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2008 consolidated financial statements the “2008 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2008 annual report to shareholders the “2008 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries as well as miscellaneous uses such as agriculture railroad ballast and chemical uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2008 the company’s aggregates business shipped 1594 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 29 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 17 billion and 3310 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 50 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the 

construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “the act” or “the economic stimulus plan” was signed into law on february 17 2009 for the purpose of creating jobs and restoring economic growth through among other things the modernization of the united states’ infrastructure the enhancement of america’s energy independence and the expansion of educational opportunities as the act could create significant construction spending demand for our products could be affected by the economic growth anticipated under the act we estimate that for every 1 million that is spent directly on highways roads and bridges approximately 10000 tons of construction aggregates are required the act allocates 275 billion for highways and bridges we also expect that other spending components of the act could lead to a change in construction activity including spending allocated to the following areas 11 billion for airports 84 billion for mass transit 80 billion for high speed rail 46 billion for the army corps of engineers 60 billion for water and sewer projects 42 billion for united states department of defense facilities 64 billion to clean nuclear weapon sites 60 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy 20 billion for renewable energy tax incentives 63 billion to states for energy efficiency and clean energy grants 445 billion for schools and 66 billion for a first time homebuyer credit of 8000 the spending under the act will take at least several months before congress could appropriate such funds and each state could take appropriate measures to take advantage of such funding in addition each state would have to approve various infrastructure projects to be funded through the act we cannot be assured as to the nature extent or timing of the full impact of the spending under the act and our estimate of 10000 tons per 1 million constitutes an estimate that will not necessarily result in actual tonnage 

the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 288 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants to customers in 29 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states north carolina texas georgia iowa and florida account for approximately 60 of total 2008 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time the current economic recession nationally and in these states has negatively impacted the company’s aggregates business 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall or severe drought however can jeopardize shipments production and profitability in all of the company’s markets due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years during 2008 the company was negatively impacted in the southwest and southeast by hurricanes gustav hannah and ike and also by tropical storm fay further iowa experienced severe flooding during 2008 which negatively affected both shipments and operations 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2008 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 70 by truck 19 by rail and 11 by water the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts the company has previously brought additional capacity on line at its bahamas and nova scotia locations to transport materials via oceangoing ship in 2006 the company completed a highlyautomated plant and barge loadout 

system at its three rivers facility in kentucky a key site in the company’s longhaul distribution network which plant is capable of producing more than 8 million tons per year for shipment to 14 states along the ohio and mississippi river network 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

the company is currently focusing a significant part of its capital spending program on locations that are part of the rail transportation network along the geological fall line in 2008 the company completed its new plant in augusta georgia which increased capacity from 2 million tons per year to 6 million tons per year and will help serve highgrowth markets in georgia and florida however during the current recession the company has scaled back its capital program and has delayed significant projects pending recovery in the economy 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

from time to time the company has experienced rail transportation shortages particularly in the southwest and southeast these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching in 2006 the company brought a new plant online on a greensite at its north troy operation in oklahoma which is capable of producing 5 million tons per year and handling multiple 90car unit trains certain of the company’s sales yards in the southwestern region of the united states have the system capabilities to meet the unit 

train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in this region in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings further in 2005 the company addressed certain of its railcar needs for future shipments by leasing 780 railcars under two master lease agreements in 2008 the company entered into lease agreements for additional railcars for its southwest division 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been in a consolidating mode the company’s management expects this trend to continue but at a slower rate as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in high growth markets decline however acquisition opportunities may increase in the short term as large multinational competitors may be forced to sell assets acquired in recent transactions to generate cash to fund debt obligations the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses investing in internal expansion projects in highgrowth markets and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 5 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2008 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company the results of these operations are currently insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 

years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 248 million 223 million and 250 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2008 69 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 28 to lime and 2 to stone with the remaining 1 attributable to the structural composite products line described below sales of chemical products in 2008 were enhanced by the acquisition of the elastomag Ò product line from morton international inc 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2008 approximately 75 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 25 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 40 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2008 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products in 2008 the severe economic decline in the second half of the year caused a significant downturn in the manufacturing of steel accordingly the sales and earnings of the specialty products business were negatively affected during the fourth quarter of 2008 and management anticipates the continued weakness in the manufacturing of steel for much of 2009 

management has shifted the strategic focus of this magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 13 of the revenues of the specialty products business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 243 million 202 million and 170 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

the company also develops structural composite products through its specialty products business and its whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta composites “mmc” pursuant to various agreements mmc has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies including those related to flat panel applications these agreements give mmc the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technologies for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors mmc continued its commercialization during 2008 of these structural composites technologies and initiated other selected products in related target markets however during 2008 the company wrote off 17 million of machinery and equipment used for the structural composite products line as the assets had no future use to the company there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 10 2009 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 115 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 80 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 4000 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 31 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels river barges and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 13 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2008 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composites product line at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2008 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 06 million in 2008 09 million in 2007 and 07 million in 2006 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 115 million in 2008 and approximately 91 million in 2007 and are related to the company’s environmental staff ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and asset retirement costs capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 58 million in 2008 and are expected to be approximately 84 million in 2009 and 84 million in 2010 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2008 and 2007 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the 

courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

with respect to reclamation costs effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2008 financial statements and the 2008 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2008 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2008 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2008 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in the vicinity of and beneath the specialty products facility in manistee michigan there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company’s whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the 

liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business 

employees 

as of january 31 2009 the company has approximately 4860 employees of which 3600 are hourly employees and 1260 are salaried employees included among these employees are 670 hourly employees represented by labor unions 138 of the company’s employees of such amount 127 of the company’s aggregates business’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while 903 of the specialty products segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the specialty products business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2011 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2010

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “will” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

the current market environment has hurt the economy and we have considered the impact on our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could continue to fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending 

the lack of available credit has limited the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects several of our top sales states have stopped bidding projects in their transportation departments 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products such as is occurring with the current economic recession construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of north carolina texas georgia iowa and florida our profitability will decrease we are experiencing this situation with the current economic recession 

moreover infrastructure spending in 2008 was hurt by the overall weakness in the economy which leads to lower tax revenues and state government budget deficits further rising construction and material prices are both constraining highway budgets additionally lack of access to the capital markets has precluded many state and local governments from issuing bonds that would provide financing for construction projects 

in february 2009 president obama signed into law an economic stimulus plan which will provide billions of dollars in new funding for transportation infrastructure however there will be a time delay of at least several months before congress can appropriate such funds and each state can take appropriate measures to take advantage of such funding in addition each state will have to approve various infrastructure projects to be funded through the new federal stimulus plan so while management believes the federal stimulus plan will increase the company’s aggregates shipments in the latter half of 2009 and in 2010 we cannot be assured of the full impact of the stimulus plan 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregate products for use in both commercial construction and residential construction commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions historical merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting lack of credit availability the commercial construction market declined in 2008 notably from credit availability and felt most significantly starting in september 2008 also continued weakness in the residential construction market negatively affected the commercial construction market the residential construction market remained dismal in 2008 in connection with the housing market downtown further the outlook reflects 

diminished demand which is further exacerbated by the overall weakness in the economy and the financial institutions crisis approximately 9 of our aggregates shipments in 2008 were to the residential construction market 

our aggregate products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these projects for example while the current federal highway law passed in 2005 provides funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs through september 30 2009 congress must pass an appropriations bill each year to approve spending these funds we cannot be assured that congress will pass an appropriations bill each year to approve funding at the level authorized in the federal highway law similarly each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business for example we expect delays in infrastructure spending in georgia north carolina south carolina and texas will continue in 2009 which will limit our business growth in those states until the level and timing of spending improves 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material particularly by barge adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies restrict production and limit movement of barge traffic the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical but we can give no assurances that we will be successful 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe that our cash on hand along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business we may be required among other things to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products as another example our aggregates business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire acquisition opportunities may increase in the short term as large multinational competitors may be forced to sell assets acquired in recent transactions to generate cash to fund debt obligations in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we have acquired many companies since 1995 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results for example in 2008 increases in prices of petroleumbased products lowered net earnings for our businesses by 065 per diluted share when compared with 2007 prices we do not hedge our diesel fuel price risk but instead focus on volumerelated price breaks fuel efficiency and consumption 

in addition the price of liquid asphalt is a large part of the cost of producing hot mix asphalt products and can cause road builders and commercial contractors to delay or defer work in anticipation of liquid asphalt cost changes in 2008 liquid asphalt prices more than doubled over the prior year price with prices in excess of 800 per ton at their peak 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 127 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 903 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2010 and august 2011 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2005 and partially in 2006 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeastern region of the united states in 2005 and 2006 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge in 2007 dry weather caused low water levels and resulted in reduced tonnage that could be shipped on a barge consequently the per ton cost of transporting material was higher than normal in 2008 high water levels from severe flooding in iowa hurt both shipments and operations 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products in 2007 barges were particularly scarce as barges were being retired faster than new barges were being built in 2005 we leased 780 additional rail cars in 2006 we contracted to buy 50 new barges that were delivered in 2007 in 2008 we leased additional rail cars in the southwest 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we were required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this resulted in a reduction of our earnings and made comparisons between financial periods more difficult we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2008 financial statements 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations to capital projects state and federal budget issues may continue to negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending without economic stimulus at the federal level 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers we are protected in part however by payment bonds posted by many of our customers nevertheless we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn historically our bad debt writeoffs have not been significant to our operating results and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 

during this economic downturn we have been forced to shut down some of our facilities on a temporary basis if demand does not improve such shutdowns could become longerterm impairing the value of some of the assets at those locations the timing of increased demand will determine when these locations will be reopened during the shutdown time the plant and equipment will continue to be depreciated if practicable we will transfer the mobile equipment and use it elsewhere because we continue to have longterm access to the aggregate reserves these sites are not considered impaired during temporary shutdowns 

the current credit environment has limited our ability to issue borrowings under our commercial paper program additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms interest rates on new issuances of longterm public debt in the market have recently increased reflecting higher credit and risk premiums further an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing andor increase our cost of obtaining financing in 2008 we issued 300 million of our senior notes and refinanced our 200 million notes due december 2008 there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program to the extent it is available to us in 2008 moody’s downgraded our longterm debt rating to baa3 from baa1 and downgraded our commercial paper rating to p3 from p2 with a stable outlook in 2008 standard  poor’s reaffirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of bbb and downgraded the outlook to negative but left our commercial paper rating of a2 unchanged while management believes our credit ratings will remain at an investmentgrade level we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes the company will continue to have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs there can be no assurance of that 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the steel industry experienced a severe downturn in the second half of 2008 which is expected to continue in 2009 the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by high fuel prices or shortages 

our structural composites product line has not generated any profits since its inception 

our structural composites product line faces many challenges before it becomes breakeven or generates a profit we cannot ensure the future profitability of this product line 

our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the board of directors 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods

aggregates business 

as of december 31 2008 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 273 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 26 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 101 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 58 are on land owned in part and leased in part 110 are on leased land and 4 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on normalized levels of production however certain locations may be 

subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2008 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 15 properties in 3 states of which 11 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 4 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information — critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2008 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful 

 

 

specialty products business 

the specialty products business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio both of these facilities are owned 

the company leases a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for the structural composites product line of martin marietta composites 

other properties 

the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices for its four reportable business segments 

the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used during 2008 the principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 80 and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand however due to the current economic recession the company has adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products for example the company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities closed some of its facilities and shut down some of its facilities on a temporary basis if demand does not improve over the near term such reductions and shutdowns could continue the company expects however as the economy recovers it will be able to resume production at its normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time claims of various types are asserted against the company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business including claims relating to land use and permits safety health and environmental matters such as noise abatement blasting vibrations air emissions and water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its operating segments

that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2008 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2008 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2008 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2008 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2008 annual report 

included among the exhibits to this form 10k are forms of “certifications” of the company’s ceo and cfo as required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certification” the section 302 certifications refer to this evaluation of the company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

tableend 

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure commercial agricultural and residential the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and structural composite products in 2007 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 92 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 8 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the joint venture was formed by the parties contributing a total of 15 active quarry operations with production of approximately 75 million tons annually 

between 2001 and 2007 the company disposed of or permanently shut down a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2008 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group collectively the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesiabased chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses and the structural composites product line information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” of the company’s 2007 consolidated financial statements the “2007 financial statements” which are included under item 8 of this form 10k and are part of the company’s 2007 annual report to shareholders the “2007 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries as well as miscellaneous uses such as agriculture railroad ballast and chemical uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of other construction materials businesses these businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is a leading producer of aggregates for the construction industry in the united states in 2007 the company’s aggregates business shipped 1823 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 18 billion and 4318 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 48 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 287 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants in 28 states canada and the bahamas the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states north 

carolina texas georgia iowa and south carolina account for approximately 61 of total 2007 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s aggregates business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years the company did not incur significant damage from hurricanes during 2007 however during 2007 the west group particularly texas southern oklahoma and kansas experienced near historic levels of rainfall and flooding which affected both shipments and operations 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2007 the originating mode of transportation for the company’s aggregates shipments was 74 by truck 17 by rail and 9 by water the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in recent years the company has brought additional capacity on line at its bahamas and nova scotia locations to transport materials via oceangoing ship further in 2006 the company completed the second largest capital project in its history a highlyautomated plant and barge loadout system at its three rivers facility in kentucky this new plant a key site in the company’s longhaul distribution network is capable of producing more than 8 million tons per year for shipment to 14 states along the ohio and mississippi river network the company is currently focusing a significant part of its capital spending program on locations along the geological fall line in georgia and south carolina which are part of the rail transportation network 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a 

number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

in 2005 and 2006 the company experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeast group these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during the economic downturn in the early part of this decade further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching in 2006 the company brought a new plant online on a greensite at its north troy operation in oklahoma which is capable of producing 5 million tons per year and handling multiple 90car unit trains certain of the company’s sales yards in the southwestern region of the united states have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements over the last few years the company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in this region in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings further in 2005 the company addressed certain of its railcar needs for future shipments by leasing 780 railcars under two master lease agreements 

the company experiences shortages of barges from time to time barge availability has become an issue as the rate of barges being retired is exceeding the rate at which new barges are being constructed shipyards that build barges are operating at capacity and the lead time for new barges is approximately 18 months to help alleviate this problem the company purchased 50 new barges in 2007 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company 

with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been in a consolidating mode the company’s management expects this trend to continue but at a slower rate as the number of suitable small to midsized acquisition targets in high growth markets decline the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 6 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2007 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company the results of these operations are currently insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 223 million 250 million and 164 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

specialty products business 

the company manufactures and markets through its specialty products business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2007 66 of specialty products’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 29 to lime and 2 to stone with the remaining 3 attributable to the structural composite products line described below 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2007 approximately 75 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 25 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry accordingly a portion of the profitability of the specialty products business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 70 of the specialty products’ net sales in 2007 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products during 2007 softness in housingrelated steel products and auto making curtailed demand for steel making further steel production in 2007 was reduced following a record year for steel imports in 2006 import rates in 2007 adjusted to the domestic market but the continued downturn in steelrelated industries will affect specialty products’ revenues 

management has shifted the strategic focus of this magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the specialty products business 

the principal raw materials used in the specialty products business are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the specialty products business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 specialty products entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from specialty products at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products specialty products also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the specialty products facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was 

completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from specialty products through the pipeline 

specialty products generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 12 of the revenues of the specialty products business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 202 million 170 million and 196 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the specialty products business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the specialty products business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

the company also develops structural composite products through its specialty products business and its whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta composites “mmc” pursuant to various agreements mmc has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies including those related to flat panel applications these agreements give mmc the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technologies for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors mmc continued its commercialization during 2007 of these structural composites technologies and initiated other selected products in related target markets 

in 2007 mmc narrowed the focus within several market sectors for its composite products military products including ballistic and blast panels transportation products including rail cars and other structural panel products mmc will continue to evaluate a variety of homeland security and commercial uses for composite materials there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 15 2008 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 129 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 59 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects 

relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

there are over 3800 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 31 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels river barges and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the company’s specialty products segment competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price technological advances and technical support for its products the specialty products business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 12 of revenues for the specialty products business in 2007 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the specialty products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesiabased chemicals business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composites product line at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2007 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 09 million in 2007 07 million in 2006 and 07 million in 2005 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 91 million in 2007 and approximately 85 million in 2006 and are related to the company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 41 million in 2007 and are expected to be approximately 3 million in each of 2008 and 2009 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2007 and 2006 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

with respect to reclamation costs effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2007 financial statements and the 2007 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” under item 3 of this form 10k “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” of the 2007 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2007 annual report and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” included under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2007 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated gdot testing laboratory that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 gdnr requested additional information which was duly submitted gdnr approved the plan on june 28 2005 and the company completed the installation of the remediation system the company funded the entire cost of the corrective plan and installation of the remediation system the groundwater monitoring and reporting which is the last task required by the consent order will occur over fifteen years management believes the future costs to be incurred by the company associated with the groundwater monitoring will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective 

action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 gdnr requested additional information in connection with its consideration of the submitted plan and subsequently approved the plan on july 19 2004 gdot filed an amendment to the plan which was approved on june 28 2005 gdot completed installation of the remediation system and has been proceeding with required groundwater monitoring and reporting activities which will occur over fifteen to twenty years under georgia law responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding any necessary remediation management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the future groundwater monitoring will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in the vicinity of and beneath the specialty products facility in manistee michigan there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company’s whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the specialty products business

 item 1a   risk factors and forwardlooking statements 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “will” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions the overall economy has been hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of north carolina texas georgia iowa and south carolina our profitability will decrease 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregate products for use in both commercial construction and residential construction commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall commercial construction was mixed in 2007 with growth slowing during the year in some areas we saw declining commercial construction activity including office and retail space as developers considered the impact of the current credit markets on construction and development plans businesses facing tighter credit conditions often find it difficult to obtain financing for capital investments the residential construction market declined sharply in 2007 in connection with the housing market downtown further the outlook reflects diminished demand with recovery not expected prior to late 2009 or 2010 approximately 12 of our aggregates shipments in 2007 were to the residential construction market 

our aggregate products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these projects for example while the current federal highway law passed in 2005 provides funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs through september 30 2009 congress must pass an appropriations bill each year to approve spending these funds we cannot be assured that congress will pass an appropriations bill each year to approve funding at the level authorized in the federal highway law similarly each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business for example we expect delays in infrastructure spending in florida north carolina south carolina and texas will continue in 2008 which will limit our business growth in those states until the level and timing of spending improves 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors seasonal changes and other weather conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity and the demand for our products adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve 

growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we must have access to large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe we have adequate cash to run our businesses because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed in nature our financial results are sensitive to production volume changes 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we acquired 62 companies from 1995 through 2002 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected at times by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results for example in 2007 increases in fuel prices lowered net earnings for the aggregates business by 010 per diluted share when compared with 2006 fuel prices 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 127 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 90 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2010 and august 2011 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2005 and partially in 2006 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeastern region of the united states in 2005 and 2006 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge in 2007 dry weather caused low water levels and resulted in reduced tonnage that could be shipped on a barge consequently the per ton cost of transporting material was higher than normal 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products barges have become particularly scarce since barges are being retired faster than new barges are being built shipyards that build barges are operating at capacity so the lead time to buy or lease a new barge can extend many months in 2005 we leased 780 additional rail cars in 2006 we contracted to buy 50 new barges that were delivered in 2007 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our stockbased compensation our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we were required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this resulted in a reduction of our earnings and made comparisons between financial periods more difficult we urge you to read about our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2007 financial statements 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business 

the current credit environment has negatively affected the economy and we have considered how it might affect our business demand for our products particularly in the commercial and residential construction markets could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations to capital projects we may also have difficulty placing our commercial paper in that it may take longer than we have recently experienced andor may cost more we experienced such problems in august and september 2007 but have not had placement problems since that time we expect we will refinance our 200 

million notes due december 2008 however there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

our specialty products business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our specialty products business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the specialty products business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by high fuel prices or shortages 

our structural composites product line has not generated any profits since its inception 

our structural composites product line faces many challenges before it becomes breakeven or generates a profit we cannot ensure the future profitability of this product line 

our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the board of directors 

              

investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the company and may be material to the company the forwardlooking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections 27a and 21e these forwardlooking

aggregates business 

as of december 31 2007 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 272 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 28 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 98 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 57 are on land owned in part and leased in part 113 are on leased land and 4 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2007 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 15 properties in 3 states of which 11 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 4 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the 

degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — other financial information — critical accounting policies and estimates property plant and equipment” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2007 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

tableend 

as of december 31 2007 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2007 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2007 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented 

by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2007 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2007 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2007 financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k and the 2007 annual report see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” under item 7 of this form 10k and the 2007 annual report 

included among the exhibits to this form 10k are forms of “certifications” of the company’s ceo and cfo as required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certification” the section 302 certifications refer to this evaluation of the company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

 item 1 business 

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure commercial agricultural and residential the company also has a specialty products segment that manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and structural composite products in 2006 the company’s aggregates business accounted for 92 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 8 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s aggregates operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas which provided the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions positioned the company for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwestern regions of the united states with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the joint venture was formed by the parties contributing a total of 15 active quarry operations with production of approximately 75 million tons annually 

between 2001 and 2006 the company sold a number of nonstrategic operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates business and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in some of its divestitures the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest nonstrategic assets during 2007 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in four reportable business segments the mideast group southeast group and west group comprising the aggregates business and the specialty products segment the specialty products segment includes the magnesia specialties business and the structural composites product line information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 3739 of the company’s 2006 annual report to shareholders the “2006 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates business 

the aggregates business mines processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries as well as miscellaneous uses such as agriculture railroad ballast and chemical uses the aggregates business also includes the operation of its other construction materials businesses these businesses located primarily in the west group were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company and include asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates in 2006 the company’s aggregates business shipped 1985 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 19 billion and 4003 million respectively 

the aggregates business markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 42 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 307 quarries underground mines distribution facilities and plants in 28 states canada and the bahamas the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states north carolina texas georgia iowa and south carolina account for approximately 58 of total 2006 net sales for the aggregates business by state of destination the company’s business is accordingly 

affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the operations of the aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern united states and canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states excessive rainfall can also jeopardize shipments production and profitability due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the operations of the aggregates business in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years during 2005 aggregates shipments in the company’s southeastern and gulf coast markets were adversely affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and several other storms during the 2005 recordsetting hurricane season 

natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the united states as a general rule truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to longhaul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates business 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck the rest by rail in contrast in 2006 the company’s aggregates shipments moved 73 by truck 16 by rail and 11 by water the majority of the rail and water movements occur in the southeast group and the west group the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts in recent years the company has brought additional capacity on line at its bahamas and nova scotia locations to transport materials via oceangoing ship further in 2006 the company completed the second largest capital project in its history a highlyautomated plant and barge loadout system at its three rivers facility in kentucky this new plant which is capable of producing more than 8 million tons per year for shipment to 14 states along the ohio and mississippi river network greatly expands the company’s longhaul distribution network 

in addition the company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail as discussed in more detail below the company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements these expansion projects have enhanced the company’s longhaul distribution network the company’s process improvement program has also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation mobile fleet modernization rightsizing and other cost control improvements accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the company’s 

expanded distribution system this distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via rail and water to markets where aggregates supply is limited 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southeast and west groups increase the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network primarily located within the southeast group also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company has entered into longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the company’s aggregates to various coastal ports 

in 2005 and to a lesser extent in 2006 the company experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeast group these shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during the economic downturn in the early part of this decade further in response to these issues rail transportation providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching in 2006 the company brought a new plant online on a greensite at its north troy operation in oklahoma which is capable of producing 5 million tons per year and handling multiple 90car unit trains certain of the company’s sales yards in the southwestern region of the united states have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements during 2005 and 2006 the company made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in this region in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings further in 2005 the company addressed certain of its railcar needs for future shipments by leasing 780 railcars under two master lease agreements 

in 2005 following hurricanes katrina and rita the company experienced delays and shortages relating to its transportation of barges along the mississippi river system as the gulf coast started to recover the company’s barge traffic improved however in 2006 the company experienced delays in shipping materials through lock 52 on the ohio river as scheduled repair and maintenance activities were performed these delays reduced the water traffic able to pass through lock 52 resulted in shipping delays for material shipped by barge through the lock during this time while the delays have ended and normal water traffic has resumed another twoweek planned outage is currently scheduled for august 2007 

during 2006 the company continued to experience shortages of barges from time to time barge availability has become an issue as the rate of barges being retired is exceeding the rate at which new barges are being constructed shipyards that build barges are operating at capacity and the lead time for new barges is approximately 18 months in 2007 the corporation will accept delivery of 50 new barges 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states 

the construction aggregates industry has been in a consolidating mode the company’s management expects this trend to continue but at a slower rate as the number of suitable acquisition targets in high growth markets decline the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the west group pursuant to which the company acquired asphalt ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 5 of revenues of the aggregates business in 2006 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company the results of these operations are currently insignificant to the company as a whole over the last few years the company has disposed of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully the acquired vertically integrated operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates business’ raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates business the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations 

the company generally sells products in its aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog the company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers 

less than 2 of the revenues from the aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 250 million 164 million and 154 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

specialty products business 

  magnesia specialties business  the company manufactures and markets through its magnesia specialties business magnesiabased chemical products for industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry these chemical products have varying uses including flame retardants wastewater treatment pulp and paper production and other environmental applications in 2006 65 of magnesia specialties’ net sales were attributable to chemical products 33 to lime and 2 to stone 

given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesiabased products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business 

in 2006 approximately 75 of the lime produced was sold to thirdparty customers while the remaining 25 was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry accordingly a portion of the profitability of the magnesia specialties business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace magnesia specialties’ products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 43 of the net sales of the business in 2006 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products however magnesia specialties’ management has shifted the strategic focus of its magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations accordingly that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business 

the principal raw materials used in magnesia specialties’ products are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a 

venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant order backlog inventory for magnesia specialties’ products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 12 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 170 million 196 million and 161 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively as a result of these foreign market sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

  structural composite products line  the company through its whollyowned subsidiary martin marietta composites “mmc” develops structural composite products pursuant to various agreements mmc has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies related to flat panel applications one of the agreements gives mmc the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technologies for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors such as bridge decks marine applications and other structures and applications mmc continued its research and product development activities during 2006 on these structural composites technologies and initiated or continued the manufacturing and marketing of selected products 

in 2006 mmc narrowed the focus within several market sectors for its composite products military transportation and infrastructure military products consist of ballistic and blast panels transportation products include commercial trucks and rail cars infrastructure products include bridge decks mmc is currently focusing its efforts on homeland security military applications and panel products to date mmc has completed 30 successful installations of bridge decks in 13 states and 2 foreign countries utilizing these composite materials technologies in 2006 mmc stopped using its license for the manufacture of composite truck trailers and wrote off its investment in this product application of its structural composites business mmc also downsized the management group and the hourly workforce associated with the structural composite product line in 2007 the remaining components of the structural composites product line have specific quarterly benchmarks to achieve to determine its viability mmc will continue to evaluate a variety of military and commercial uses for composite materials there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 16 2007 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 129 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 59 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its 

existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of any segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry competition in the aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the company’s production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the united states based on tons shipped there are over 3900 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 26 of the total market the company in its aggregates business competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels river barges and rail have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in the aggregates business some of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the magnesia specialties business of the company’s specialty products segment competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 12 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2006 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company 

the structural composites product line of the company’s specialty products segment competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of technological advances quality price and technical support the structural composites product line competes for sales to customers located outside the united states certain of the company’s competitors in the structural composites product line have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesia specialties business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composites product line at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2006 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 07 million in 2006 07 million in 2005 and 09 million in 2004 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately 85 million in 2006 and approximately 35 million in 2005 and are related to the company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately 64 million in 2006 and are expected to be approximately 2 million in each of 2007 and 2008 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2006 and 2005 however our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future despite our compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust 

control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

with respect to reclamation costs effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 36 and 37 of the 2006 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” 

on pages 27 and 28 of this form 10k and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 36 and 37 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” on pages 59 and 60 of the 2006 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry and mining facilities must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry mine and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also in certain markets the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral also known as quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases including silicosis and several scientific organizations and some states such as california have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust the company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures andor makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels the company through safety information sheets and other means also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

the clean air act amendments of 1990 required the us environmental protection agency the “epa” to develop regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants including lime manufacturing the new standards to be established would require plants in the targeted industries to install feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants thereby significantly reducing air emissions the company and other lime manufacturers through the national lime association “nla” the leading industry trade association worked with the epa to define test protocols better define the scope of the standards determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoringreporting requirements for the lime industry the epa received comments on its proposed technologybased standards for the industry in november 2000 and a proposed rule for the national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on december 20 2002 the proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues raised by nla in the negotiation process nla and the company submitted comments on the proposed rules in february 2003 the epa published the final rule in the federal register on january 5 2004 and facilities must be in compliance within three years after the date of publication the company successfully achieved 

compliance with the new technologybased standard by the january 5 2007 deadline the costs associated to comply with the new regulations did not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the company or of its magnesia specialties business 

in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated gdot testing laboratory that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 gdnr requested additional information which was duly submitted gdnr approved the plan on june 28 2005 and the company is implementing it the company is funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 gdnr requested additional information in connection with its consideration of the submitted plan and subsequently approved the plan on july 19 2004 gdot filed an amendment to the plan which was approved on june 28 2005 gdot has been proceeding with remediation activities which will occur over a number of years under georgia law responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding any necessary remediation management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in the vicinity of and beneath the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan facility there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations magnesia specialties 

believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to magnesia specialties pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business

 item 1a risk factors and forwardlooking statements 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “may” “wills” “could” “should” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify 

forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2006 annual report to shareholders 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of north carolina texas georgia iowa and south carolina our profitability will decrease 

within the construction industry we sell our aggregate products for use in both commercial construction and residential construction while the outlook for commercial construction is positive in many markets residential construction declined in 2006 and is expected to decline further in 2007 approximately 20 of our aggregates shipments in 2006 were to the residential construction market while we believe the downturn in residential construction will moderate during the latter part of 2007 we cannot be sure of the existence or timing of any moderation 

our aggregate products are used in public infrastructure projects which include the construction maintenance and improvement of highways bridges schools prisons and similar projects so our business is dependent on the level of federal state and local spending on these projects we cannot be assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these projects for example while the current federal highway law passed in 2005 provides funding of 2864 billion for highway transit and highway safety programs through september 30 2009 congress must pass an appropriations bill each year to approve spending these funds we cannot be assured that congress will pass an appropriations bill each year to approve funding at the level authorized in the federal highway law similarly each state funds its infrastructure spending from 

specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees along with voterapproved bond programs shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects even below amounts awarded under legislative bills delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business for example we expect delays in infrastructure spending in north carolina and south carolina will continue in 2007 which will limit our business growth in those states until the level and timing of spending improves 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

since the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors seasonal changes and other weather conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity and the demand for our products adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near either growing markets or longhaul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

the property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive therefore we must have access to large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe we have adequate cash to run our businesses because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed in nature our financial results are sensitive to production volume changes 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our 

magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock could fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we acquired 62 companies from 1995 through 2002 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston texas and our road paving businesses in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected at times by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 137 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 99 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2010 and august 2007 respectively while we do not expect any significant issues in renewing the manistee labor union agreement we cannot be sure a new agreement will be reached at the manistee location this year 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2005 and partially in 2006 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeastern region of the united states in 2005 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system in 2006 we experienced delays in shipping our materials through lock 52 on the ohio river while scheduled 

repair and maintenance activities were performed while the delays have ended and normal water traffic has resumed another twoweek planned outage is currently scheduled for august 2007 

water levels can also affect our ability to transport our products high water levels limit the number of barges we can transport and can require that we use additional horsepower to tow barges low water levels can reduce the amount of material we can transport in each barge 

the availability of rail cars and barges can also affect our ability to transport our products rail cars and barges can be used to transport many different types of products if owners sell or lease rail cars and barges for use in other industries we may not have enough rail cars and barges to transport our products barges have become particularly scarce since barges are being retired faster than new barges are being built shipyards that build barges are operating at capacity so the lead time to buy or lease a new barge can extend many months in 2005 we leased 780 additional rail cars in 2006 we contracted to buy 50 new barges that will be delivered in 2007 

we have longterm agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our bahamas and nova scotia operations to various coastal ports these contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2017 and generally contain renewal options our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our stockbased compensation our goodwill impairment testing our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate we could be wrong accordingly our financial results could be different either higher or lower we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2006 annual report to shareholders 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we were required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this resulted in a reduction of our earnings and made comparisons between financial periods more difficult we urge you to read about 

our accounting policies and changes in our accounting policies in note a of our 2006 financial statements 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by high fuel prices or shortages 

our structural composites product line has not generated any profits since its inception 

our structural composites product line faces many challenges before it becomes breakeven or generates a profit for 2007 we have set specific quarterly benchmarks for the structural composites product line to achieve in order for us to determine its viability we cannot ensure the future profitability of this product line 

market expectations for our financial performance are high 

we believe that the price of our stock reflects the recent advantageous shift in industry pricing trends whereby there is increased demand for aggregates along with scarcity of supply in highgrowth areas which has resulted in prices that are higher than historic levels if we are wrong about this change in pricing trends then other market dynamics such as lower volumes delays in infrastructure spending declines in residential construction and higher costs could result in lower pricing and lower earnings if this happens the market price of our stock could drop sharply the price of our stock may also reflect market expectations regarding further consolidation of the aggregates industry 

our articles of incorporation bylaws and shareholder rights plan and north carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws shareholder rights plan and north carolina law contain provisions that may delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction provisions that could delay deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following 

 

in addition we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the board of directors 

              

investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the company and may be material to the company the forwardlooking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections 27a and 21e these forwardlooking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current expectations and the company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

for a discussion identifying some important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements see the company’s securities and exchange commission filings including but not limited to the discussion under the heading “risk factors and forwardlooking statements” on pages 1724 of this form 10k the discussion of “competition” on page 11 of this annual report on form 10k “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 4081 of the 2006 annual report and “note a accounting policies” and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 1724 and pages 36 and 37 respectively of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2006 annual report

aggregates business 

as of december 31 2006 the company processed or shipped aggregates from 294 quarries underground mines and distribution yards in 28 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 103 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 59 are on land owned in part and leased in part 128 are on leased land and 4 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 

50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition as of december 31 2006 the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 13 properties in 3 states of which 11 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances and 2 are on leased land 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations the company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries setbacks and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other financial information — application of critical accounting policies — property plant and equipment” on pages 73 and 74 of the 2006 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

set forth in the tables below are the company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction shown on a statebystate basis and the company’s total annual production for the last 3 years along with the company’s estimate of years of production available shown on a segmentbysegment basis the number of producing quarries shown on the table include underground mines the company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a statebystate basis the changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year whether by acquisition disposition or otherwise production and sales in the normal course of business additional reserve estimates or refinements of the company’s existing reserve estimates opening of additional reserves at existing locations the depletion of reserves at existing locations and other factors the company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a companywide or segmentbysegment basis and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a statebystate basis from year to year are particularly meaningful 

 

 

specialty products business 

the magnesia specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in manistee michigan and woodville ohio and a smaller processing plant in bridgeport connecticut all of these facilities are owned

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time claims of various types are asserted against the company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business including claims relating to land use and permits safety health and environmental matters such as noise abatement blasting vibrations air emissions and water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of 

counsel it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its operating segments 

the company was not required to pay any penalties in 2006 for failure to disclose certain “reportable transactions” under section 6707a of the internal revenue code

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2006 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of december 31 2006 and further concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2006 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

the company’s management has issued its annual report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which included management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2006 the company’s independent registered 

public accounting firm has issued an attestation report agreeing with management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2006 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the related attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm appear on pages 10 and 11 of the 2006 annual report and those reports are hereby incorporated by reference in this form 10k see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” on page 62 of the 2006 annual report

 item 1 business 

general 

martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry including infrastructure commercial and residential the company also manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and is developing structural composite products for use in a wide variety of industries in 2005 the company’s aggregates segment accounted for 93 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 7 of the company’s total net sales 

the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a taxfree exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded 

initially the company’s operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of an aggregates business that included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including the acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network 

subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country and added a leading producer of aggregates products in texas providing the company with access to an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions set the stage for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio indiana and the southwest with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace 

in 1998 the company made an initial investment in an aggregates business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of this business which increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation 

effective january 1 2005 the company formed a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the joint venture was formed by the parties contributing a total of 15 active quarry operations with production of approximately 75 million tons annually 

between 2002 and 2005 the company sold a number of underperforming operations including aggregates asphalt ready mixed concrete trucking and road paving operations of its aggregates segment and the refractories business of its magnesia specialties business in 2005 the company divested underperforming facilities involved with its asphalt and road paving operations in arkansas and texas and shut down underperforming aggregates facilities in north carolina and ohio in some of its divestitures the company concurrently enters into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets during 2006 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

business segment information 

the company operates in two reportable business segments aggregates and specialty products the specialty products segment includes the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 33 and 34 of the company’s 2005 annual report to shareholders the “2005 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

aggregates 

the company’s aggregates segment processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries the aggregates segment also includes the operation of its other construction materials businesses these businesses acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company include primarily asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations 

the company is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates in 2005 the company’s aggregates segment shipped 2032 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands generating net sales and earnings from operations of 16 billion and 2992 million respectively 

the aggregates segment markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 45 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area with aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete sold and shipped from a network of approximately 325 quarries distribution facilities and plants in 28 states canada the bahamas and the caribbean islands although the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina georgia iowa and florida account for approximately 55 of total 2005 net sales by state of destination the company’s business is accordingly affected by the 

economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time 

the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets the aggregates segment’s operations that are concentrated in the northern region of the united states and canada experience more severe winter weather conditions than the segment’s operations in the southeast and southwest due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the segment’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years during 2005 aggregates shipments in the company’s southeastern and gulf coast markets were adversely affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and several other storms during the 2005 recordsetting hurricane season 

aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the united states and there are many producers nationwide however as a general rule shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself as a result proximity of quarry facilities to customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its reach through increased access to rail transportation 

a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck while the balance of 7 was moved by rail in contrast the company’s aggregates shipments were moved 74 by truck 16 by rail and 10 by water in 2005 the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts the gulf and atlantic coastal areas are being supplied in part from the bahamas location two large quarries on the ohio river system and a canadian quarry on the strait of canso in nova scotia in addition the company’s acquisitions have expanded its ability to ship by rail accordingly the company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as geographic areas which can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system in 2002 and 2004 the company completed major projects to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its bahamas and nova scotia locations respectively which provided the opportunity for the company to capture future potential market growth and reduce costs although there can be no assurance of such growth and cost reductions in 2005 the company began a major project to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its three rivers location which when completed in 2006 will allow the consolidation of the company’s two large quarries on the ohio river system 

as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays 

a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the customer typically does not pay the company a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southwest and southeast increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network also increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions 

the company experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeast in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2005 these shortages resulted from the downsizing in personnel and equipment made by certain railroads in response to these issues rail transportation providers have focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate larger unit train movements a unit train is a freight train moving great tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching certain of the company’s sales yards in the southwest have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirement during 2005 the company added property and capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in the southwest in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings the company also addressed certain of its railcar needs in 2005 by entering into a purchase agreement for the construction of 780 railcars which the company is in the process of converting into two master lease agreements 

in 2005 following hurricanes katrina and rita the company experienced delays and shortages relating to its transportation of barges along the mississippi river system as the gulf coast started to recover the company’s barge traffic improved by the end of 2005 the company’s barge distribution system substantially resumed normal operations although the company continues to experience shortages of barges from time to time 

the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via barges and deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southwest and southeast 

the company’s management believes the overall longterm trend for the construction aggregates industry continues to be one of consolidation although the consolidation trend has slowed as the number of suitable acquisition targets shrinks the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increasing market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 

the company became more vertically integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the southwest pursuant to which the company acquired asphaltic concrete ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which establish vertical integration that complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for approximately 6 of revenues in 2005 these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating 

efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses were acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company these operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to the company as a whole in 2005 the company continued disposing of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully these operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves 

management believes the aggregates segment’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates segment the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations 

the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased 

the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculation the company also deducts loss factors such as property boundaries and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — application of critical accounting policies — property plant and equipment” on pages 64 and 65 of the 2005 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company 

the company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory of aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

less than 1 of the aggregates segment’s revenues are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 164 million 154 million and 146 million during 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

specialty products 

the company’s specialty products segment consists of the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business 

  magnesia specialties business  the company manufactures and markets through magnesia specialties dolomitic lime and magnesiabased chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental uses given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of this business excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of dolomitic lime and magnesiabased products is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of dolomitic lime and certain magnesiabased products requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns yearoveryear increases in natural gas and other fuel prices directly affect operating results 

magnesia specialties’ dolomitic lime products are sold primarily to the steel industry accordingly the profitability of the magnesia specialties business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace magnesia specialties’ products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 48 of the revenues of the business in 2005 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products however magnesia specialties’ management has shifted the strategic focus of its magnesiabased business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations moreover in 2005 the chemicals group portion of the magnesia specialties business continued to diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants in wastewater treatment in pulp and paper production and in other environmental applications and that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business 

the principal raw materials used in magnesia specialties’ products are dolomitic limestone and alkalirich brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future 

after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine in the past the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a 

venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of such pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline 

magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory for the magnesia specialties products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 

approximately 17 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 196 million 161 million and 125 million 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively as a result of these foreign revenues the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of changes in currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions 

  structural composite products business  the company manufactures and markets through martin marietta composites “mmc” structural composite products for use in a wide variety of industries pursuant to various agreements mmc has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies related to the company’s business one of the agreements gives mmc the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technologies for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors such as bridge decks marine applications and other structures and applications mmc continued its research and product development activities during 2005 on these structural composites technologies and initiated or continued manufacturing and marketing of selected products 

mmc is targeting several industries and the military for its fiberreinforced polymer composite materials infrastructure which includes pedestrian and vehicular bridge decks transportation which includes specialty trucks railcar components and truck and trailer components construction which includes wall panels temporary structures and industrial mats and military which includes ballistic absorption panels including orders received for approximately 9 million mmc has completed 30 successful installations of bridge decks in 13 states and 2 foreign countries utilizing these composite materials technologies mmc has a licensing agreement with a third party relating to a proprietary composite sandwich technology which mmc expects will play an important role in the product line related to flat panel applications in connection with this agreement mmc is obligated to complete the purchase of an additional flat panel machine in 2006 

mmc intends to continue to ramp up its structural composite products business during 2006 product trials and commercialization continue to be the nearterm focus of mmc improved performance in 2006 is essential to continued investment in this business mmc will continue to evaluate a variety of military and commercial uses for composite materials there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 21 2006 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 92 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 60 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole 

customers 

no material part of the business of either segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof 

competition 

because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business competition in the aggregates segment tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the company’s individual production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors 

the company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the united states based on tons shipped there are over 3900 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 27 of the total market the company in its aggregates segment competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access to rail transportation have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in certain extended areas certain of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company 

the magnesia specialties business of the company’s specialty products segment competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 13 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2005 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company 

the structural composite products business of the company’s specialty products segment is a startup business that competes or will compete with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of technological advances quality price and technical support 

the structural composite products business competes or will compete for sales to customers located outside the united states certain of the company’s competitors in the structural composite products business have greater financial resources than the company 

research and development 

the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesia specialties business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composite products business at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2005 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 07 million in 2005 09 million in 2004 and 06 million in 2003 on research and development activities 

environmental and governmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation 

the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were 35 million in 2005 and 53 million in 2004 and are related to the company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were less than 3 million in 2005 and are expected to be at or below that amount in 2006 and 2007 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2005 and 2004 despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 

many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an 

attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 

the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs 

management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 

with respect to reclamation costs effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 32 and 33 of the 2005 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs 

the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a 

material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” on pages 26 and 27 of this form 10k and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 32 and 33 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” on pages 54 and 55 of the 2005 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in general quarry sites must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations 

as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a mineral commonly called quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung disease the carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the international agency for research on cancer and later by the us national toxicology program in 1987 the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals the national toxicology program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen” in october 1996 the international agency for research on cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humans” the mine safety and health administration msha and the occupational safety and health administration osha both listed the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of their priorities in the 2005 regulatory agenda osha identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its top five health priorities and developed a draft regulation in 2003 the issue remains in the prerule status and osha is preparing a detailed risk assessment and plans to complete an external peer review of a draft assessment by april 2006 msha lists the development of a respirable crystalline silica standard as a longterm action and is considering several options to reduce miners’ exposure to crystalline silica no deadlines for action have been established by the agency the company through safety information sheets and other means communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 

the clean air act amendments of 1990 required the epa to develop regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants including lime manufacturing the new standards to be established would require plants in the targeted industries to install feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants thereby significantly reducing air emissions the company and other lime manufacturers through the national lime association the leading industry trade association “nla” worked with the epa to define test protocols better define the 

scope of the standards determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoringreporting requirements for the lime industry the epa received comments on its proposed technologybased standards for the industry in november 2000 and a proposed rule for the national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on december 20 2002 the proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues raised by nla in the negotiation process nla and the company submitted comments on the proposed rules in february 2003 the epa published the final rule in the federal register on january 5 2004 and facilities must be in compliance within three years after the date of publication the company believes that there are several alternatives for achieving compliance with the new technologybased standard and that any costs associated with the upgrade andor replacement of equipment required to comply with the new regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business 

in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated gdot testing laboratory that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 gdnr requested additional information which was duly submitted gdnr approved the plan on june 28 2005 and the company is implementing it the company is funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 gdnr requested additional information in 

connection with its consideration of the submitted plan and subsequently approved the plan on july 19 2004 gdot filed an amendment to the plan which was approved on june 28 2005 gdot has been proceeding with remediation activities which will occur over a number of years under georgia law responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding any necessary remediation if the company is required to fund the cost of remediation the company will pursue its right of contribution from the responsible parties management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition 

in the vicinity of and beneath the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan facility there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations magnesia specialties believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to magnesia specialties pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business

 item 1a risk factors and forwardlooking statements 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade our securities 

this form 10k and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain statements which to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities law investors are cautioned that all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that the company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “intend” “outlook” “plan” “project” “scheduled” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forwardlooking statements any or all of the company’s forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and in other publications may turn out to be wrong 

statements and assumptions on future revenues income and cash flows performance economic trends the outcome of litigation regulatory compliance and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forwardlooking statements numerous factors including potentially the risk factors described in this section could affect our forwardlooking statements and actual performance 

factors that the company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those set out below in addition to the risk factors described below we urge you to read our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2005 annual report to shareholders 

our aggregates business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry 

we sell most of our aggregate products to the construction industry so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry since our business depends on construction spending which can be cyclical our profits are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions construction spending is affected by economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal state and local governments if economic conditions change a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our aggregate products construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts 

while our aggregate operations cover a wide geographic area our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price if economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas particularly in our top five revenuegenerating states of texas north carolina georgia iowa and florida our profitability will decrease 

our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather  

the construction aggregates business is conducted outdoors seasonal changes and other weather conditions affect our business adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms cold weather snow and heavy or sustained rainfall reduce construction activity and the demand for our products adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss needed plant and equipment repairs time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events the construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occur in the spring summer and fall because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity the aggregates business production and shipment levels vary by quarter the second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable 

our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate products and our ability to mine them economically 

our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits near growing markets as communities have grown they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining we try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods including rail and water that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical 

our aggregates business is a capitalintensive business 

it is expensive to acquire property and machinery and produce our products therefore we must have access to large amounts of cash to operate our businesses we believe we have adequate cash to run our businesses because the business is capital intensive a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in nature therefore our financial results are sensitive to product volume changes 

our businesses face many competitors 

our businesses have many competitors some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do some of our competitors also operate on a worldwide basis our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market we also face competition for some of our products from alternative products for example our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesiabased products 

our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry 

we expect to continue to grow in part by buying other businesses while the pace of acquisitions has slowed considerably over the last few years we will continue to look for strategic businesses to acquire in the past we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations 

expand our operations and enter new geographic markets we will continue to make selective acquisitions joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our company however the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations we cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations 

we may need to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock we may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations if we use our common stock in this way the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted and the price of our stock may fall we operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the longterm shareholder return 

we acquired 62 companies from 1995 through 2002 some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have performed as well or better than we expected while others have not we have sold underperforming and other nonstrategic assets particularly lower margin businesses like our asphalt plants in houston and our road paving business in shreveport louisiana and texarkana arkansas 

short supplies and high costs of fuel and energy affect our businesses 

our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel natural gas coal petroleum coke and other energy the financial results of these businesses have been affected at times by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy while we can contract for some fuels and energy significant increases in costs or fluctuations in supplies of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use the environment and other areas of the law and litigation relating to these matters affect our businesses our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

many federal state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning land use the environment health safety and other regulatory matters govern our operations we take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations despite our extensive compliance efforts risk of liabilities particularly environmental liabilities is inherent in the operation of our businesses as it is with our competitors we cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future 

we are also subject to future events including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities which may result in additional compliance and other costs we could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action like pollution control facilities which could be substantial 

our operations are subject to manufacturing operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations including the related storage and transportation of raw materials products hazardous substances and wastes we are exposed to 

hazards including storage tank leaks explosions discharges or releases of hazardous substances exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery 

these risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death or property damage and may result in civil or criminal penalties which could hurt our productivity or profitability for example from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations as well as operations we have acquired from others and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations while we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively affect us 

labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses 

labor unions represent 146 of the hourly employees of our aggregates business and 982 of the hourly employees of our specialty products business our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the woodville ohio lime plant and the manistee michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in june 2006 and august 2007 respectively 

disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations we believe we have good relations with all of our employees including our unionized employees 

delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations 

transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers whether by truck rail barge or ship any significant delays disruptions or the nonavailability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations for example in 2004 and partially in 2005 we experienced rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeast in 2005 following hurricanes katrina and rita we experienced significant barge transportation problems along the mississippi river system 

our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management our estimates and assumptions could be wrong 

the accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards we make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters like our treatment of goodwill our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans our estimated income taxes and how we account for our property plant and equipment and inventory these estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex 

judgments if we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates our financial results could differ 

while we believe our estimates and assumptions are correct we could be wrong and our financial results could be different either higher or lower if our estimates and assumptions are wrong we urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2005 annual report to shareholders 

the adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results 

the accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time new or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively for example beginning in 2006 we are required under new accounting standards to expense the fair value of stock options we award our management and key employees as part of their compensation this will result in a reduction in our earnings and will make comparisons between financial periods more difficult we urge you to read about our accounting changes in note a of our 2005 financial statements 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could affect our business 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key personnel and executive officers our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel which could negatively affect our business 

our magnesia specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels 

our magnesia specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry while we have reduced this risk over the last few years this business is still dependent in part on the strength of the highlycyclical steel industry the magnesia specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas coal and petroleum coke and financial results are negatively affected by high fuel prices or shortages 

our structural composite products business is a startup business that has not generated any profits since its inception 

our structural composite products business faces many challenges before it becomes breakeven or generates a profit while it received its first significant orders in 2005 we cannot ensure the future profitability of this business 

              

investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the company and 

may be material to the company the forwardlooking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections 27a and 21e these forwardlooking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current expectations and the company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2005 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report agreeing with management’s assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2005 management’s report on the company’s internal controls and the related attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm appear on pages 10 and 11 of the 2005 annual report and those reports are hereby incorporated by reference in this form 10k see also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — internal control and accounting and reporting risk” on pages 56 and 57 of the 2005 annual report

 item 1 business general martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry including highways infrastructure commercial and residential the company also manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and is developing structural composite products for use in a wide variety of industries in 2004 the company’s aggregates segment accounted for 93 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 7 of the company’s total net sales the company was formed in 1993 as a north carolina corporation to succeed to the operations of the materials group of the organization that is now lockheed martin corporation an initial public offering of a portion of the company’s common stock was completed in 1994 followed by a transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100 of the company’s common stock being publicly traded initially the company’s operations were predominantly in the southeast with additional operations in the midwest in 1995 the company started its geographic expansion with the purchase of a significant aggregates business which included an extensive waterborne distribution system along the east and gulf coasts and the mississippi river smaller acquisitions that year including acquisition of the company’s granite operations on the strait of canso in nova scotia complemented the company’s new coastal distribution network another significant acquisition in 1997 expanded the company’s aggregates business in the middle of the country while another significant acquisition in 1998 added the leading producer of aggregates products in texas and provided the company with an extensive rail network in texas these two transactions set the stage for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in ohio and indiana the southeast and the southwest with the company completing 29 smaller acquisitions between 1997 and 1999 which allowed the company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace in 1998 the company also made its initial investment as described below in a business that would later serve as the company’s platform for further expansion in the southwestern and western united states in october 1998 the company purchased an initial 14 interest in the business of meridian aggregates company “meridian” in april 2001 the company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of meridian under the purchase option terms of the original investment agreement the purchase consideration consisted of 238 million including the original october 1998 investment of 42 million the retirement of debt the forgiveness of related party obligations and estimated amounts for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs plus the assumption of normal balance sheet liabilities the “meridian acquisition” at the time of the meridian transaction meridian operated 25 aggregates production facilities and seven railserved distribution yards in 11 4 

states in the southwestern and western united states and sold aggregates to customers in 14 states including six states in which the company had not previously conducted any business the meridian acquisition added more than 16 billion tons of aggregates reserves expanded the company’s presence in the southwest and western states and increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation in december 2004 the company announced the formation of a joint venture with hunt midwest enterprises effective january 1 2005 to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities of both companies in kansas city and surrounding areas the joint venture was formed by the parties contributing a total of 15 active quarry operations with production of approximately 75 million tons annually in 2002 the company completed a number of sales of nonstrategic operations in its aggregates division including the sale of facilities in illinois iowa ohio oklahoma tennessee and virginia in 2003 the company continued these sales of nonstrategic operations including the sale of facilities in alabama louisiana missouri ohio texas and west virginia in 2004 the company divested nonstrategic aggregate facilities in alabama california tennessee and washington as well as certain facilities involved with its asphalt ready mixed concrete and road paving operations in louisiana texas and oklahoma in some of these transactions the company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of these businesses the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest nonstrategic assets during 2005 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities in may 2001 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” sold certain assets related to the refractories portion of its magnesia specialties business to a subsidiary of minerals technologies inc for 34 million the company retained certain current assets including accounts receivable and certain liabilities relating to the refractories business in an accompanying manufacturing agreement magnesia specialties agreed to supply the subsidiary of minerals technologies with certain refractories products at market rates principally from the manistee michigan plant of magnesia specialties for a period of time following the sale this agreement ended in 2002 the sale of magnesia specialties’ refractories business lessened the dependence of the magnesia specialties business on the steel industry in addition in 2003 the magnesia specialties business also disposed of two of its nonstrategic lines of business in 2003 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary martin marietta composites inc “martin marietta composites” opened for business a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for its structural composite products “structural composite products” business 5 

business segment information the company operates in two reportable business segments aggregates and specialty products the specialty products segment includes the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales earnings from operations assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 32 and 33 of the company’s 2004 annual report to shareholders the “2004 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference aggregates the company’s aggregates division processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries the aggregates division also includes the operation of its other construction materials businesses these businesses acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company include primarily asphalt ready mix concrete and road paving operations the company is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates in 2004 the company’s aggregates division shipped 1915 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 32 states canada and the bahamas generating net sales and earnings from operations of 14 billion and 220 million respectively the aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 46 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population shifts and to changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete are sold and shipped from a network of approximately 325 quarries distribution facilities and plants in 28 states canada and the bahamas although the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina georgia iowa and indiana account for approximately 57 of total net sales by state of destination the company’s business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets as the company has expanded its exposure to winter weatherrelated risks has increased the aggregates division’s operations that are concentrated in the northern region of the united states and canada experience more severe winter weather conditions than the division’s operations in the southeast and southwest due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting 6 

the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the division’s operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years which have had a significant adverse impact on the financial performance of the company during 2004 aggregates shipments in the company’s southeastern and gulf coast markets were adversely affected by four hurricanes the company’s bahamas facility took two direct hits from hurricanes with limited physical damage however power was not restored at the facility for five weeks after the storms resulting in no production and limited shipments during that time aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the united states and there are many producers nationwide however as a general rule shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself as a result proximity of quarry facilities to customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower in addition acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its reach through increased access to rail transportation a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck while the balance of 7 was moved by rail in contrast the company’s aggregates shipments were moved 79 by truck 11 by rail and 10 by water in 2004 the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas and canada as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts the gulf and atlantic coastal areas are being supplied in part from the bahamas location two large quarries on the ohio river system and a canadian quarry on the strait of canso in nova scotia in addition the company’s acquisitions have expanded its ability to ship by rail accordingly in addition to increasing the company’s geographic presence through acquisitions the company has also enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts as well as additional geographic areas which can be accessed economically by the company’s expanded distribution system in 2002 the company completed a major project to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its bahamas location which provides the opportunity for the company to capture future potential market growth and reduce costs although there can be no assurance of such growth and cost reductions as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the customer typically does not pay the company a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the company’s expansion of its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southwest and southeast increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts 7 

during 2004 the company experienced significant rail transportation shortages in texas and parts of the southeast these shortages resulted from the downsizing in personnel and equipment made by certain railroads management is reviewing alternatives to address these issues in response to these issues rail transportation providers have focused on increasing the volume of cars related to transportation contracts and are generally enticing customers through the freight rate structure to accommodate unit train unloadings certain of the company’s sales yards in the southwest have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirement the waterborne distribution network increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions in 2004 the company signed longterm agreements that provide additional dedicated shipping capacity from the company’s bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports the company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southwest and southeast the company’s management believes the overall longterm trend for the construction aggregates industry continues to be one of consolidation although the consolidation trend is slowing as the number of suitable acquisition targets shrinks the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increased market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new technological opportunities related to the company’s existing markets prior to 1998 the company had historically focused on the production of aggregates and had not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction materials businesses the company became significantly more vertically integrated with a significant acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the southwest pursuant to which the company acquired asphaltic concrete ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which establish vertical integration that complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for about 8 of revenues in 2004 if the company were to continue its expansion strategy westward where vertically integrated operations are the norm profit margins generally would be adversely affected generally these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses have been acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company these operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to the company as a whole in 2004 the company continued disposing of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully these operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest nonstrategic assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities 8 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves management believes the aggregates division’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates segment the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous proven reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculation the company also deducts loss factors such as property boundaries and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves for additional information on the company’s assessment of reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — application of critical accounting policies — property plant and equipment” on pages 5860 of the 2004 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company the company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory of aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 9 

less than 1 of the aggregates division’s revenues are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 154 million 146 million and 100 million during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively specialty products the company’s specialty products division consists of the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business   magnesia specialties business  the company in 2004 also manufactured and marketed through magnesia specialties dolomitic lime and magnesiabased chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental uses given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of this business excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations a significant portion of the costs related to the production of dolomitic lime and magnesiabased products is of a fixed or semifixed nature in addition the production of dolomitic lime and certain magnesiabased products requires the use of natural gas coal and petroleum coke to fuel kilns yearoveryear increases in natural gas and other fuel prices directly affect operating results magnesia specialties’ dolomitic lime products are sold primarily to the steel industry accordingly the profitability of the magnesia specialties business is dependent on the production of steel and the related marketplace magnesia specialties’ products used in the steel industry accounted for approximately 48 of the revenues of the business in 2004 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products however magnesia specialties’ management has shifted the strategic focus of its magnesiabased business to higher margin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations moreover in 2004 the chemicals group portion of the magnesia specialties business continued to diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants in wastewater treatment in pulp and paper production and in other environmental applications and that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business the principal raw materials used in magnesia specialties’ products are dolomitic limestone and brine management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future historically after the brine is used in the production process the magnesia specialties business must dispose of the processed brine typically the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of such pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline 10 

the supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide in 2004 magnesia specialties purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various sources located in china while magnesia specialties does not expect an interruption in the supply of magnesia from these sources various factors associated with economic and political uncertainty in china could result in future supply interruptions if such an interruption were to occur magnesia specialties believes it could obtain alternate supplies worldwide although there could be no assurance that magnesia specialties could do so at current prices alternatively magnesia specialties believes it could adjust its mix of products andor increase production at its manistee michigan plant magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory for the magnesia specialties products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers approximately 14 of the revenues of the magnesia specialties business are from foreign jurisdictions principally canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the revenues of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 161 million 125 million and 103 million during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively as a result of these foreign revenues the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of changes in currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions   structural composite products business  the company in 2004 also manufactured and marketed through martin marietta composites “mmc” structural composite products for use in a wide variety of industries pursuant to various agreements mmc has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies related to the company’s business one of the agreements gives mmc the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technologies for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors such as bridge decks marine applications and other structures and applications mmc continued its research and product development activities during 2004 on these structural composites technologies and initiated or continued manufacturing and marketing of selected products since 2002 mmc has leased a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for the structural composite products business of mmc mmc is targeting several industries and the military for its fiberreinforced polymer composite materials infrastructure which includes pedestrian and vehicular bridge decks transportation which includes specialty truck trailers and chassis railcar components and tractor and trailer components and construction which includes wall panels temporary structures and industrial mats in 2004 mmc announced the installation of bridge decks in 2 states bringing its total to 27 bridge deck installations in 13 states and 2 foreign countries utilizing these composite materials technologies mmc continued to explore opportunities to introduce its composite bridge installations to foreign markets mmc has rights under a licensing agreement executed in 2001 regarding the manufacturing 11 

and marketing of commercial specialty truck trailers in north america utilizing fiberreinforced composite materials in 2002 mmc signed a licensing agreement relating to a proprietary composite sandwich technology which mmc expects will play an important role in the product line related to flat panel applications the first composite trailer prototype manufactured by mmc was completed in 2003 and further developed in 2004 mmc intends to continue to ramp up its structural composite products business during 2005 product trials and commercialization continue to be the nearterm focus of mmc however mmc is approximately six months behind plan in commercialization of its structural composites products business improved performance in 2005 is essential to continued investment in this business mmc will continue to evaluate a variety of constructionrelated and commercial uses for composite materials in addition to its use in bridge decks and truck trailers while mmc expects to increase its revenues related to its structural composite products business over the next five years there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable patents and trademarks as of february 18 2005 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 80 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 62 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole customers no material part of the business of either segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof competition because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business competition in the aggregates division tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the company’s individual production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors the company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the united states based on tons shipped there are over 4000 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 26 of the total market the company in its aggregates division competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its 12 

ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access to rail transportation have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in certain extended areas certain of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company the magnesia specialties business of the company’s specialty products division competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with revenues from foreign jurisdictions accounting for approximately 14 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2004 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company the structural composite products business of the company’s specialty products division is a relatively new business that competes or will compete with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of technological advances quality price and technical support the structural composite products business competes or will compete for sales to customers located outside the united states certain of the company’s competitors in the structural composite products business have greater financial resources than the company research and development the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesia specialties business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composite products business at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2004 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 09 million in 2004 06 million in 2003 and 04 million in 2002 on research and development activities environmental and governmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site 13 

the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were 53 million in 2004 and 57 million in 2003 and are related to the company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were less than 1 million in 2004 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2004 or 2003 despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition 14 

with respect to reclamation costs however effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 31 and 32 of the 2004 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred substantial costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” on pages 21 and 22 of this form 10k and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 31 and 32 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” on page 50 of the 2004 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company in general quarry sites must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a mineral commonly called quartz excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease the carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the international agency for research on cancer and later by the us national toxicology program in 1987 the agency found 15 

limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals the national toxicology program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen” in october 1996 the international agency for research on cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humans” the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration both have listed the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of the regulations they expect to have under active consideration for promulgation proposal or review during 2004 the occupational safety and health administration has identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its top five health priorities and developed a draft regulation in 2003 the mine safety and health administration msha did not issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for the development of a crystalline silica standard in may 2004 as had been previously announced the issue is in the prerule status and msha is preparing a detailed risk assessment and plans to complete an external peer review of a draft assessment by february 2005 the company through safety information sheets and other means communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular the clean air act amendments of 1990 required the epa to develop regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants including lime manufacturing the new standards to be established would require plants in the targeted industries to install feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants thereby significantly reducing air emissions the company and other lime manufacturers through the national lime association the leading industry trade association “nla” worked with the epa to define test protocols better define the scope of the standards determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoringreporting requirements for the lime industry the epa received comments on its proposed technologybased standards for the industry in november 2000 and a proposed rule for the national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on december 20 2002 the proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues raised by nla in the negotiation process nla and the company submitted comments on the proposed rules in february 2003 the epa published the final rule in the federal register on january 5 2004 and facilities must be in compliance within three years after the date of publication the company believes that there are several alternatives for achieving compliance with the new technologybased standard and that any costs associated with the upgrade andor replacement of equipment required to comply with the new regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated gdot testing laboratory that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 16 

1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 gdnr requested additional information which was duly submitted the company is waiting for gdnr to approve the plan before implementing it the company is funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 gdnr requested additional information in connection with its consideration of the submitted plan and subsequently approved the plan on july 19 2004 gdot is filing an amendment to the plan and once the amendment is approved by gdnr it is expected that gdot will develop a schedule to implement the plan under georgia law responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding any necessary remediation if the company is required to fund the cost of remediation the company will pursue its right of contribution from the responsible parties management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in the vicinity of and beneath the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan facility there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations magnesia specialties believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to magnesia specialties pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia 17 

specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business employees as of february 18 2005 the company has approximately 5778 employees approximately 4326 are hourly employees and approximately 1452 are salaried employees included among these employees are approximately 837 hourly employees represented by labor unions approximately 14 of the company’s employees approximately 18 of the company’s aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while approximately 98 of the specialty products division’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased chemicals plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2007 the woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2006 available information the company maintains an internet address at httpwwwmartinmariettacom  the company makes available free of charge through its internet web site its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports if any filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act these reports and any amendments are accessed via the company’s web site through a link with the electronic data gathering analysis and retrieval “edgar” system maintained by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” at httpwwwsecgov  accordingly the company’s referenced reports and any amendments are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after the company electronically files such material with or furnishes it to the sec once edgar places such material in its database the company has adopted a code of ethics and standards of conduct that applies to all of its directors officers and employees the company’s code of ethics is available on the company’s internet address at httpwwwmartinmariettacom  the company intends to disclose on its internet 18

 item 1 business general martin marietta materials inc the “company” is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry including highways infrastructure commercial and residential the company also manufactures and markets magnesiabased chemical products used in industrial agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to the steel industry and is developing structural composite products for use in a wide variety of industries in 2003 the company’s aggregates segment accounted for 94 of the company’s total net sales and the company’s specialty products segment accounted for 6 of the company’s total net sales the company was formed in november 1993 as a north carolina corporation to be the successor to substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the materials group of martin marietta corporation and its subsidiaries an initial public offering of a portion of the common stock of the company the “common stock” was completed in february 1994 whereby 8797500 shares of common stock representing approximately 19 of the shares outstanding were sold at an initial public offering price of 23 per share lockheed martin corporation which was formed as the result of a business combination between martin marietta corporation and lockheed corporation in march 1995 owned approximately 81 of the common stock directly and through its wholly owned subsidiary martin marietta investments inc until october 1996 in october 1996 the outstanding common stock of martin marietta materials that was held by lockheed martin corporation became available to the public market when lockheed martin disposed of its 81 ownership interest this transaction was completed by means of a taxfree exchange offer pursuant to which lockheed martin stockholders were given the opportunity to exchange shares of lockheed martin common stock for shares of the company’s common stock which resulted in 100 of the outstanding shares of common stock being publicly traded as of december 4 1998 the company acquired the common stock of redland stone products company “redland stone” from an affiliate of lafarge sa for 272 million in cash plus normal balance sheet liabilities and approximately 8 million estimated for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs the “redland stone acquisition” the company did not assume any longterm debt of redland stone redland stone was a leading producer of aggregates and asphaltic concrete in the state of texas and had mineral reserves which exceeded 10 billion tons the redland stone acquisition expanded the aggregates division’s business by adding operating facilities in the southwest united states expanding the company’s presence in the asphalt production business adding significant longterm mineral reserve capacity and increasing and diversifying the company’s access to rail transportation as of october 31 1998 the company purchased an initial 14 interest in the business of meridian aggregates company “meridian” as of april 3 2001 the company completed the 4 

  purchase of all of the remaining interests of meridian under the purchase option terms of the original investment agreement the purchase consideration consisted of 238 million including the original october 1998 investment of 42 million the retirement of debt the forgiveness of related party obligations and estimated amounts for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs plus the assumption of normal balance sheet liabilities the “meridian acquisition” at the time of the meridian transaction meridian operated 25 aggregates production facilities and seven railserved distribution yards in 11 states in the southwestern and western united states and sold aggregates to customers in 14 states including six states in which the company had not previously conducted any business the meridian acquisition added more than 16 billion tons of aggregates reserves expanded the company’s presence in the southwest and western states and increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation as of may 1 2001 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary martin marietta magnesia specialties “magnesia specialties” sold certain assets related to the refractories portion of its magnesia specialties business to a subsidiary of minerals technologies inc for 34 million the company retained certain current assets including accounts receivable and certain liabilities relating to the refractories business in an accompanying manufacturing agreement magnesia specialties agreed to supply the subsidiary of minerals technologies with certain refractories products at market rates principally from the manistee michigan plant of magnesia specialties for a period of time following the sale this agreement ended in 2002 the sale of magnesia specialties’ refractories business lessened the dependence of the magnesia specialties business on the steel industry in 2002 the company completed a number of sales of nonstrategic operations in its aggregates division including the sale of facilities in illinois iowa ohio oklahoma tennessee and virginia in 2003 the company continued these sales of nonstrategic operations including the sale of facilities in alabama louisiana missouri ohio texas and west virginia in addition in 2003 the magnesia specialties business also disposed of two of its nonstrategic lines of business the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest nonstrategic assets during 2004 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities in 2003 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary martin marietta composites inc “martin marietta composites” opened for business a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for its structural composite products “structural composite products” business business segment information the company operates in two reportable business segments aggregates and specialty products the specialty products segment includes the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business information concerning the company’s total revenues net sales operating profit assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2003 is included in “note o business segments” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 27 and 28 of the company’s 2003 annual report to shareholders the “2003 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference 5 

  aggregates the company’s aggregates division processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries the aggregates division also includes the operation of its other construction materials businesses these businesses acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company includes primarily asphalt ready mix concrete and road paving operations the company is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates in 2003 the company shipped approximately 192 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 31 states in addition to canada and the bahamas generating net sales and earnings from operations of 14 billion and 185 million respectively the aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 46 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population shifts and to changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s aggregates asphalt products and ready mixed concrete are sold and shipped from a network of approximately 353 quarries distribution facilities and plants in 28 states as well as the bahamas and canada although the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states exclusive of road paving operations texas north carolina georgia iowa and indiana account for approximately 54 of total net sales by state of destination the company’s business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected by the continuing recession and weaknesses in these economies the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets as a result of acquisitions in the western and upper midwestern regions of the united states more of the company’s aggregates operations have exposure to weatherrelated risk during the winter months the division’s operations that are concentrated in the northern region of the country experience more severe winter weather conditions than the division’s operations in the southeast and southwest due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the division’s operations near the atlantic and gulf coasts are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years which have had a significant adverse impact on the financial performance of the company in 2003 unlike 2002 the company’s operations were not significantly affected by hurricane or tropical storm activity aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the united states and there are many producers nationwide however as a general rule shipments from an individual quarry are 6 

  limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself as a result proximity of quarry facilities to customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a lowercost river barge and ocean vessel network in addition the redland stone acquisition the meridian acquisition and other recent acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its reach through increased access to rail transportation a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck while the balance of 7 was moved by rail in contrast the company’s aggregates shipments were moved 77 by truck 14 by rail and 9 by water in 2003 the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts the gulf and atlantic coastal areas are being supplied in part from the bahamas location two large quarries on the ohio river system and a canadian quarry on the strait of canso in nova scotia in addition the company’s acquisitions especially the redland stone and meridian acquisitions have expanded its ability to ship by rail accordingly in addition to increasing the company’s geographic presence through acquisitions the company has also enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of certain coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts and to ship products in and to canada and the caribbean as well as to additional geographic areas which can be accessed economically by its expanded distribution system in 2002 the company completed a major project to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its bahamas location which provides the opportunity for the company to capture future potential market growth and reduce costs although there can be no assurance of such growth and cost reductions as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the customer typically does not pay the company a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the meridian acquisition and its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southwest increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power failures and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company’s management believes the overall longterm trend for the construction aggregates industry continues to be one of consolidation although the consolidation trend is slowing as the number of suitable acquisition targets shrinks the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses increased market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new technological opportunities related to the company’s existing markets 7 

  prior to 1998 the company had historically focused on the production of aggregates and had not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction materials businesses the company became significantly more vertically integrated with the redland stone acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the southwest pursuant to which the company has acquired asphaltic concrete ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which establish vertical integration that complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for about 11 of revenues in 2003 with no single operation contributing more than 6 of revenues as the company continues its expansion strategy westward where vertically integrated operations are the norm profit margins are generally adversely affected generally these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations the road paving and trucking businesses have been acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company these operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to the company as a whole in 2003 the company began disposing of some of these operations the company continues to review carefully these operations environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves management believes the aggregates division’s raw materials or aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for current production in its aggregates segment the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand moreover as noted above environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations the company uses various drilling methods depending on the type of aggregate to estimate reserves that are economically mineable the extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site greensite an existing location or a potential acquisition more extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions and in rare cases the company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties subsequent to drilling selected core samples are tested for soundness abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry if the reserves meet the company’s standards and are economically mineable then they are either leased or purchased the company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling proven reserves are reserves of homogenous deposits designated using closely spaced drill data proven 8 

  reserves have a certainty of 85 to 90 probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes andor assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties the degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70 to 75 in determining the amount of reserves the company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths so for deposits such as granite that typically continue to depths well below the ground there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculation the company also deducts loss factors such as property boundaries and plant configurations as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  application of critical accounting policies  property plant and equipment” on pages 4849 of the 2003 annual report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the company the company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory of aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers less than 1 of the aggregates division’s sales are made in foreign jurisdictions principally in canada and the bahamas with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling 146 million 100 million and 65 million during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively specialty products the company’s specialty products division consists of the magnesia specialties business and the structural composite products business   magnesia specialties business  the company in 2003 also manufactured and marketed through magnesia specialties dolomitic lime and magnesiabased chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental uses prior to 2003 magnesia specialties manufactured and marketed certain magnesiabased heatresistant refractories products but sold that business in 2001 and stopped production and sale of these products in 2002 given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of this business excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations in addition magnesia specialties’ dolomitic lime products are and its refractory products were sold primarily to the steel industry accordingly the profitability of the magnesia specialties business has historically depended on the production of steel and the related marketplace and a portion of the product pricing structure of the business has historically been affected by current economic conditions within the steel industry while the sale of the refractories business in 2001 lessened the dependence of magnesia specialties on the steel industry magnesia specialties’ products used in the steel industry still accounted for approximately 50 of the revenues of the business in 2003 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products magnesia specialties has also experienced losses in accounts receivable due to customer bankruptcies competitive pricing pressures in the magnesia specialties business also continued throughout 2003 the chemicals group portion of the magnesia specialties business continued to diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants in wastewater treatment in pulp and paper production and in other 9 

  environmental applications and is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime portion of the magnesia specialties business the principal raw materials used in magnesia specialties’ products are dolomitic limestone brine and imported magnesia management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future once the reserves of brine of the magnesia specialties business are used in the production process the business must dispose of the processed brine typically the business does this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties in 2003 magnesia specialties entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow purchases processed brine from magnesia specialties at market rates for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products magnesia specialties also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan construction of such pipeline was completed in 2003 and dow began purchasing processed brine from magnesia specialties through the pipeline the supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide in 2003 magnesia specialties purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various sources located in china while magnesia specialties does not expect an interruption in the supply of magnesia from these sources various factors associated with economic and political uncertainty in china could result in future supply interruptions if such an interruption were to occur magnesia specialties believes it could obtain alternate supplies worldwide although there could be no assurance that magnesia specialties could do so at current prices alternatively magnesia specialties believes it could adjust its mix of products andor increase production at its manistee michigan plant magnesia specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory for the magnesia specialties products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers approximately 12 of the products of the magnesia specialties business are sold in foreign jurisdictions principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the sales of the business revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled 107 million 89 million and 118 million during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as a result of these foreign sales the financial results of the magnesia specialties business could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of changes in currency exchange rates the magnesia specialties business principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions   structural composite products business  the company in 2003 also manufactured and marketed through martin marietta composites structural composite products for use in a wide variety 10 

  of industries pursuant to various agreements martin marietta composites has rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies related to the company’s business one of the agreements gives martin marietta composites the opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiberreinforced polymer composites technology for products where corrosion resistance and high strengthtoweight ratios are important factors such as bridge decks marine applications and other structures and applications martin marietta composites continued its research and product development activities during 2003 on these structural composites technologies and initiated manufacturing and marketing of selected products in 2002 martin marietta composites leased a 185000 square foot facility in sparta north carolina which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for the structural composite products business of martin marietta composites manufacturing at this facility commenced in the fourth quarter of 2003 with planned product expansion in 2004 martin marietta composites is targeting several industries for its fiberreinforced polymer composite materials infrastructure which includes pedestrian and vehicular bridge decks transportation which includes specialty truck trailers and chassis railcar components and tractor and trailer components and construction which includes wall panels parking decks and heavy equipment components in 2003 martin marietta composites announced the installation of bridge decks in 4 states bringing its total to 25 bridge deck installations in 13 states utilizing these composite materials technologies martin marietta composites continued to explore opportunities to introduce its composite bridge installations to foreign markets martin marietta composites has rights under a licensing agreement executed in 2001 whereby it will manufacture and market commercial specialty truck trailers in north america utilizing fiberreinforced composite materials in 2002 martin marietta composites signed a licensing agreement relating to a proprietary composite sandwich technology which martin marietta composites expects will play an important role in the product line related to flat panel applications martin marietta composites expects to ramp up its structural composite products business during 2004 martin marietta composites will continue to evaluate a variety of constructionrelated and commercial uses for composite materials in addition to its use in bridge decks and truck trailers these composite materials technologies if fully developed by martin marietta composites would complement and expand the company’s business while martin marietta composites expects to increase its revenues related to its structural composite products business over the next five years there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable patents and trademarks as of march 10 2004 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 64 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 46 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole customers no material part of the business of either segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect 11 

  on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof competition because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business competition in the aggregates division tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the company’s individual production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors the company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the united states based on tons shipped there are over 4000 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 31 of the total market the company in its aggregates division competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access to rail transportation as a result of the redland stone and meridian acquisitions and other transactions have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in certain extended areas certain of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company the magnesia specialties business of the company’s specialty products division competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with sales to such customers accounting for approximately 12 of revenues for the magnesia specialties business in 2003 principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim the sale of the refractories business in 2001 has reduced division sales to foreign customers certain of the company’s competitors in the magnesia specialties business have greater financial resources than the company the structural composite products business of the company’s specialty products division is a relatively new business that competes or will compete with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of technological advances quality price and technical support the structural composite products business competes or will compete for sales to customers located outside the united states certain of the company’s competitors in the structural composite products business have greater financial resources than the company research and development the company conducts research and development activities principally for its magnesia specialties business at its plant in manistee michigan and for its structural composite products business at its headquarters in raleigh north carolina and its plant in sparta north carolina in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2003 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies 12 

  including composite materials the company spent approximately 06 million in 2003 04 million in 2002 and 06 million in 2001 on research and development activities environmental and governmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations including the operations of magnesia specialties and martin marietta composites may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation the company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change the accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies new laws that are adopted and new laws that the company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations the company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities the direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were 57 million in 2003 and 46 million in 2002 and are related to the company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters including those matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were less than 1 million in 2003 the company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2003 or 2002 despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations for example plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may as an ordinary course of operations have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone the water spray bar also suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws the company does not break out the portion of the cost depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology the incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify accordingly the company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses 13 

  the environmental accruals recorded by the company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal state andor local environmental protection laws many of these laws and the regulations promulgated under them are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time in addition new laws are adopted from time to time it is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined this process often takes years to finalize and changes significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final the company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances the company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s obligations or financial condition with respect to reclamation costs however effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “fas 143”  see “note a accounting policies” and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 14 through 17 and pages 26 and 27 respectively of the 2003 annual report under fas 143 future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry and are discounted to their present value using a creditadjusted riskfree rate of interest the future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation these activities are performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process for example the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization this sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the mine safety and health administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements therefore these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation historically the company has not incurred extraordinary or substantial costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” on page 20 of this form 10k and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 26 and 27 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” on page 41 of the 14 

  2003 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company in general quarry sites must comply with air quality water quality and noise regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease the carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the international agency for research on cancer and later by the us national toxicology program in 1987 the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals the national toxicology program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen” in october 1996 the international agency for research on cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humans” the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration both have listed the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of the regulations they expect to have under active consideration for promulgation proposal or review during 2004 the occupational safety and health administration has identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its top five health priorities and developed a draft regulation in 2003 the mine safety and health administration has indicated that it intends to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for the development of a crystalline silica standard in may 2004 the company through safety information sheets and other means communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular the clean air act amendments of 1990 required the epa to develop regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants including lime manufacturing the new standards to be established would require plants in the targeted industries to install feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants thereby significantly reducing air emissions the company and other lime manufacturers through the national lime association the leading industry trade association “nla” worked with the epa to define test protocols better define the scope of the standards determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoringreporting requirements for the lime industry the epa received comments on its proposed technologybased standards for the industry in november 2000 and a proposed rule for the national emission standards for lime 15 

  manufacturing plants was released on december 20 2002 the proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues raised by nla in the negotiation process nla and the company submitted comments on the proposed rules in february 2003 the epa published the final rule in the federal register on january 5 2004 and facilities must be in compliance within three years after the date of publication the company believes that there are several alternatives for achieving compliance with the new technologybased standard and that any costs associated with the upgrade andor replacement of equipment required to comply with the new regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated gdot testing laboratory that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 the company is funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 on february 7 2003 gdnr requested additional information in connection with its consideration of the submitted plan and recommended remediation method under georgia law responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding any necessary remediation if the company is required to fund the cost of remediation the company will pursue its right of 16 

  contribution from the responsible parties management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in the vicinity of and beneath the magnesia specialties facility in manistee michigan facility there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations magnesia specialties believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “epa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca’s successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the epa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to magnesia specialties pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that magnesia specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the magnesia specialties property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated magnesia specialties pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with magnesia specialties pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 magnesia specialties entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 20000 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore magnesia specialties is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to magnesia specialties’ brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of the magnesia specialties business employees as of march 10 2004 the company has approximately 5900 employees approximately 4400 are hourly employees and approximately 1500 are salaried employees included among these employees are approximately 800 hourly employees represented by labor unions approximately 14 of the company’s aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while approximately 98 of the specialty products division’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees of the magnesia specialties business at the manistee michigan magnesiabased products plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the current manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2007 the current woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2006 17

utilizing fiberreinforced composite materials late in 2002 the company also signed a licensing agreement relating to a proprietary composite sandwich technology which the company expects will play an important role in the product line related to flat panel applications the company expects to ramp up its composites business during 2003 with 2004 expected to be the first full year of business the company will continue to evaluate a variety of constructionrelated and commercial uses for composite materials in addition to its use in bridge decks and truck trailers these composite materials technologies if fully developed by the company would complement and expand the company’s business while the company expects to increase its revenues related to its composite materials over the next five years there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable the company continued in 2002 to explore the viability of certain technology related to microbial products for enhanced plant growth as expected the company had limited revenue and no profits from these technologies in 2002 and has since abandoned these products also in 1999 and 2000 the company made investments in a startup company that has proprietary microwave technology for use in applications related to industrial heating and drying food processing and aseptic packaging the company had no revenue in 2002 from this investment which was reserved in 2002 the company is replacing its existing information systems with an enterprisewide information solution supplied primarily through j d edwards  company the capital requirements for this multiyear project excluding system replacements for acquired operations not currently using the company’s raleighbased systems principally the redland and meridian acquisitions are expected to be 278 million with 95 million 130 million and 40 million expended in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the timeframe for completion of the various components of this project has not yet been determined the company believes it has deployed sufficient personnel and capital to complete this project successfully business segment information the company in 2002 operated in two reportable business segments aggregates and magnesia specialties information concerning the company’s net sales operating profit assets employed and certain additional information attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2002 is included in “management’s discussion and 6   analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 26 through 51 of the company’s 2002 annual report to shareholders the “2002 annual report” which information is incorporated herein by reference aggregates the company’s aggregates division processes and sells granite limestone sand gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure commercial and residential construction industries the aggregates division also includes the operation of its other construction materials businesses these businesses acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the company includes primarily asphalt ready mix concrete and road paving operations the company is the united states’ second largest producer of aggregates in 2002 the company shipped approximately 189 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 32 states in addition to canada and the bahamas generating net sales and earnings from operations of 14 billion and 170 million respectively the aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction industry with approximately 46 of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with commercial and residential construction projects as a result of dependence upon the construction industry the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population shifts and to changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector the company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area the company’s aggregates and asphalt products and ready mixed concrete are sold and shipped from a network of approximately 360 quarries distribution facilities and plants in 28 states as well as the bahamas and canada although the company’s five largest revenuegenerating states texas north carolina georgia iowa and arkansas account for approximately 54 of total net sales by state of destination the company’s business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected by the continuing recession and weaknesses in these economies the company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its markets as a result of the meridian acquisition the american aggregates acquisition and several other smaller acquisitions in the western and upper midwestern regions of the united states more of the company’s aggregates operations have exposure to weatherrelated risk during the winter months the division’s operations that are concentrated principally in the northern region of the country generally experience more severe winter weather conditions than the division’s operations in the southeast and southwest due to these factors the company’s second and third quarters are generally the strongest with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company’s annual results similarly the division’s operations near the atlantic and gulf coasts are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weatherrelated losses in recent years which have had a significant adverse impact on the financial performance of the company in 2002 12 hurricanes or tropical storms negatively affected the company’s operations by reducing shipments and operating efficiencies and increasing certain operating costs 7   aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the united states and there are many producers nationwide however as a general rule shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself as a result proximity of quarry facilities to customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry as described below the company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks but also has access to a lowercost river barge and ocean vessel network in addition the redland stone acquisition the meridian acquisition and other recent acquisitions have enabled the company to extend its reach through increased access to rail transportation a growing percentage of the company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network in 1994 93 of the company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck while the balance of 7 was moved by rail in contrast the company’s aggregates shipments were moved 77 by truck 14 by rail and 9 by water in 2002  the company has an extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the mississippi river system throughout the central and southern united states and in the bahamas as well as distribution centers along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts the gulf and atlantic coastal areas are being supplied in part from the bahamas location two large quarries on the ohio river system and a canadian quarry on the strait of canso in nova scotia in addition the company’s acquisitions especially the redland stone and meridian acquisitions have expanded its ability to ship by rail accordingly in addition to increasing the company’s geographic presence through acquisitions the company has also enhanced its reach through its ability to provide costeffective coverage of certain coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts and to ship products in and to canada the caribbean and parts of south america as well as to additional geographic areas which can be accessed economically by its expanded distribution system the company recently completed a major project to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its bahamas location which provides the opportunity for the company to capture future potential market growth and reduce costs although there can be no assurance of such growth and cost reductions as the company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins this typically occurs where the company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component margins are negatively affected because the customer typically does not pay the company a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price moreover the meridian acquisition and its railbased distribution network coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the southwest increases the company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance including track congestion crew availability and power failures and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts the waterborne distribution network increases the company’s exposure to certain risks including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts demurrage costs fuel costs barge or ship availability and weather disruptions the company’s management believes the overall longterm trend for the construction aggregates industry continues to be one of consolidation although the consolidation trend is slowing as the number of suitable acquisition targets shrinks the company’s board of directors and management continue to review and monitor the company’s strategic longterm plans which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar 8   businesses increased market share in the company’s core businesses and pursuing new technological opportunities related to the company’s existing markets prior to 1998 the company had historically focused on the production of aggregates and had not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction materials businesses the company became significantly more vertically integrated with the redland stone acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions particularly in the southwest pursuant to which the company has acquired asphaltic concrete ready mixed concrete paving construction trucking and other businesses which establish vertical integration that complement the company’s aggregates business these vertically integrated operations accounted for about 15 of net sales in 2002 with no single operation contributing more than 10 of total net sales as the company continues its expansion strategy westward where vertically integrated operations are the norm profit margins are generally adversely affected generally these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products and are affected by volatile factors including fuel costs operating efficiencies and weather to an even greater extent than the company’s aggregates operations in particular the road paving and trucking businesses have been acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger acquisitions as such they do not represent core businesses of the company these operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to the company as a whole the company continues to review carefully these operations environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters the company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing the value of the company’s existing mineral reserves management believes the aggregates division’s raw materials or mineral reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for production in its aggregates segment the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand the company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory of aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers the company has provided extended payment terms to certain customers depending on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the customer less than 1 of the aggregates division’s sales are made in foreign jurisdictions principally in canada and the bahamas magnesia specialties the company in 2002 also manufactured and marketed dolomitic lime and magnesiabased chemicals products for industrial agricultural and environmental uses as of may 1 2001 the 9   company sold certain assets relating to its magnesiabased heatresistant refractories business of its magnesia specialties segment to a subsidiary of minerals technologies inc but continued to manufacture and sell certain refractories products to the subsidiary of minerals technologies pursuant to a related manufacturing agreement this manufacturing agreement ended in 2002 and the magnesia specialties division has stopped production and sale of these magnesiabased refractory products previously sold directly to the steel industry given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of this division excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations in addition magnesia specialties’ dolomitic lime products are and its refractory products were sold primarily to the steel industry accordingly the division’s profitability has historically depended on the production of steel and the related marketplace and a portion of the division’s product pricing structure has historically been affected by current business economic conditions within the steel industry while the sale of magnesia specialties’ refractories business in 2001 lessened the magnesia specialties division’s dependence on the steel industry magnesia specialties’ products used in the steel industry still accounted for approximately 52 of the division’s net sales in 2002 attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products the magnesia specialties division has also experienced losses in accounts receivable due to customer bankruptcies and is further exposed to additional potential losses in customer accounts receivable if the steel industry continues to deteriorate competitive pricing pressures in the magnesia specialties’ division also continued throughout 2002 the division’s chemicals group continued to diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants in wastewater treatment in pulp and paper production and to reduce stack pollution and is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime business the principal raw materials used in the company’s magnesia specialties division’s products are dolomitic limestone brine and imported magnesia management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the required operational levels for the foreseeable future once the magnesia specialties division’s reserves of brine are used in the production process the division must dispose of the processed brine typically the division does this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in manistee michigan the division has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties the magnesia specialties division recently entered into a longterm processed brine supply agreement with the dow chemical company “dow” pursuant to which dow will purchase processed brine from the magnesia specialties division for use in dow’s production of calcium chloride products the magnesia specialties division also entered into a venture with dow to construct own and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the magnesia specialties division’s facility in manistee michigan and dow’s facility in ludington michigan the supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide in 2002 the company purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various sources located in china while the company does not expect an interruption in the supply of magnesia from these sources various factors associated with economic and political uncertainty in china could result in future supply interruptions if such an interruption were to occur the company believes it could obtain alternate supplies worldwide although there could be no assurance that the company could do so at current prices 10   alternatively the company believes it could adjust its mix of products andor increase production at its manistee michigan plant the company generally delivers its magnesia specialties division’s products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers accordingly there is no significant backlog information inventory for the magnesia specialties division’s products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers the company has provided extended payment terms to certain international customers approximately 12 of the magnesia specialties division’s products are sold in foreign jurisdictions principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim but no single country accounts for 10 or more of the division’s sales as a result of these foreign sales the division’s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets to mitigate the shortterm effects of changes in currency exchange rates the division principally uses the us dollar as the functional currency in foreign transactions patents and trademarks as of march 20 2003 the company owns has the right to use or has pending applications for approximately 65 patents pending or granted by the united states and various countries and approximately 46 trademarks related to business the company believes that its rights under its existing patents patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the company’s business as a whole customers no material part of the business of either segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment the company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof competition because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business competition tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the company’s individual production facilities although all of the company’s locations experience competition the company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves competition is based primarily on quarry location and price but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors the company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the united states based on tons shipped there are over 4000 companies in the united states that produce aggregates the largest five producers account for approximately 25 of the total market the company competes with a number of other large and small producers the company believes that its ability to transport 11   materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access to rail transportation as a result of the redland stone and meridian acquisitions and other transactions have enhanced the company’s ability to compete in certain extended areas certain of the company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the company the magnesia specialties division of the company competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the magnesia specialties division also competes for sales to customers located outside the united states with sales to such customers accounting for approximately 89 million in net sales in 2002 representing approximately 12 of net sales of the magnesia specialties segment principally in canada mexico europe south america and the pacific rim the sale of the refractories business in 2001 has reduced division sales to foreign customers the magnesia specialties division’s sales to foreign customers were 118 million in 2001 and 204 million in 2000 research and development the company conducts research and development activities for its magnesia specialties segment at its plant in manistee michigan and at various locations for the new proprietary technologies in general the company’s research and development efforts in 2002 were directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary technologies including composite materials the company spent approximately 04 million in 2002 06 million in 2001 and 23 million in 2000 on research and development activities environmental and governmental regulations the company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety and other regulatory matters certain of the company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations environmental operating permits are or may be required for certain of the company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations despite these compliance efforts risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company’s businesses as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future in accordance with the company’s accounting policy for environmental costs prior to january 1 2003 amounts were not accrued and included in the company’s financial statements until it was probable that a liability had been incurred and such amounts could be estimated reasonably the environmental accruals were estimated based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and generally not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims costs incurred by the company in connection with environmental matters in the preceding two fiscal years were not material to the company’s operations or financial condition effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations see “note a accounting policies” of the “notes to financial statements” on pages 14 through 16 of the 2002 annual report 12   the company believes that its operations and facilities both owned or leased are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” on page 17 of this form 10k and “note n commitments and contingencies” of the “notes to financial statements” on page 25 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental regulation and litigation” on page 41 of the 2002 annual report however future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company in general quarry sites must comply with noise water discharge and air quality regulations zoning and special use permitting requirements applicable mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements as new quarry sites are located and acquired the company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries in such a way as to minimize disturbances the company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property owners also the company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas the company maintains a centralized blasting procedure for its quarry operations and has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners the company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use the company generally reclaims its quarries on an ongoing basis reclaiming minedout areas of the quarry while continuing operations at other areas of the site historically the company has not incurred extraordinary or substantial costs in connection with the closing of quarries reclaimed quarry sites owned by the company are available for sale typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs as is the case with other companies in the same industry some of the company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica a common mineral excessive prolonged inhalation of very smallsized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease the carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the international agency for research on cancer and later by the us national toxicology program in 1987 the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals the national toxicology program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen” in october 1996 the international agency for research on cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humans” the mine safety and health administration has included the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of its longterm goals the occupational safety and health administration has identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its top five health priorities and committed itself to rulemaking targeting november 2003 on its regulatory calendar for proposed regulation the company through safety information sheets and other means communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular 13   the clean air act amendments of 1990 require the epa to develop regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants including lime manufacturing the new standards to be established would require plants to install feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants thereby significantly reducing air emissions the company is actively participating with other lime manufacturers in working with the epa to define test protocols better define the scope of the standards determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoringreporting requirements for the lime industry the epa has conducted testing at lime manufacturing facilities located in alabama texas and ohio including the company’s woodville facility the results of which were discussed with the epa in 1999 to determine whether the facilities should be subject to these regulations the epa received comments on its proposed technologybased standards for the industry in november 2000 and a proposed rule for the national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on december 20 2002 the proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues raised by nla in the negotiation process nla and the company submitted comments on the proposed rules in february 2003 the company expects the proposed rules to be finalized at some point during the last half of 2003 the usepa proposed that facilities must be in compliance within three years after the date of the publication of the final rule in the federal register the company believes that any costs associated with the upgrade andor replacement of equipment required to comply with the new regulations would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the magnesia specialties segment’s operations in february 1998 the georgia department of natural resources “gdnr” determined that both the company and the georgia department of transportation “gdot” are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the company’s camak quarry in thomson georgia due to the discovery of trichloroethene “tce” above its naturally occurring background concentration in a drinking water well on site the company provided the gdnr with information indicating that the source of the release was either from an asphalt plant that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the company purchased the property the company entered into a consent order with gdnr to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the findings the company and gdot signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work the assessment report was completed and filed based upon the results of the assessment report gdot withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs the company submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on december 9 2002 the company is funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in december 1998 the gdnr determined that the company the gdot and two former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at the company’s ruby quarry in macon georgia the company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property gdot was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site the two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site the groundwater contamination was discovered when the company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was conducted the company and gdot signed an agreement to share the 14   costs of the assessment work the report of the assessment work was filed with the gdnr gdot entered into a consent order with gdnr agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation at the site on may 21 2001 gdnr issued separate administrative orders against the company and other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with gdot to undertake additional testing and any necessary remediation the company and gdot submitted a corrective action plan to gdnr for approval on may 20 2002 if the company is required to fund the cost of remediation the company will pursue its right of contribution from the responsible parties management believes any costs incurred by the company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition in the vicinity of and beneath the magnesia specialties division’s manistee michigan facility there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by packaging corporation of america “pca” as a part of its operations the company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste on september 8 1983 the pca plume and property were listed on the national priorities list “npl” under the authority of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “superfund” statute the pca plume is subject to a record of decision issued by the us environmental protection agency “usepa” on may 2 1994 pursuant to which pca and now its successor pactiv corporation “pactiv” is required to conduct annual monitoring the usepa has not required remediation of the groundwater contamination on january 10 2002 the michigan department of environmental quality “mdeq” issued notice of demand letters to the company pca and pactiv indicating that it believes that the company’s chloride contamination is commingling with the pca plume which originates upgradient from the company’s property the mdeq is concerned about possible effects of these plumes and designated the company pca and pactiv as parties responsible for investigation and remediation under michigan state law the mdeq held separate meetings with the company pca and pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling approximately 700000 the company entered into an administrative order with the mdeq to pay for a portion of mdeq’s past investigation costs and thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of 2007362 michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary remediation michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if it is capable of division the company believes that the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to the company’s brine contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the magnesia specialties segment’s operations employees as of march 20 2003 the company has approximately 6400 employees approximately 4800 are hourly employees and approximately 1600 are salaried employees included among these employees are approximately 760 hourly employees represented by labor unions approximately 12 of the company’s aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union while approximately 98 of the magnesia specialties division’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions the company’s principal union contracts cover employees at the manistee michigan magnesiabased products plant and the woodville ohio lime plant the current manistee collective bargaining agreement expires in august 2003 there can be no assurance that a successor agreement 15   will be reached at the manistee location in 2003 the current woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in june 2006

quarries and distribution yards in 28 states and in canada and the bahamas of which 100 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 71 are on land owned in part and leased in part 149 are on leased land and 17 are on facilities neither owned nor leased where raw materials are removed under an agreement the company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production based on current levels of activity however certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand in addition the company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete andor asphalt products from 25 properties in 5 states of which 12 are located on land owned by the company free of major encumbrances 2 are on land owned in part and leased in part and 11 are on leased land magnesia specialties the magnesia specialties division currently operates a major manufacturing facility in manistee michigan and smaller processing plants in bridgeport connecticut and lenoir city tennessee all of these facilities are owned except lenoir city which is leased the company has also entered into several thirdparty tollmanufacturing agreements pursuant to which it processes various chemical products in addition in 2001 the company transferred operating responsibility for its woodville ohio dolomitic lime operation from its magnesia specialties division to the midamerica 16   division of its aggregates division but the woodville ohio operations will continue to be reported by the company within the magnesia specialties segment the woodville ohio facilities are owned other properties the company’s principal corporate office which it owns is located in raleigh north carolina the company owns and leases various administrative offices and research and development laboratories for its two reportable business segments and other related businesses the company also leases a plant in sparta north carolina which the company is currently fitting up to serve as an assembly plant for its structural composites business the company’s principal properties which are of varying ages and are of different construction types are believed to be generally in good condition are generally well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 80 and are capable of supporting a higher level of market demand item 3 legal proceedings from time to time claims of various types are asserted against the company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business including claims relating to land use and permits safety health and environmental matters such as noise abatement vibrations air emissions and water discharges such matters are subject to many uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any from these matters in the opinion of management of the company which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations or its financial condition however there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its
